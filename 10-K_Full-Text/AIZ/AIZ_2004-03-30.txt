PART I

Item 1.

Business

Assurant, Inc. (Assurant) is a Delaware
corporation, formed in connection with the initial public
offering of its Common Stock, which began trading on the
New York Stock Exchange on February 5, 2004. Prior to
that initial trading date, Fortis, Inc., a Nevada
corporation, had formed Assurant and merged into it on
February 4, 2004. The merger was executed in order to
redomesticate Fortis, Inc. from Nevada to Delaware and to
change its name. As a result of the merger, Assurant is the
successor to the business operations and obligations of
Fortis, Inc.

Prior to the offering 100% of the outstanding
common stock of Fortis, Inc. was owned indirectly by Fortis
N.V., a public company with limited liability incorporated as
naamloze vennootschap under Dutch law, and Fortis SA/ NV, a
public company with limited liability incorporated as
société anonyme/naamloze vennootschap under Belgian
law. Following the offering, Fortis N.V. and Fortis SA/ NV,
through a wholly owned subsidiary Fortis Insurance N.V., now own
approximately 35% of the outstanding common stock of Assurant.

In this report, references to the
“Company,” “Assurant,” “we,”
“us” or “our” refer to
(1) Fortis, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and
(2) Assurant, Inc. and its subsidiaries after the
consummation of the merger described above. References to
“Fortis” refer collectively to Fortis N.V. and Fortis
SA/ NV. References to our “separation” from Fortis
refer to the fact that Fortis reduced its ownership of our
common stock in connection with the offering.

Overview

We pursue a differentiated strategy of building
leading positions in specialized market segments for insurance
products and related services in North America and selected
other markets. We provide creditor-placed homeowners insurance,
manufactured housing homeowners insurance, debt protection
administration, credit insurance, warranties and extended
service contracts, individual health and small employer group
health insurance, group dental insurance, group disability
insurance, group life insurance and pre-funded funeral insurance.

The markets we target are generally complex, have
a relatively limited number of competitors and, we believe,
offer attractive profit opportunities. In these markets, we
leverage the experience of our management team and apply our
expertise in risk management, underwriting and
business-to-business management, as well as our technological
capabilities in complex administration and systems. Through
these activities, we seek to generate above-average returns by
building on specialized market knowledge, well-established
distribution relationships and economies of scale.

As a result of our strategy, we are a leader in
many of our chosen markets and products. In our Assurant
Solutions business, we have leadership positions or are aligned
with clients who are leaders in creditor-placed homeowners
insurance based on servicing volume, manufactured housing
homeowners insurance based on number of homes built and debt
protection administration based on credit card balances
outstanding. In our Assurant Employee Benefits business, we are
a leading writer of group dental plans sponsored by employers
based on the number of subscribers and based on the number of
master contracts in force. A master contract refers to a single
contract issued to an employer that provides coverage on a group
basis; group members receive certificates, which summarize
benefits provided and serve as evidence of membership. In our
Assurant PreNeed business, we are the largest writer of
pre-funded funeral insurance measured by face amount of new
policies sold. We believe that our leadership positions give us
a sustainable competitive advantage in our chosen markets.

We currently have four decentralized operating
business segments to ensure focus on critical activities close
to our target markets and customers, while simultaneously
providing centralized support in key functions. Each operating
business segment has its own experienced management team with
the autonomy to make decisions on key operating matters. These
managers are eligible to receive incentive-based compensation
based in part on operating business segment performance and in
part on company-wide performance,



thereby encouraging strong business performance
and cooperation across all our businesses. At the operating
business segment level, we stress disciplined underwriting,
careful analysis and constant improvement and product redesign.
At the corporate level, we provide support services, including
investment, asset/liability matching and capital management,
leadership development, information technology support and other
administrative and finance functions, enabling the operating
business segments to focus on their target markets and
distribution relationships while enjoying the economies of scale
realized by operating these businesses together. Also, our
overall strategy and financial objectives are set and
continuously monitored at the corporate level to ensure that our
capital resources are being properly allocated.

We organize and manage our specialized businesses
through four operating business segments:

(1)

DRMS refers to Disability Reinsurance Management
    Services, Inc., one of our wholly owned subsidiaries that
    provides a turnkey facility to other insurers to write
    principally group disability insurance.



We also have a Corporate and Other segment, which
includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses,
net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income
earned from short-term investments held and interest income from
excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other
segments. The Corporate and Other segment includes the results
of operations of Fortis Financial Group (FFG) from
January 1, 2001 to March 31, 2001 (the period prior to
its disposition). The Corporate and Other segment also includes
the amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions
of the sales of FFG and Long Term Care (LTC), a business sold on
March 1, 2000, through reinsurance agreements as described
elsewhere in this document. See “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Corporate and Other.”

For the year ended December 31

,

2003,
we generated total revenues of $7,066 million and net
income of $186 million. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, we generated total revenues of
$6,532 million, net income before cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle of $260 million and net loss
of $1,001 million (after giving effect to a cumulative
change in accounting principle of $1,261 million). As of
December 31, 2003, we had total assets of approximately
$23,728 million, including separate accounts. Our A.M. Best
financial strength ratings are either A (“Excellent”)
or A-(“Excellent”) for all of our domestic operating
insurance subsidiaries. A rating of “A” is the second
highest of ten ratings categories and the highest within the
category based on modifiers (i.e., A and A- are
“Excellent”) and a rating of “A-” is the
second highest of ten ratings categories and the lowest within
the category based on modifiers. We view the A.M. Best ratings
as most relevant for the purpose of managing our businesses
because these ratings relate to capital management at our
insurance subsidiaries. These ratings reflect A.M. Best’s
opinions of our ability to pay policyholder claims, are not
applicable to our common stock or debt securities and are not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, including our
common stock.

Assurant Solutions

Assurant Solutions, which we began operating with
the acquisition of American Security Group in 1980, has
leadership positions or is aligned with clients who are leaders
in creditor-placed homeowners insurance and related mortgage
tracking services based on servicing volume, manufactured
housing homeowners insurance based on number of homes built and
debt protection administration based on credit card balances
outstanding. We develop, underwrite and market our specialty
insurance products and services through collaborative
relationships with our clients (financial institutions,
retailers, manufactured housing and automobile dealers,
utilities and other entities) to their customers. We serve our
clients throughout North America, the Caribbean and selected
countries in South America and Europe.

Our principal business lines within our Assurant
Solutions segment have experienced growth in varying degrees.
Growth in premiums in the homeowners market has been driven by
increased home purchase activity due to the low interest rate
environment, appreciation in home values, an increasing
percentage of the population purchasing homes and mortgage
industry consolidation. The manufactured housing market has been
more challenging because of a more restrictive lending
environment with fewer lenders extending credit and increasingly
strict underwriting standards being applied since the late
1990’s. Finally, the domestic consumer credit insurance
market has been contracting due to an adverse regulatory
environment; however, this decline has been offset somewhat by
accelerating growth in the debt protection market. This adverse
regulatory environment has included, in the last few years, many
state regulatory interpretations that impose rigorous agent
licensing requirements for employees of lenders who offer credit
insurance products as well as federal legislation which
dissuades, and various state laws that either dissuade or
prohibit, financial institutions from financing single premium
credit or other credit insurance on consumer or home loans
secured by real estate.

In Assurant Solutions, we provide specialty
property and consumer protection products and services. In our
specialty property solutions division, our strategy is to
further develop our creditor-placed homeowners and manufactured
housing homeowners insurance products and related services in
order to maintain our leadership position or relationships with
clients who are leaders and to gain market share in the mortgage
and manufactured housing industries, as well as to develop our
renters’ insurance product line. Renters’ insurance
generally provides coverage for the contents of a renter’s
home or apartment and for liability. In our consumer protection
solutions division, we intend to continue to focus on being a
low-cost provider of debt protection administration services, to
leverage our administrative infrastructure with our large
customer base clients and to manage the switch from credit
insurance programs to debt protection programs in the United
States.



The following table provides net earned premiums
and other considerations and fees and other income for Assurant
Solutions for the periods indicated:

Products and Services

Specialty Property
Solutions.

We underwrite a variety of
creditor-placed and voluntary homeowners insurance as well as
property coverages on manufactured housing, specialty
automobiles, including antique automobiles, recreational
vehicles, including motorcycles and watercraft, and leased and
financed equipment. We also offer complementary programs such as
flood insurance, renters’ insurance and various other
property coverages. We are a leading provider of creditor-placed
and other collateral protection insurance programs based on
number of homes built. These other collateral protection
insurance programs may include those that protect a
lender’s interest in homes, manufactured homes and
automobiles. We also offer administration services for some of
the largest mortgage lenders and servicers, manufactured housing
lenders, dealers and vertically integrated builders and
equipment leasing institutions in the United States. Many of our
products and services are sold in conjunction with the sale or
lease of the underlying property, vehicle or equipment by our
clients. Our market strategy is to establish relationships with
institutions who are leaders in their chosen markets and
therefore can effectively and efficiently distribute our
products and services to large customer bases.

The homeowners insurance product line is our
largest line in the specialty property solutions division and
accounted for approximately 13.9% of Assurant Solutions’
net earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The primary program within this line is our creditor-placed
homeowners insurance. Creditor-placed homeowners insurance
generally consists of fire and dwelling insurance that we
provide to ensure collateral protection to a mortgage lender in
the event that a homeowner fails to purchase or renew homeowners
insurance on a mortgaged dwelling. In our typical arrangements
with our mortgage lender and servicer clients, we agree that we
will monitor the client’s mortgage loan portfolio over time
to verify the existence of homeowners insurance protecting the
lender’s interest in the underlying properties. We have
developed a proprietary insurance tracking and administration
process to verify the existence of insurance on a mortgaged
property. In situations where such mortgaged property does not
have appropriate insurance and after notification to the
mortgageholder of the failure to have such insurance, we issue
creditor-placed insurance policies to ensure the mortgaged
property is protected.

We also provide fee-based services to our
mortgage lender and servicer clients in the creditor-placed
homeowners insurance administration area, which services are
complementary to our insurance products. Our ability to offer
these services is a critical factor in establishing
relationships with our clients. The vast majority of our
mortgage lender and servicer clients outsource their insurance
processing to us. These fee-based services include receipt of
the insurance-related mail, matching of insurance information to
specific loans, payment of insurance premiums on escrowed
accounts, insurance-related customer service, loss draft
administration and other related services. Loss drafts refers to
the payment of insurance proceeds for a claim resulting from a
loss to insured mortgage property.

The second largest specialty property line in the
specialty property solutions division is homeowners insurance
for owners of manufactured homes, which accounted for
approximately 9.3% of Assurant Solutions’



net earned premiums for the year ended
December 31, 2003. We primarily distribute our manufactured
housing insurance programs utilizing three marketing channels.
Our primary channel is the nation’s leading manufactured
housing retailers based on number of homes built. Through our
proprietary premium rating technology, which is integrated with
our clients’ sales process, we are able to offer our
property coverages at the time the home is being sold, thus
enhancing our ability to penetrate the new home point-of-sale
market place. We also offer our programs to independent
specialty agents who distribute our products to individuals
subsequent to new home purchases. Finally, we perform the
collateral tracking, homeowners insurance placement and
administration services for these leading manufactured housing
lending organizations. Through these collaborative
relationships, we place our homeowners coverage on the
manufactured home in the event that the homeowner fails to
obtain or renew homeowners coverage on the home. In a typical
arrangement with a manufactured housing lending organization, we
agree to monitor the organization’s portfolio of loans over
time to verify the existence of homeowners insurance protecting
the organization’s interest in the underlying manufactured
homes.

We also provide voluntary homeowners insurance
and voluntary manufactured housing homeowners insurance, which
generally provide comprehensive coverage for the structure,
contents and liability, as well as coverage for floods.

Consumer Protection
Solutions.

We offer a broad array of
credit insurance programs, debt protection services and product
warranties and extended service contracts, all of which are
consumer-related, both domestically and in selected
international markets. Consumer protection products and services
accounted for approximately 69.0% of Assurant Solutions’
net earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Credit insurance and debt protection programs generally offer a
consumer a convenient option to protect a credit card or
installment loan in the event of a disability, unemployment or
death so that the amount of coverage purchased equals the amount
of outstanding debt. Under the credit insurance program, the
loan or credit card balance is paid off in the case of death
and, in the case of unemployment or disability, payments are
made on a loan until the covered holder is employed again or
medically able to return to work. Under the terms and conditions
of a debt protection agreement, the monthly interest due from a
customer may be waived or the monthly payments may be paid for a
covered life event, such as disability, unemployment or family
leave. Most often in the case of the death of a covered account
holder, the debt is extinguished under the debt protection
program. Coverage is generally available to all consumers
without the underwriting restrictions that apply to term life
insurance. Term life insurance is life insurance written for a
specified period and under which no cash value is generally
available on surrender, such as medical examinations and medical
history reports. We are the exclusive provider of debt
protection administration services and credit insurance for four
of the six largest general purpose credit card issuers in the
United States based on credit card balances outstanding.

Almost all of the largest credit card issuing
institutions in the United States have switched from offering
credit insurance to their credit card customers to offering
their own banking-approved debt protection programs. Assurant
Solutions has been able to maintain all of its major credit card
clients as they switched from our credit insurance programs to
their debt protection programs. We earn fee income rather than
net earned premiums from our debt protection administration
services. In addition, margins are lower in debt protection
administration than in traditional credit insurance programs.
However, because debt protection is not an insurance product,
certain costs, such as regulatory costs and costs of capital,
are expected to be eliminated as the transition from credit
insurance to debt protection administration services continues.
The fees from debt protection administration do not fully
compensate for the decrease in credit insurance premiums. In
addition, we continue to provide credit insurance programs for
many leading retailers, consumer finance companies and other
institutions who are involved in consumer lending transactions.
For the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2002, our net earned premiums in the
U.S. credit insurance business decreased by approximately
$178 million while debt protection fee income increased by
$21 million. However, the decrease in credit insurance net
earned premiums is not analogous to the increase in debt
protection fee income because in the credit insurance business
we bear insurance risk and pay claims, whereas in the debt
protection business we bear no insurance risk and we collect
fees for the administrative services we render.



We also underwrite, and provide administration
services on, warranties and extended service contracts on
appliances, consumer electronics, including personal computers,
cellular phones and other wireless devices, and vehicles,
including automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats. Our
strategy is to provide our clients with all aspects of the
warranty or extended service contract, including: program
design, marketing strategy, technologically advanced
administration, claims handling and customer service. We believe
that we maintain a differentiated position in the marketplace as
a provider of both the required administrative infrastructure
and insurance underwriting capabilities.

On September 26, 2003, Assurant Solutions
entered into an agreement with General Electric to become the
obligor and insurer of all extended service contracts issued
directly by entities of GE Consumer Products and their clients.
In addition, Assurant Solutions has become the administrator of
service contracts covering personal computer products as well as
a variety of lawn and garden products.

Marketing and Distribution

Assurant Solutions markets its insurance programs
and administration services directly to large financial
institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, credit card
issuers, finance companies, automobile retailers, consumer
electronics retailers, manufactured housing lenders, dealers and
vertically integrated builders and other institutions.

Assurant Solutions enters into exclusive and
other distribution agreements, typically with terms of one to
five years, and develops interdependent systems with its clients
that permit Assurant Solutions’ information systems to
interface with its clients’ systems in order to exchange
information in a seamless and integrated manner. Through its
long-standing relationships, Assurant Solutions has access to
numerous potential policyholders and, in collaboration with its
clients can tailor its products to suit various market segments.
Assurant Solutions maintains a dedicated sales force that
establishes and maintains relationships with its clients.
Assurant Solutions has a multiple step business development
process that is employed by its direct sales force. This
multiple step business development process is a sales
methodology for contacting, negotiating and consummating
business relationships with new clients and enhancing business
relationships with existing clients. Assurant Solutions
maintains a specialized consumer acquisition marketing services
group that manages its direct marketing efforts on behalf of its
clients.

In the United States, we have strong distribution
relationships with six out of the ten largest mortgage lenders
and servicers based on servicing volume, four out of the seven
largest manufactured housing builders based on number of homes
built, four out of the six largest general purpose credit card
issuers based on credit card balances outstanding and five out
of the ten largest consumer electronics and appliances retailers
based on combined product sales, with an average relationship of
at least 10 years.

Underwriting and Risk Management

We, along with Assurant Solutions’
predecessors, have over 50 years of experience in providing
specialty insurance programs and therefore maintain extensive
proprietary actuarial databases and catastrophe models. We
believe these databases and catastrophe models enable us to
better identify and quantify the expected loss experience of
particular products and are employed in the design of our
products and the establishment of rates.

We have a disciplined approach to the management
of our property product lines. We monitor pricing adequacy on a
product by region, state, risk and producer. Subject to
regulatory considerations, we seek to make timely commission,
premium and coverage modifications where we determine them to be
appropriate. In addition, we maintain a segregated risk
management area for property exposures whose emphasis includes
catastrophic exposure management, reinsurance purchasing and
analytical review of profitability based on various catastrophe
models. We do not underwrite in our creditor-placed homeowners
insurance line, as our contracts with our clients require that
we automatically issue these policies, after notice, when a
policyholder’s homeowners policy lapses or is terminated.



A distinct characteristic of our credit insurance
programs is that the majority of these products have relatively
low exposures. This is because policy size is equal to the size
of the installment loan or credit card balance. Thus, loss
severity for most of this business is low relative to other
insurance companies writing more traditional lines of insurance.
For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes
(for example, our homeowners policies), we monitor and manage
our aggregate risk exposure by geographic area and have entered
into reinsurance treaties to manage our exposure to these types
of events.

Also, a significant portion of Assurant
Solutions’ consumer protection solutions contracts are
written on a retrospective commission basis, which permits
Assurant Solutions to adjust commissions based on claims
experience. Under this contingent commission arrangement, as
permitted, compensation to the financial institutions and other
clients is predicated upon the actual losses incurred compared
to premiums earned after a specific net allowance to Assurant
Solutions, which we believe aligns our clients’ interests
with ours and helps us to better manage risk exposure.

In Assurant Solutions, our claims processing is
automated and combines the efficiency of centralized claims
handling, customer service centers and the flexibility of field
representatives. This flexibility adds savings and efficiencies
to the claims-handling process. Our claims department also
provides automated feedback to help with risk assessment and
pricing. In our specialty property solutions division, we
complement our automated claims processing with field
representatives who manage the claims process on the ground
where and when needed.

Assurant Health

Assurant Health, which we began operating with
the acquisition of Time Holdings, Inc. (now Fortis
Insurance Company) in 1978, is a writer of individual and
short-term major medical health insurance. We also provide small
employer group health insurance to employer groups primarily of
two to fifty employees in size, and health insurance plans to
full-time college students. We serve approximately
1.1 million people throughout the United States. We were
one of the first companies to offer a Medical Savings Account
(MSA) feature as part of our individual health products and
we continue to be a provider of MSA-linked individual health
policies. MSAs are tax-sheltered savings accounts earmarked for
medical expenses and are established in conjunction with one of
our PPO or indemnity products.

We expect growth in the health insurance market
to be driven by inflation and increases in the cost of providing
medical care as well as growth in demand for individual and
small group medical products. We generally expect medical cost
inflation to be a principal driver of growth in this market;
however, reduced funding of health insurance by employers and
the increasing attractiveness and flexibility of MSAs could
create opportunities for the individual medical insurance market
to expand. We believe that the number of persons covered by
individually purchased health insurance as well as the number of
small employer groups in the United States will increase
primarily as a result of the recently passed Medicare
Prescription & Modernization Act, which includes a
provision for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) that we believe
will increase health insurance options available to consumers
and make health insurance more affordable.

In Assurant Health, we intend to continue to
concentrate on developing our product capabilities in the
individual health insurance market. From 2000 through 2003, we
have increased the relative percentage of individual health
insurance products to our total health insurance products from
approximately 30% of premium dollars to approximately 50% of
premium dollars. We have pursued a variety of distribution
relationships focused on the individual health insurance market.
We seek to maintain the lowest combined ratio of any of our
major competitors serving the health care financing needs of
individuals, families and small employer groups. We have made
progress in achieving this goal and believe we currently have
one of the lowest combined ratios in our industry based on the
reported results of publicly-traded managed care and health
insurance companies as of December 31, 2003.



The following table provides net earned premiums
and other considerations, fees and other income and other
operating data for Assurant Health for the periods and as of the
dates indicated:

(1)

The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits
    divided by net earned premiums and other considerations.

(2)

The expense ratio is equal to selling,
    underwriting and general expenses divided by net earned premiums
    and other considerations and fees and other income.

(3)

The combined ratio is equal to total benefits,
    losses and expenses divided by net earned premiums and other
    considerations and fees and other income.

Products and Services

Individual Health Insurance
Products.

Assurant Health’s
individual health insurance products are sold to individuals,
primarily between the ages of 18 and 64 years, and their
families who do not have employer-sponsored coverage. Due to
increasingly stringent federal and state restrictions relating
to insurance policies sold directly to individuals, we emphasize
the sale of individual products through associations and trusts
that act as the master policyholder for such products. Our
association and trust products offer greater flexibility in
pricing, underwriting and product design compared to products
sold directly to individuals on a true individual policy basis.

Substantially all of the individual health
insurance products we sell are PPO plans, which offer the member
the ability to select any health care provider, with benefits
reimbursed at a higher level when care is received from a
participating network provider. Coverage is typically subject to
co-payments or deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost
sharing for covered services limited by lifetime policy maximums
of $2 million or $3 million, with options to purchase
between $6 million and $8 million. Product features
often included in these plans are inpatient pre-certification
and benefits for preventative services. These products are
individually underwritten taking into account the member’s
medical history and other factors, and consist primarily of
major medical insurance that renews on an annual basis. The
remaining products we sell are indemnity, or fee-for-service,
plans. Indemnity plans offer the member the ability to select
any health care provider for covered services.



At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had total
in force medical certificates of 304,400 and 264,100,
respectively, covering approximately 613,000 and 520,000
individuals, respectively. Approximately 15% and 14% of the
individual health insurance products we sold in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, included an MSA.

Assurant Health markets additional products to
the individual market: short-term medical insurance and student
health coverage plans. The short-term medical insurance product
is designed for individuals who are between jobs or seeking
interim coverage before their major medical coverage becomes
effective. Short-term medical insurance products are generally
sold to individuals with gaps in coverage for six months or
less. Student health coverage plans are medical insurance plans
sold to full-time college students who are not covered by their
parents’ health insurance, are no longer eligible for
dependant coverage or are seeking a more comprehensive
alternative to a college-sponsored plan.

Small Employer Health Insurance
Products.

Our small employer market
primarily includes companies with two to fifty employees,
although larger employer coverage is available. Our average
group size, as of December 31, 2003, was approximately
5 employees. In the case of our small employer group
medical insurance, we underwrite the entire group and examine
the medical risk factors of the individuals in the group for
forecasting and reserving purposes.

Substantially all of the small employer health
insurance products that we sold in 2002 and 2003 were PPO
products. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had total in
force medical certificates of 205,300 and 196,500, respectively,
covering approximately 376,000 and 355,000 individuals,
respectively. The number of small employer groups as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002 were approximately 37,700 and
37,400, respectively.

We recently introduced Health Reimbursement
Accounts (HRAs), which are employer-funded accounts provided to
employees for reimbursement of qualifying medical expenses. We
also offer certain ancillary products to meet the demands of
small employers for life insurance, short-term disability
insurance and dental insurance. In addition, beginning in
January 2004, we began offering HSA products to individuals and
small employer groups.

Marketing and Distribution

Our health insurance products are principally
marketed to an extensive network of independent agents by
Assurant Health distributors. Approximately 150,000 agents
had access to Assurant Health products during the 2003 calendar
year. We also market our products to individuals through a
variety of exclusive and non-exclusive national account
relationships and direct distribution channels. In addition, we
market our products through NorthStar Marketing, a wholly owned
affiliate that proactively seeks business directly from
independent agents. Since 2000, Assurant Health has had an
exclusive national marketing agreement with Insurance Placement
Service, Inc. (IPSI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), pursuant
to which IPSI captive agents market Assurant Health’s
individual health products. Captive agents are representatives
of a single insurer or group of insurers who are obligated to
submit business only to that insurer, or at a minimum, give that
insurer first refusal rights on a sale. The term of this
agreement with IPSI will expire in July 2004, but may be
extended if agreed to by both parties. In addition, Assurant
Health has exclusive distribution relationships with United
Services Automobile Association (USAA) and Mutual of Omaha to
market Assurant Health’s individual health products. The
agreement that provides for our arrangement with USAA terminates
in July 2005, but may be extended for a one-year period if
agreed to by both parties. The agreement that provides for our
arrangement with Mutual of Omaha terminates in February 2007 but
may be extended if agreed to by both parties. All of these
arrangements have four-year terms from their commencement dates
and are generally terminable upon our bankruptcy or similar
proceeding or a breach of a material provision by us.
Additionally, some of these arrangements permit termination
after a specified notice period. We also have a solid
relationship with Health Advocates Alliance, the association
through which we provide many of our individual health insurance
products through Assurant Health’s agreement with Health
Advocates Alliance’s administrator National Administration
Company, Inc. The term of this agreement with National
Administration Company will expire in September 2006, but will
be automatically extended for an additional two-year term unless
prior notice of a party’s intent to terminate is given to
the other party. Assurant Health also has had a long-term
relationship



with Rogers Benefit Group, a national marketing
organization with 70 offices. Short-term medical insurance and
student health coverage plans are also sold through the Internet
by Assurant Health and numerous direct writing agents.

Underwriting and Risk Management

Assurant Health’s underwriting and risk
management capabilities include pricing discipline, policy
underwriting, renewal optimization, development and retention of
provider networks and claims processing.

In establishing premium rates for our health care
plans, we use underwriting criteria based upon our accumulated
actuarial data, with adjustments for factors such as claims
experience and member demographics to evaluate anticipated
health care costs. Our pricing considers the expected frequency
and severity of claims and the costs of providing the necessary
coverage, including the cost of administering policy benefits,
sales and other administrative costs. State rate regulation
significantly affects pricing. Our health insurance operations
are subject to a variety of legislative and regulatory
requirements and restrictions covering a range of trade and
claim settlement practices. State insurance regulatory
authorities have broad discretion in approving a health
insurer’s proposed rates. In addition, HIPAA requires
certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance
coverage for individuals and small employer groups and limits
exclusions based on existing conditions.

In our individual health insurance business, we
medically underwrite our applicants and have implemented
programs to improve our underwriting process. These include our
tele-underwriting program, which enables individual insurance
applicants to be interviewed over the telephone by trained
underwriters. Gathering information directly from prospective
clients over the telephone greatly reduces the need for costly
and time-consuming medical exams and physician reports. We
believe this approach leads to lower costs, improved
productivity, faster application processing times and improved
underwriting information. Our individual underwriting considers
not only an applicant’s medical history, but also lifestyle
factors such as avocations and alcohol and drug and tobacco use.
Our individual health insurance products generally permit us to
rescind coverage if an insured has falsified his or her
application.

In our small employer group health insurance
business, we underwrite the group on the basis of demographic
factors such as age, gender, occupation and geographic location
and concentration of the group. In addition, we examine
individual-level medical risk factors for forecasting and
reserving purposes.

Assurant Health offers a broad choice of PPO
network options in each of its markets and enrolls members in
the network that Assurant Health believes reduces our price paid
for health care services while providing high quality care.
Assurant Health enrolls indemnity customers in selected PPO
networks to obtain discounts on provider services that would
otherwise not be available. In situations where a customer does
not obtain services from a contracted provider, Assurant Health
applies various usual and customary fees, which limit the amount
paid to providers within specific geographic areas.

Provider network contracts are a critical
dimension in controlling medical costs since there is often a
significant difference between a network negotiated rate and the
non-discounted rate. To this end, we retain provider networks
through a variety of relationships, which include leased
networks that contract directly with individual health care
providers, proprietary contracts and Private Health Care
Systems, Inc. (PHCS). PHCS is a national private company
that maintains a provider network, which consisted of
approximately 3,700 hospitals and approximately 400,000
physicians as of December 31, 2003. Assurant Health was a
co-founder of PHCS, and as of December 31, 2003 we owned
approximately 25% of the company. PHCS has a staff solely
dedicated to provider relations.

We seek to manage claim costs in our PPO plans by
selecting provider networks that have negotiated favorable
arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care
professionals and requiring participation in our various medical
management programs. In addition, we manage costs through
extensive underwriting, pricing and product design decisions
intended to influence the behavior of our insureds. We provide
case management programs and have doctors, nurses and
pharmacists on staff who endeavor to manage risks related to
medical claims and prescription costs.



We utilize a broad range of focused traditional
cost containment and care management processes across our
various product lines to manage risk and to lower costs. These
include case management, disease management and pharmacy
benefits management programs. Our case management philosophy is
built on helping our insureds confront a complex care system to
find the appropriate care in a timely and cost effective manner.
We believe this approach builds positive relationships with our
providers and insureds and helps us achieve cost savings.

Effective July 1, 2003, Assurant Health
transitioned its pharmacy benefits management function to Medco
Health Solutions, formerly known as Merck-Medco. Medco Health
Solutions has established itself as a leader in its industry
with more than 57,000 participating pharmacies nationwide.
Through Medco Health Solutions’ advanced technology
platforms, Assurant Health is able to access information about
customer utilization patterns on a more timely basis to improve
its risk management capabilities. In addition to the
technology-based advantages, Medco Health Solutions allows us to
purchase our pharmacy benefits at competitive prices. Our
agreement with Medco Health Solutions expires June 30,
2007. Assurant Health also utilizes co-payments and deductibles
to reduce prescription drug costs.

We employ approximately 525 claims employees
in locations throughout the United States dedicated to Assurant
Health. We have an appeals process pursuant to which
policyholders can appeal claims decisions made.

Assurant Employee Benefits

Assurant Employee Benefits, which we began
operating with the acquisition of Mutual Benefit Life Group
Division (now Fortis Benefits Insurance Company) in 1991, is a
market leader in group dental benefit plans sponsored by
employers and funded through payroll deductions based on the
number of master contracts in force. We are also a leading
provider of disability and term life insurance products and
related services to small and medium-sized employers based on
number of master contracts in force.

We focus on employer-sponsored programs for
employers with fewer than 1,000 employees. We are willing to
write programs for employers with more than 1,000 covered
employees when they meet our risk profile. At December 31,
2003, substantially all of our coverages in force and 77% of our
annualized premiums in force were for employers with less than
1,000 employees. We have a particularly strong emphasis on
employers with fewer than 250 employees, which represented
approximately 96% and 59% of our in force coverages and
premiums, respectively, as of December 31, 2003. Our
average in force case size was 57 enrolled employees as of
December 31, 2003.

Trends in the U.S. employment market and, in
particular, in the cost of the medical benefits component of
total compensation, are leading an increasing number of
employers to offer new benefits on a voluntary basis. That is,
after originally vetting the insurer and typically selecting the
particular plan features to be offered, the employer offers the
new benefits to employees at their election and at their cost,
administered through payroll deduction. Because these products
can be economically distributed on this group basis and are
convenient to purchase and maintain, they are appealing to
employees who might have little opportunity or inclination to
purchase similar coverage on an individual basis.

We believe that voluntary products represent a
sizeable growth opportunity. Soliciting employees to enroll in
employer-sponsored health plans requires effective communication
and interaction with the target employee. We have reorganized
our home office and sales operations to reflect the strategic
importance of this area. As part of this reorganization, we have
divided our sales force into those who sell voluntary products
and those who sell “true group” products with each
division collaborating with the other to help meet the needs of
shared brokers and clients. True group products are group
insurance products in which the employer or other group
policyholder pays all or part of the premium on behalf of the
insured members. We are also investing resources in enhanced
enrollment and specialized administrative capabilities for the
voluntary market.



The following table provides net earned premiums
and other considerations, fees and other income and other
operating data for Assurant Employee Benefits for the periods
and as of the dates indicated:

Products and Services

Group Dental.

Dental
benefit plans provide for the funding of necessary or elective
dental care. We provide both employee-paid and employer-paid
plans. Plans may involve a traditional indemnity arrangement, a
PPO arrangement, a “prepaid” arrangement, or some
combination of these programs with employee choice. In a PPO
plan, insureds may select any dental provider, but benefits are
reimbursed at a higher level when they visit a provider who
participates in the PPO. Coverage is subject to deductibles,
coinsurance and annual or lifetime maximums. In a prepaid plan,
members must go to participating dentists in order to receive
benefits. Depending upon the procedure, dental benefits are
provided by participating dentists at either no cost or a
nominal co-payment.



Success in the group dental business requires
strong provider network development and management skills, a
focus on expense management and a claim system capable of
efficiently and accurately adjudicating high volumes of
transactions. We own and operate a PPO, Dental Health Alliance,
L.L.C. We have also developed local managed care networks in
25 states.

In addition to fully insured dental benefits, we
also offer administrative services only (ASO) for
self-funded dental plans. Under these arrangements, the
employers or plan sponsors pay Assurant Employee Benefits a fee
for providing these services. As of December 31, 2003, our
block of this business consisted of approximately 200 groups and
approximately 92,000 covered employees and, for the year ended
December 31, 2003, generated $6.6 million of fee
revenue.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had
approximately 29,300 and 30,300 group dental plans insured or
administered through this segment, respectively, covering or
involving in each case approximately 1.4 million members.

Group Disability
Insurance.

Group disability insurance
provides partial replacement of lost earnings for insured
employees who become disabled and otherwise qualify for
benefits. Our group disability products include both short-term
and long-term disability insurance. Group long-term disability
insurance provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of
income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or
injury. Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or
180 day waiting periods, and benefits are limited to
specified maximums as a percentage of income. Group short-term
disability insurance provides coverage for temporary loss of
income due to injury or sickness, often effective immediately
for accidents and after one week for sickness, also limited to
specified maximums as a percentage of income.

DRMS, our wholly owned subsidiary, provides
insurance carriers that wish to supplement their core product
offerings a turnkey facility with which to write group
disability insurance. Services we provide to the insurers for a
fee include product development, state insurance regulatory
filings, underwriting, claims management or any of the other
functions typically performed by an insurer’s back office.
The risks written by DRMS’ various clients are reinsured
into a pool, with the clients generally retaining shares ranging
from 0% to 50% of the risks they write. As the largest reinsurer
in the pools, our licensed insurance subsidiaries reinsure a
substantial majority of the insurance risk that is ceded by the
client. Since DRMS clients operate in niches not often reached
through our traditional distribution, our participation in the
pools enables us, through a form of alternate distribution, to
reach customers to whom we would not otherwise have access.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had
approximately 37,500 and 39,100 group disability plans in force,
reinsured or administered on an ASO basis, covering
approximately 2.7 million and 3.0 million enrolled
employees, respectively.

Group Term Life
Insurance.

Group term life insurance
is one of the principal means by which working people in the
United States provide for their families against the risk of
premature death and often the means whereby they obtain lesser
amounts of coverage for their spouses, children or domestic
partners. Group term life insurance consists primarily of
renewable term life insurance, which is term life coverage that
is renewable at the option of the insured who is not required to
take a medical examination in order to renew existing amounts of
coverage, with the amount of coverage as a flat amount, an
amount linked to the employees’ earnings, or a combination
of the two. Employers generally provide a base or foundation
level of coverage for their employees and offer the opportunity
for employees to increase their coverage to meet specific needs.
Also, basic term life insurance is often supplemented with an
accidental death or dismemberment policy or rider, which
provides additional benefits in the indicated events. Because
there are few ways to differentiate an insurer in the area of
traditional group term life insurance, we often sell this
product line as a complement to our other core employee benefit
insurance products. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we
had approximately 25,200 and 25,600 group life plans in force,
covering approximately 1.7 million and 2 million
enrolled employees, respectively.



Marketing and Distribution

We distribute the products of Assurant Employee
Benefits primarily through approximately 160 group sales
representatives, located in 40 offices in or near major
U.S. metropolitan areas. These representatives work through
independent employee benefits advisors, including brokers and
other intermediaries, to reach our customers, who are primarily
small to medium-sized employers. DRMS employs an independent
distribution arm tailored to its needs. Our marketing efforts
concentrate on the identification of the employee benefit needs
of our targeted customers, the development of tailored products
and services designed to meet those needs, the alignment of our
Company with select brokers and other intermediaries who value
our approach to the market, and the promotion of our
Company’s brand.

To compete effectively in the small to
medium-sized employer marketplace requires a large and broadly
distributed sales force with relationships with the brokers and
other intermediaries who act as advisors to those employers in
connection with their benefits programs. In many cases, these
employers and their advisors rely on us for expertise in
matching their needs to the collection of solutions available
through group benefit programs. Competing effectively also
requires systems and work practices suited to a high transaction
volume business and the ability to provide a high level of
customer service to a large number of clients operating in
almost all industries found in the U.S. economy.

Underwriting and Risk Management

True group products are normally offered to
employees on a guaranteed issue basis, meaning that if the group
is an acceptable risk, the insurer generally foregoes individual
medical underwriting and agrees in advance to accept all
applications for insurance from members of the eligible class up
to a formula-determined limit. Individual medical underwriting
is required on applications for amounts in excess of this limit,
or in connection with untimely applications. Our sales
representatives and underwriters evaluate the risk
characteristics of each prospective insured group and design
appropriate plans of insurance. They utilize various techniques
such as deductibles, co-payments, guarantee issue limits and
waiting periods to control the risk we assume. Voluntary
products introduce additional risks due to the fact that
employees have some awareness of the risk of loss they
personally face, and those employees who believe themselves to
be more at risk will be more likely to elect coverage. In order
to manage these risks, we customize our plan designs to seek to
mitigate adverse selection problems. We also require that a
minimum percentage of eligible employees elect a voluntary
coverage.

We base the pricing of our products on the
expected pay-out of benefits that we calculate using assumptions
for mortality, morbidity, interest, expenses and persistency,
depending upon the specific product features. Group underwriting
takes into account demographic factors such as age, gender and
occupation of members of the group as well as the geographic
location and concentration of the group. Our disability policies
often limit the payment of benefits for certain kinds of
conditions, such as pre-existing conditions or disabilities
arising from specifically listed medical conditions, in each
case as defined in the policies.

Generally, we are not obligated to accept any
risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of
policies to, any employer or intermediary. Requests for coverage
are reviewed on their merits and generally a policy is not
issued unless the particular risk or group has been examined and
approved by our underwriters. Group products are typically
written with an initial rate guarantee of two years for
disability and life insurance and one year for other group
products. They are also written on a guaranteed renewable basis,
meaning that they are renewable at the option of the insured for
a specified number of years, with the right, upon expiration of
the guarantee, to re-price to reflect the aggregate experience
of our block of business and, where credible, the experience of
the group. Credibility in this context means the assessment of
the likelihood that the past history of the group is predictive
of the future experience of the group. Credibility generally
increases with group size or with the quantity of claims filed.

The business underwritten by our Assurant
Employee Benefits segment is widely dispersed across geographic
areas as well as the industries insured. At December 31,
2003, our top ten states measured by percentage of in force
annual premiums contributed approximately 54.5% of our total
annualized premiums in



force. Similarly, at December 31, 2003, our
top ten industry segments measured by percentage of in force
annual premiums contributed approximately 49.5% of our total
annualized premiums in force.

Our efforts are focused on facilitating
claimants’ return to work through a variety of means,
including physical therapy, vocational rehabilitation and
retraining and workplace accommodation to assist the insured. In
support of this effort, we also employ or contract with a staff
of doctors, nurses and vocational rehabilitation specialists. We
also utilize a broad range of outside medical and vocational
experts for independent evaluations and local vocational
services. Finally, we have an investigations unit focused on
individuals who have or may be capable of returning to work but
continue to claim benefits. Our dental business utilizes a
highly automated claims system focused on rapid handling of
claims, with 69% of claims adjudicated within seven calendar
days for claims received from January 1, 2003 to and
including December 31, 2003.

We employ approximately 800 claims employees in
locations throughout the United States dedicated to the Assurant
Employee Benefits segment. We have a claims review process,
including an appeals process pursuant to which policyholders can
appeal claims decisions made.

Assurant PreNeed

Assurant PreNeed, which we began operating with
the acquisition of United Family Life Insurance Company in 1980,
is the market leader in the United States in pre-funded funeral
insurance based on face amount of new policies sold. Pre-funded
funeral insurance provides whole life insurance death benefits
or annuity benefits used to fund costs incurred in connection
with pre-arranged funerals. An annuity is a contract that
provides for periodic payments to an annuitant for a specified
period of time. In the case of annuities sold by Assurant
PreNeed, all the benefits under the contract are generally paid
out at the death of the purchaser of the annuity. We distribute
our pre-funded funeral insurance products through two separate
channels, our independent channel and our American Memorial Life
Insurance Company (AMLIC) channel. Our pre-funded funeral
insurance products provide benefits to cover the costs incurred
in connection with pre-arranged funeral contracts and are
distributed primarily through funeral homes and sold mainly to
consumers over the age of 65, with an average issue age of 72.
Our pre-funded funeral insurance products are typically
structured as whole life insurance policies in the United States
and as annuity products in Canada. Our independent
channel’s target market is comprised of the 23,000 funeral
firms in the United States and Canada, of which approximately
2,000 are active customers.

With our acquisition of AMLIC in 2000, we have
become the market leader in the area of pre-funded funeral
insurance based on face amount of policies sold. Through our
AMLIC channel, we provide the insurance products and support
services for the pre-need activities of SCI, the largest funeral
provider in North America based on total revenues. As of
December 31, 2003, SCI operated approximately 1,800 funeral
service locations, cemeteries and crematoria in North America.
This commission-based arrangement is anchored by an exclusive
ten-year marketing agreement, which commenced on October 1,
2000.

Growth in pre-need sales has been traditionally
driven by distribution with a high correlation between new sales
of pre-funded funeral insurance and the number of pre-need
counselors marketing the product and expansion in sales and
marketing capabilities. In addition, as alternative distribution
channels are identified, such as targeting affinity groups and
employers, we believe growth in this market could accelerate. We
believe that the pre-need market is characterized by an aging
population combined with low penetration of the over-65 market.

In Assurant PreNeed, our strategy in our
independent channel is to increase sales potential by
strengthening our distribution relationships. We offer marketing
support and programs to our funeral firm clients to increase
their local market share, providing training for their sales
counselors and assisting them in developing direct-to-consumer
marketing programs and lead generation and management tools.
Through our AMLIC channel our strategy is to reduce SCI’s
cost to sell and manage its pre-need operation. We integrate our
processes for managing SCI’s insurance production into its
process for managing its pre-need business. Additionally, in
keeping with our goal of aligning SCI’s interest with ours,
our arrangement with SCI is commission-based; however, we
compensate SCI with an escalating production-based commission,
with a defined maximum.



The following table provides net earned premiums
and other considerations, fees and other income and other
operating data for Assurant PreNeed for the periods and as of
the dates indicated:

Products

Pre-Funded Funeral Insurance
Policies.

Pre-funded funeral insurance
provides whole life insurance death benefits or annuity benefits
to fund the costs incurred in connection with pre-arranged
funeral contracts, or, in a minority of situations, pre-arranged
funerals without a pre-arranged funeral contract, which costs
typically include funeral firm merchandise and services. Our
pre-funded funeral insurance products are typically structured
as whole life insurance policies in the United States. In
Canada, our pre-funded funeral insurance products are typically
structured as annuity contracts for newly issued business. A
pre-arranged funeral contract is an arrangement between a
funeral firm and an individual whereby the funeral firm agrees
to perform the selected funeral upon the individual’s
death. The consumer then purchases an insurance policy intended
to cover the cost of the pre-arranged funeral, and the funeral
home generally becomes the irrevocable assignee, or, in certain
cases, the beneficiary, of the insurance policy proceeds.
However, the insured may name a beneficiary other than the
funeral home. The funeral home agrees to provide the selected
funeral at death in exchange for the policy proceeds. Because
the death benefit under many of our policies is designed to grow
over time, the funeral firm that is the assignee of such a
policy has managed some or all of its funeral inflation risk.
Consumers have the choice of making their policy payments as a
single lump-sum payment or through multi-payment plans that
spread payments out over a period of three to ten years. We do
not provide any funeral goods and services in connection with
our pre-funded funeral insurance policies; these policies pay
death benefits in cash only.

Marketing and Distribution

We distribute our pre-funded funeral insurance
products through two distribution channels: the independent
channel, which distributes through approximately 2,000 funeral
homes and selected third-party general agencies, and our AMLIC
channel, which distributes through an exclusive relationship
with SCI in North America. Our policies are sold by licensed
insurance agents or enrollers who in some cases may also be a
funeral director. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
face amount of our contracts sold through our AMLIC channel
represented approximately 50% and 55%, respectively, of our
total new life and annuity face sales in Assurant PreNeed.



Risk Management

Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life
insurance policies with increasing death benefits and obtains
the majority of its profits through interest rate spreads.
Interest rate spreads refer to the difference between the death
benefit growth rates on pre-funded funeral insurance policies
and the investment returns generated on the assets we hold
related to those policies. To manage these spreads, we monitor
weekly the movement in new money yields and monthly evaluate our
actual net new achievable yields. This information is used to
evaluate rates to be credited on applicable new and in force
pre-funded funeral insurance policies and annuities. In
addition, we review asset benchmarks and perform asset/
liability matching studies to develop the optimum portfolio to
maximize yield and reduce risk.

In Assurant PreNeed, we utilize underwriting to
select and price insurance risks. We regularly monitor mortality
assumptions to determine if experience remains consistent with
these assumptions and to ensure that our product pricing remains
appropriate. We periodically review our underwriting, agent and
policy contract provisions and pricing guidelines so that our
policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing
strategies and profitability goals.

Many of our pre-funded whole-life funeral
insurance policies have increasing death benefits. As of
December 31, 2003, approximately 81% of Assurant
PreNeed’s in force insurance policy reserves relate to
policies that provide for death benefit growth, some of which
provide for minimum death benefit growth pegged to changes in
the Consumer Price Index. Policies that have rates guaranteed to
change with the Consumer Price Index represented approximately
13% of Assurant PreNeed’s reserves as of December 31,
2003. We have employed risk mitigation strategies to seek to
minimize our exposure to a rapid increase in inflation.

In our independent channel, we outsource all of
the servicing and administration of our policies.

Ceded Reinsurance

Our operating business segments utilize ceded
reinsurance for three major business purposes:

•

Loss Protection and Capital
    Management.

As part of our overall
    risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance
    for certain risks underwritten by our various operating business
    segments, including significant individual or catastrophic
    claims, and to free up capital to enable us to write additional
    business.

•

Business
    Dispositions.

We have used reinsurance
    to exit certain businesses, such as our FFG division in 2001 and
    our LTC business in 2000. Reinsurance was used in these cases to
    facilitate the transactions because the businesses shared legal
    entities with business segments that we retained.

•

Assurant Solutions’ Client Risk and
    Profit Sharing.

Assurant Solutions
    writes business produced by its clients, such as mortgage
    lenders and servicers and financial institutions, and reinsures
    all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of
    the clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in
    structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying
    business.

Loss Protection and Capital
    Management

In a traditional indemnity reinsurance
transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for
part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has
issued for an agreed upon premium. These agreements provide for
recovery of a portion of losses and associated loss expenses
from reinsurers. The terms of these agreements, which are
typical for agreements of this type, generally provide, among
other things, for the automatic acceptance by the reinsurer of
ceded risks in excess of our retention limits (i.e. the amount
of loss per individual risk that we are willing to absorb). For
excess of loss coverage, we pay premiums to the reinsurers based
on rates negotiated and stated in the treaties. For pro rata
reinsurance, we pay premiums to the reinsurers based upon
percentages of premiums received by us on the business
reinsured. These agreements are generally terminable as to new
risks by us or by the reinsurer on appropriate notice; however,



termination does not affect risks ceded during
the term of the agreement, which generally remain with the
reinsurer.

We work with our business segments to develop
effective reinsurance arrangements that are consistent with
their pricing and operational goals. For example, Assurant
Employee Benefits cedes 100% of monthly disability claims in
excess of $10,000 per individual insured. For our group
term life business, the maximum amount retained on any one life
is $800,000 of life insurance including accidental death,
limited to $500,000 in life insurance and $300,000 in accidental
death and dismemberment insurance. Amounts in excess of these
figures are reinsured with other life insurance companies on a
yearly renewable term basis. Assurant Solutions purchases
property reinsurance for flood risk, with per property limits of
$925,000 in excess of $75,000 per individual loss. This
treaty has a per occurrence cap of $2,775,000.

For those product lines where there is exposure
to catastrophes (for example, homeowners’ policies written
by Assurant Solutions), we closely monitor and manage our
aggregate risk exposure by geographic area and have entered into
reinsurance treaties to manage our exposure to these types of
events. For 2003, catastrophe reinsurance was purchased to
manage our risk exposure to a hurricane loss in excess of the
modeled 200-year return time loss. We maintain $118 million
of catastrophic excess of loss coverage for fire, flood and
personal liability risks, with a per occurrence retention of the
first $20 million. In addition, 90% of Florida hurricane
losses in excess of $19 million are covered by the Florida
Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF), with coverage capped at
$58 million. This coverage has been in place as of
January 1, 2003 and will continue through May 31,
2004. Future FHCF coverage will be determined by the FHCF in
accordance with Florida statutes and will depend upon Assurant
Solutions’ in force Florida risks and the FHCF claims
paying capacity. Also, in Assurant Employee Benefits, we have
purchased catastrophic reinsurance coverage in the group term
life product line of $30 million in excess of our retention
of the first $20 million.

A significant portion of Assurant Health’s
business has been reinsured under non-proportional reinsurance
agreements that provide for the reinsurers to indemnify us for
losses in a calendar year on combined ratios up to but not
exceeding 110%. Such losses, with interest, are offset against
any future profits. For calendar years where the combined ratio
does not exceed 98%, Assurant Health keeps all the profits on
the reinsured business net of the reinsurance fee. For years
where the reinsured business is profitable but the combined
ratio exceeds 98%, Assurant Health keeps 50% of the profits on
the business net of the fee.

With the exception of a small block of older
policy forms, all of the LTC business of John Alden, one of our
subsidiaries, has been reinsured with ERC Life Reinsurance
Corporation (ERC). All risks and profits generated by the
reinsured business have been transferred to ERC. The reserves
and premium transferred are in excess of 95% of the direct
long-term care amounts generated by John Alden. The remaining
small block of long-term care policies in John Alden has been
reinsured with John Hancock as part of the sale of that
division. See “— Business Dispositions”
below.

Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which
we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if
the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit
this risk, we have control procedures in place to evaluate the
financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the
concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The
selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related
to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser degree,
diversification as well as on developing strong relationships
with our reinsurers for the sharing of risks.

In addition, we also purchase reinsurance when
capital requirements and the economic terms of the reinsurance
make it appropriate to do so.

Business Dispositions

We have exited businesses through reinsurance
ceded to third parties, such as our 2001 sale of the insurance
operations of FFG to The Hartford. The assets backing the
liabilities on these businesses are held in a trust. All
separate account business and John Alden general account
business relating to FFG were transferred through modified
coinsurance, a form of proportional reinsurance in which the
underlying assets and liabilities are still reflected on the
ceding company’s balance sheet. Under this arrangement, The
Hartford



receives all premiums, pays all claims and funds
all reserve increases net of investment income on reserves held.
All other FFG business was reinsured by 100% coinsurance, which
transfers all affected assets and liabilities as well as all
premiums and claims to the assuming company. We would be
responsible for administering this business in the event of a
default by The Hartford.

In 1997, John Alden sold substantially all of its
annuity operations to SunAmerica Life Insurance Company
(SunAmerica), now a subsidiary of American International
Group, Inc. In connection with the sale, John Alden
reinsured its existing block of annuity policies to SunAmerica
on a coinsurance basis. This coinsurance was initially on an
indemnity basis and the parties agreed to transition the
business to an assumption basis as soon as practical. An
assumption basis is a form of reinsurance under which policy
administration and the contractual relationship with the
insured, as well as liabilities, pass to the reinsurer. In
certain states, the transition to an assumption basis is subject
to policyholder approval. To the extent that such transition
does not take place with respect to any particular policy, the
policy will remain reinsured on an indemnity basis. As of
December 31, 2003, more than 95% of the ceded annuity
reserves had either transitioned to an assumption basis or had
lapsed.

In 2000, we sold all of our LTC operations to
John Hancock. In connection with the sale, we reinsured our
existing block of long-term care policies to John Hancock on a
coinsurance basis. Under the coinsurance agreement, we
transferred 100% of the policy reserves and related assets on
this block of business to John Hancock, and John Hancock agreed
to be responsible for 100% of the policy benefits. The assets
backing the liabilities on this business are held in a trust and
John Hancock is obligated to fund the trust if the value of the
assets is deemed insufficient to fund the liabilities. If John
Hancock fails to fulfill these obligations, we will be obligated
to make these payments.

Assurant Solutions’ Client Risk and
    Profit Sharing

Historically, our insurance subsidiaries in
Assurant Solutions have ceded a portion of the premiums and risk
related to business generated by certain clients to the
client’s captive insurance companies or to reinsurance
companies in which the clients have an ownership interest. In
some cases, our insurance subsidiaries have assumed a portion of
these ceded premiums and risk from the captive insurance
companies and reinsurance companies. Through these arrangements,
our insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk
related to client-generated business with these clients. When
the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in
our insurance subsidiary’s domiciliary state, our insurance
subsidiary generally obtains collateral, such as a trust or a
letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate
in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full
financial credit in the domiciliary state for the third-party
reinsurance. See “Item 7A — Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Credit
Risk.”

In addition, we have received and responded to a
John Doe summons from the Internal Revenue Service requesting
information as to the identities of U.S. taxpayers that
have engaged in producer-owned reinsurance company transactions
in the Turks and Caicos with us. The Internal Revenue Service
previously issued a notice stating that certain tax benefits
claimed in connection with producer-owned reinsurance company
transactions involving credit insurance transactions with
producers who own reinsurance companies located in the Turks and
Caicos will be denied and is investigating whether tax benefits
claimed by the taxpayers they wish to identify are available.
This summons states that there is no issue in the investigation
relating to our tax liability. However, it is possible that the
investigation by the Internal Revenue Service could affect our
current reinsurance arrangements.



Gross
Annualized Premium in Force, Ceded Portion and Net Amount
Retained

The following table details our gross annualized
premium in force, the portion that was ceded to reinsurers and
the net amount that was retained as of December 31, 2003.

(1)

Gross includes direct plus assumed premiums.

Claims Provisions/ Reserves

In accordance with industry and accounting
practices and applicable insurance laws and regulatory
requirements, we establish reserves for payment of claims and
claims expenses for claims that arise from our insurance
policies. We maintain reserves for future policy benefits and
unpaid claims expenses. Policy reserves represent the
accumulation of the premiums received that are set aside to
provide for future benefits and expenses on claims not yet
incurred. Claim reserves are established for future payments and
associated expenses not yet due on claims that have already been
incurred, whether reported to us or not. Reserves do not
represent an exact calculation of future policy benefits and
expenses but are instead estimates made by us using actuarial
and statistical procedures. There can be no assurance that any
such reserves would be sufficient to fund our future liabilities
in all circumstances. Future loss development could require
reserves to be increased, which would adversely affect earnings
in current and/or future periods. Adjustments to reserve amounts
may be required in the event of changes from the assumptions
regarding future morbidity, the incidence of disability claims
and the rate of recovery, including the effects thereon of
inflation and other societal and economic factors, persistency,
mortality, property claim frequency and severity and the
interest rates used in calculating the reserve amounts. The
reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements are
calculated in accordance with GAAP.

See “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting
Policies — Reserves.”

Reserves are regularly reviewed and updated,
using the most current information. Any adjustments are
reflected in the current results of operations. However, because
the establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain
process, there can be no assurance that ultimate losses will not
exceed existing reserves.

Reserves are reviewed at least quarterly by our
business segment management.

Investments

The investment portfolio is a critical part of
our business activities and important to our overall
profitability. The fundamental investment philosophy is to
manage assets, within our stated risk parameters, to generate
consistent and high levels of investment income, before gains
and losses, while providing a total return that is competitive
over the long-term. Our investment team is charged with:
maintaining safety of principal and sufficient liquidity;
managing credit, interest rate, prepayment and market risks;
maintaining adequate diversification among asset classes,
industry concentrations and individual issuers; and adhering to
all applicable regulatory requirements.

We have individual business segments with
different needs and characteristics. Hence, our investment
approach for each business segment is tailored to that business
segment’s needs in terms of asset allocation, liquidity
needs and duration of assets and liabilities.



Organization

The general account is managed by our asset
management department, Assurant Asset Management, or AAM. In
this capacity, AAM acts as both our investment advisor and our
asset manager. As investment advisor, the AAM organization
oversees the design and implementation of overall investment
policy. As asset manager, AAM is responsible for
(i) directly investing those general account assets for
which the department has in-house expertise and
(ii) selecting and monitoring outside managers for those
assets for which AAM has limited expertise. AAM fulfills these
roles through its involvement in the establishment of risk
management techniques, business segment investment policy and
asset benchmark construction and through leadership and
participation in our two investment oversight entities: the
Company’s risk management committee and the individual
business segment investment committees.

Investment
Process

Our investment process is initiated by the
strategic analysis group within AAM. This group designs an
appropriate asset allocation benchmark for each portfolio that
is tailored to the associated liabilities and is designed to
generate the highest level of investment income available given
each business segment’s overall risk tolerance. Although
income is the primary objective, total return is a significant
secondary objective. We operate our business through multiple
legal entities. At least one portfolio is maintained for each
legal entity. In addition, separate portfolios are maintained
for legal entities that conduct business for more than one
business segment. The maturities of the assets are selected so
as to satisfy a duration corridor for each portfolio that is
appropriate to its underlying liabilities. Duration is the
sensitivity of the portfolio to movements of interest rates. The
actual duration is dynamic and will change with time and
interest rate movement, as will the liability duration. The
duration corridor is chosen by analyzing various risk/reward
measures from appropriate asset/liability studies. The duration
of our portfolio as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 5.92
and 5.41 years, respectively. This represents the
amalgamated duration of our four operating business segments
that is directly tied to their liabilities, many of which are
short-tail. It is our intent to manage the portfolios such that
their durations closely match the liabilities that they support.

In addition, the asset allocation benchmark will
reflect multiple constraints, such as all risk tolerances
established by our risk management committee, appropriate credit
structure, prepayment risk tolerance, liquidity requirements,
capital efficiency, tax considerations and regulatory and rating
agency requirements. The individual benchmarks are then
aggregated together to give a total asset profile. Asset
management is conducted at the portfolio level; however, risk
constraints are also in place for the aggregate portfolio. Each
benchmark is reviewed at least annually for appropriateness.

Our investment portfolios are invested in the
following key asset classes: fixed income securities, including
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities; preferred
stocks; commercial mortgage loans; and commercial real estate.
We began investing in private placement loans in the fourth
quarter of 2003 and ultimately over the next several years
intend to have private placement loans represent 5% of our total
invested assets. As of December 31, 2003, we had
approximately $19 million invested in private placements.
We do not currently invest new money in equity securities;
however, we may do so in the future. As of December 31,
2003, less than 1% of the fair value of our total invested
assets was invested in common stock.

Fixed Income
Portfolio Process

AAM controls the credit risk in the fixed income
portfolio through a combination of issuer level credit research
and portfolio level credit risk management. At the issuer level,
we maintain a credit database that contains both qualitative and
quantitative assessments of over 200 issuers and 35 industries.
At the portfolio level, we control credit risk primarily through
quality and industry diversification, individual issuer limits
based upon credit rating and a sell discipline designed to
reduce quickly exposure to deteriorating credits. In addition,
we monitor changes in individual security values on a
semi-monthly basis in order to identify potential problem
credits. This process is also incorporated into our impairment
watchlist process. The risks in the fixed income portfolio are
controlled and monitored.



In order to invest in a wide variety of asset
classes in our portfolio and to appropriately manage the
accompanying risks, we had outsourced the management of almost
14% of our portfolio’s market value as of December 31,
2003. We have engaged Alliance Capital Management Corp. and
Wellington Management Co. for high yield investments, Spectrum
Asset Management, Inc. and Flaherty & Crumrine
Inc. for preferred stock investments, Prudential Private
Placement Investors, LP for our private placements and Lancaster
Investment Counsel and Phillips Hager & North
Investment Management Ltd. for our Canadian investment
portfolios.

Commercial
Mortgage Loans Investment Process

We originate fixed rate, first commercial
mortgage loans through a nationwide group of exclusive, regional
mortgage correspondents. We have a mortgage loan committee
within AAM that is responsible for the approval of our mortgage
loan related investments. Generally the mortgage correspondents
service the loans they originate and we regularly meet with them
to help foster a strong working relationship. We are a portfolio
lender and generally hold our commercial mortgage loans to
maturity. We typically do not securitize or otherwise sell our
commercial mortgage loans.

A potential loss reserve based on historical data
adjusted for current expectations is maintained and is typically
between 1.25% and 2.25% of commercial mortgage loans on real
estate. As of December 31, 2003, the reserve was
approximately 2.0% of the unpaid principal of our commercial
mortgage loans, or $19 million.

Investment
Real Estate Process

We invest in income-producing commercial
properties to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns as well
as to generate operating investment income with the potential
for capital gains upon sale of the property. We invest with
regional operating partners who generally invest capital in the
property with us and provide management and leasing services.
Our portfolio is diversified by location, property type,
operating partner and lease term. Property types include office
buildings, warehouse/industrial buildings and multi-family
housing.

Portfolio
Composition

Our total invested assets were
$10,924 million and $10,084 million, or 46% and 45%,
of our total assets, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Our net investment income for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 9% and 10%, respectively, of
our total revenue, excluding realized investment losses and
gains. We had a net realized gain on investments of
$2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and a
net realized loss on investments of $118 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, fixed
maturity securities accounted for 80% of our total invested
assets. The corporate bond portfolio is well diversified across
industry classes.

The following table sets forth the carrying value
of the securities held in our investment portfolio at the dates
indicated:



Investment
Results

The overall income yield on our investments after
investment expenses, excluding net realized investment gains
(losses), was 5.61% for the year ended December 31, 2003
and 6.20% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The overall
income yield on our investments after investment expenses,
including realized gains (losses), was 5.63% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 and 5.04% for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

The following table sets forth the income yield
and net investment income, excluding realized investment
gains/(losses), for each major investment category for the
periods indicated.

(1)

The yield is calculated by dividing income by
    average assets. The yield calculation for the year ended
    December 31, 2003 includes the average of asset positions
    as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003. The
    yield calculation for the year ended December 31, 2002
    includes the average of asset positions as of December 31,
    2001 and December 31, 2002.

(2)

Total return is calculated using beginning and
    ending market portfolio value adjusted for external cash flows.

(3)

The actual portfolio is customized for the
    liabilities that it supports. It will therefore differ from the
    Lehman Index, both in asset allocation and duration. As of
    December 31, 2003, the actual portfolio had a duration of
    5.96 years with 4% of the total portfolio in
    U.S. Government securities, 59% in U.S. credit and 16%
    in securitized assets. Commercial mortgages and real estate
    comprised the remainder of the portfolio. In contrast, the
    Lehman Index had a duration of 4.54 with 34% in
    U.S. Government securities, 26% in U.S. credit and 40%
    in securitized assets.



Fixed Maturity
Securities

The amortized cost and fair value of fixed
maturity securities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, by type
of issuer, were as follows:

For similar information regarding our equity
securities, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

The following table presents our fixed maturity
securities portfolio by NAIC designation and the equivalent
ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating
organizations as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, as well as
the percentage based on fair value, that each designation
comprises:



The amortized cost and fair value of fixed
maturity securities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, by
contractual maturity are shown below:

Virtually all of our fixed maturity securities
portfolio is publicly traded. We have recently initiated a
private placement program and plan to invest approximately
$500 million in privately placed securities over the next
two years. Currently, we have less than 1% of our fixed maturity
securities invested in private placement. As of
December 31, 2003, approximately 95% of the fair market
value of our fixed maturity securities were dollar denominated.
As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $564
(Canadian) million invested in Canadian fixed maturity
securities; however, these assets directly support Canadian
liabilities.

Commercial
Mortgage Loans

We have made commercial mortgage loans,
collateralized by the underlying real estate, on properties
located throughout the United States. At December 31, 2003
approximately 34% of the outstanding principal balance of
commercial mortgage loans was concentrated in the states of
California, New York, and Pennslyvania. Although we have a
diversified loan portfolio, an economic downturn could have an
adverse impact on the ability of our debtors to repay their
loans.

Investment
Real Estate

We also hold commercial equity real estate as
part of our investment portfolio. Investments in real estate
joint ventures totaled $57 million and $63 million as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We own real
estate through real estate joint ventures and partnerships. The
main property types within our portfolio are office,
industrial/warehouse and multi-family housing.

Competition

We face competition in each of our businesses;
however, we believe that no single competitor competes against
us in all of our business lines and the business lines in which
we operate are generally characterized by a limited number of
competitors. Competition in our operating business segments is
based on a number of factors, including: quality of service,
product features, price, scope of distribution, financial
strength ratings and name recognition.

The relative importance of these factors depends
on the particular product and market. We compete for customers
and distributors with insurance companies and other financial
services companies in our various businesses.

Assurant Solutions has numerous competitors in
its product lines, but we believe no other company participates
in all of the same lines or offers comprehensive capabilities.
Competitors include insurance companies and financial
institutions. In Assurant Health, we believe the market is
characterized by many competitors, and our main competitors
include health insurance companies and the Blue Cross/ Blue
Shield plans in the states in which we write business. In
Assurant Employee Benefits, commercial competitors include other
life insurance companies as well as not-for-profit Delta Dental
plans. In Assurant PreNeed, our



main competitors are two pre-need life insurance
companies with nationwide representation, Forethought Financial
Services and Homesteaders Life Company, and several small
regional insurers. While we are among the largest competitors in
terms of market share in many of our business lines, in some
cases there are one or more major market players in a particular
line of business.

Some of these companies may offer more
competitive pricing, greater diversity of distribution, better
brand recognition or higher financial strength ratings than we
have. Some may also have greater financial resources with which
to compete. In addition, many of our insurance products,
particularly our group benefits and health insurance policies,
are underwritten annually and, accordingly, there is a risk that
group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from
competitors rather than renewing coverage with us. The effect of
competition may, as a result, adversely affect the persistency
of these and other products, as well as our ability to sell
products in the future.

Ratings

Rating organizations continually review the
financial positions of insurers, including our insurance
subsidiaries. Insurance companies are assigned financial
strength ratings by independent rating agencies based upon
factors relevant to policyholders. Ratings provide both industry
participants and insurance consumers meaningful information on
specific insurance companies and are an important factor in
establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.
All of our active domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are
rated by A.M. Best. A.M. Best maintains a letter scale
rating system ranging from “A++” (Superior) to
“S” (Suspended). Six of our domestic operating
insurance subsidiaries are also rated by Moody’s. In
addition, seven of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries
are rated by S&P and Fitch.

Most of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries have A.M. Best financial strength ratings of A
(“Excellent”), which is the second highest of ten
ratings categories and the highest within the category based on
modifiers (i.e., A and A- are “Excellent”). Our other
domestic operating insurance subsidiaries have A.M. Best
financial strength ratings of A- (“Excellent”), which
is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the lowest
within the category based on modifiers.

The Moody’s financial strength rating for
one of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries is A2
(“Good”), which is the third highest of nine ratings
categories and mid-range within the category based on modifiers
(i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are “Good”), and for five of our
domestic operating insurance subsidiaries is A3
(“Good”), which is the third highest of nine ratings
categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers.

The S&P financial strength rating for five of
our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries is
A (“Strong”), which is the third highest of nine
ratings categories and mid-range within the category based on
modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A- are “Strong”), and
for two of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries is
A- (“Strong”), which is the third highest of nine
ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on
modifiers.

The Fitch financial strength rating for the seven
rated domestic insurance companies is A (“Strong”),
which is the third highest of twelve rating categories and
mid-range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A ,
and A- are “Strong”).

The objective of A.M. Best’s, Moody’s,
S&P’s, and Fitch’s ratings systems is to assist
policyholders and to provide an opinion of an insurer’s
financial strength, operating performance, strategic position
and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders.
These ratings reflect the opinions of A.M. Best, Moody’s,
S&P and Fitch of our ability to pay policyholder claims, are
not applicable to our common stock or debt securities and are
not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security,
including our common stock or debt securities. These ratings are
subject to periodic review by and may be revised upward,
downward or revoked at the sole discretion of A.M. Best,
Moody’s, S&P and Fitch.



REGULATION

United States

State Regulation

General

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to
regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they
transact business. The extent of regulation varies, but
generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory,
supervisory and administrative authority to a department of
insurance in each state. The regulation, supervision and
administration relate, among other things, to: standards of
solvency that must be met and maintained, the payment of
dividends, changes of control of insurance companies, the
licensing of insurers and their agents, the types of insurance
that may be written, guaranty funds, privacy practices, the
ability to enter and exit certain insurance markets, the nature
of and limitations on investments, premium rates, restrictions
on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy,
reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other
obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders, payment of sales compensation to third parties,
approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct,
including underwriting and claims practices.

State insurance departments also conduct periodic
examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require
the filing of annual and other reports, prepared under SAP
(Statutory Accounting Principles), relating to the financial
condition of companies and other matters. Financial examinations
completed during the past three years with respect to our
operating subsidiaries have not resulted in material negative
adjustments to statutory surplus and pending financial and
market conduct examinations with respect to these subsidiaries
have not identified any material findings to date. Two of our
subsidiaries have responded affirmatively to an NAIC survey
regarding race-based premiums, resulting in examinations by two
state insurance departments. This relates to actions of the
subsidiaries or predecessor companies before acquisition by us.
One examination has been concluded and one is still in progress
and, to date, no penalties have been imposed as a result of
these examinations. The amount of in force business as to which
these subsidiaries charged race-based premiums is very small,
representing less than 1% of the in force block of business of
the Company at December 31, 2003. While we do not expect
that these examinations will have a material adverse effect on
us, there can be no assurance that further examinations or
litigation will not occur with respect to race-based premiums.

In February 2003, two of our subsidiaries,
American Bankers Insurance Company (ABIC) and American
Bankers Life Assurance Company (ABLAC), reached a final
settlement with the State of Minnesota in connection with
certain alleged regulatory violations. Pursuant to the
settlement, ABIC and ABLAC have agreed to stop selling insurance
in Minnesota for five years, though they could apply for
reinstatement in 20 months. In addition, ABIC may lose its
license to conduct business in the State of Minnesota as a
result of alleged violations of the Minnesota Fair Campaign
Practices Act. However, other member companies of Assurant
Solutions with product lines that overlap with those offered by
ABIC and ABLAC currently remain authorized to conduct business
in the State of Minnesota. See “Item 3 —
Legal Proceedings.”

In addition, we are currently engaged in
litigation with the Department of Commerce (which regulates
insurance) in the State of Minnesota in which we are seeking to
enforce an existing consent order allowing us to implement rate
increases for our individual medical business in Minnesota.

At the present time, our insurance subsidiaries
are collectively licensed to transact business in all
50 states and the District of Columbia, although several of
our insurance subsidiaries or prepaid dental plan companies
individually are licensed in only one or a few states. We have
insurance subsidiaries or prepaid dental plan companies
domiciled in the states of Alabama, Arizona, California,
Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska,
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah,
Wisconsin, and in Puerto Rico.



Regulation of Credit Insurance
    Products

Most states and other jurisdictions in which our
insurance subsidiaries do business have enacted laws and
regulations that apply specifically to consumer credit
insurance. The methods of regulation vary but generally relate
to, among other things, the amount and term of coverage, the
content of required disclosures to debtors, the filing and
approval of policy forms and rates, the ability to provide
creditor-placed insurance and limitations on the amount of
premiums that may be charged and on the amount of compensation
that may be paid as a percentage of premiums. In addition, some
jurisdictions have enacted or are considering regulations that
may limit profitability arising from credit insurance based on
underwriting experience.

The regulation of credit insurance is also
affected by judicial activity. For example, recent federal court
decisions have enhanced the ability of national banks to engage
in activities that effectively compete with our consumer credit
insurance business without being subject to various aspects of
state insurance regulation.

Regulation of Service Contracts and
    Warranties

The extent of regulation over the sale of service
contracts and warranties varies considerably from state to
state. In the states that do regulate the sales of these
products, the regulations generally are less stringent than
those applicable to the sale of insurance. For example, most
states do not require the filing and approval of contract forms
and rates for service contracts and warranties. States that do
regulate such contract forms typically require specific wording
regarding cancellation rights and regarding the consumer’s
rights in the event of a claim. Most states do not require that
individual salespersons of service contracts and warranties be
licensed as insurance agents. In the states that do require such
a license, salespersons may qualify for a limited license to
sell service contracts and warranties without meeting the
education and examination requirements applicable to insurance
agents. In addition, the compensation paid to salespersons of
service contracts and warranties is generally not regulated.

Regulation of Health Insurance
    Products

State regulation of health insurance products
varies from state to state, although all states regulate premium
rates, policy forms and underwriting and claims practices to one
degree or another. Most states have special rules for health
insurance sold to individuals and small groups. For example, a
number of states have passed or are considering legislation that
would limit the differentials in rates that insurers could
charge for health care coverages between new business and
renewal business for small groups with similar demographics.
Every state has also adopted legislation that would make health
insurance available to all small employer groups by requiring
coverage of all employees and their dependents, by limiting the
applicability of pre-existing conditions exclusions, by
requiring insurers to offer a basic plan exempt from certain
benefits as well as a standard plan, or by establishing a
mechanism to spread the risk of high risk employees to all small
group insurers. The U.S. Congress and various state
legislators have from time to time proposed changes to the
health care system that could affect the relationship between
health insurers and their customers, including external review.
In addition, various states are considering the adoption of
“play or pay” laws requiring that employers either
offer health insurance or pay a tax to cover the costs of public
health care insurance. We cannot predict with certainty the
effect that any proposals, if adopted, or legislative
developments could have on our insurance businesses and
operations.

A number of states have enacted new health
insurance legislation over the past several years. These laws,
among other things, mandate benefits with respect to certain
diseases or medical procedures, require health insurers to offer
an independent external review of certain coverage decisions and
establish health insurer liability. There has also been an
increase in legislation regarding, among other things, prompt
payment of claims, privacy of personal health information,
health insurer liability and relationships between health
insurers and providers. We expect that this trend of increased
legislation will continue. These laws may have the effect of
increasing our costs and expenses.

In most states in which we operate, we provide
our individual health insurance products through an association.
The use of associations offers greater flexibility on pricing,
underwriting and product design compared to products sold
directly to individuals on a true individual policy basis due to
the greater regulatory



scrutiny of true individual policies. The
marketing of health insurance through association groups has
recently come under increased scrutiny. An interruption in, or
changes to, our relationships with various third-party
distributors or our inability to respond to regulatory changes
could impair our ability to compete and market our insurance
products and services and materially adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

Regulation of Employee Benefits
    Products

State regulation of non-medical group products,
including group term life insurance, group disability and group
dental products, also varies from state to state. As with
individual insurance products, the regulation of these products
generally also includes oversight over premium rates and policy
forms, but often to a lesser degree. The regulatory environment
for group term life insurance is relatively established, with
few significant changes from year to year.

Group PPO dental insurance policies are generally
regulated in the same manner as non-PPO dental policies, except
to the extent that a small number of states have chosen to
restrict the difference in benefits allowable between in-network
and out-of-network services. Also, some states directly regulate
the operation of the PPO network by requiring separate licensing
or registration for the organization that contracts with the
providers of dental care. In those states, PPOs also must comply
with varying levels of regulatory oversight concerning the
content of PPO contracts and provider practice standards. Most
of the states in which prepaid dental plans are written
recognize prepaid dental plans as an activity separate from
traditional insurance, because providers are compensated through
capitation arrangements. In most of these states, prepaid dental
plans are written by a single-purpose, single-state affiliate
that holds a license distinct from the life and health insurance
license required for group dental insurance policies. Entities
providing prepaid plans are variously licensed as health
maintenance organizations (HMOs), prepaid dental plans, limited
service health plans, life and health insurers or risk-bearing
PPOs, where such licenses are required. Each state has different
rules regarding organization, capitalization and reporting for
the separate entities, with additional variations relating to
provider contracting, oversight, plan management and plan
operations.

Providers of group disability and dental
insurance, like providers of group health insurance, are subject
to state privacy laws, claims processing rules and “prompt
pay” requirements in various states.

As an extension of past legislative activities in
the medical insurance arena, legislative and regulatory
consideration, at both the federal and state levels, is being
directed toward an effort to mandate what its proponents call
“mental health parity” in the policy provisions of
group disability insurance plans. This would require providers
of group disability insurance to extend the same benefits for
disabilities related to mental illness as are provided for other
disabilities.

Group benefit plans and the claims thereunder are
also largely subject to federal regulation under ERISA, a
complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation
and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the
Department of Labor. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the
relationships between us and employers who maintain employee
benefit plans subject to ERISA. Some of our administrative
services and other activities may also be subject to regulation
under ERISA.

Regulation of Pre-Funded Funeral Insurance
    Products

State regulation of the pre-funded funeral
insurance products business varies considerably from state to
state. Our pre-funded funeral insurance products are typically
structured as small whole life insurance policies, usually under
$10,000 face amount, and are regulated as such by the states.
State laws also restrict who may sell a pre-funded funeral. For
example, in certain states a pre-funded funeral may only be
offered through licensed funeral directors. In New York,
the payment of commissions to a funeral director for the sale of
insurance is prohibited.

State privacy laws, particularly those with
“opt-in” clauses, can also affect the pre-funded
funeral insurance business. These laws make it harder to share
information for marketing purposes, such as generating new sales
leads. Similarly, state “do not call” lists, as well
as the recently created national “do not call” list,



also make it more difficult for our pre-funded
funeral insurance agents to solicit new customers, particularly
on a cold call basis.

In certain states, insurance companies offering
pre-funded funeral insurance products must offer a
“free-look period” of typically 30 days, during
which the purchaser of the product may cancel and receive a full
refund. Furthermore, in certain states, death benefits under
pre-funded funeral insurance products must grow with the
Consumer Price Index.

Insurance Holding Company Statutes

Although as a holding company,
Assurant, Inc. is not regulated as an insurance company, we
own capital stock in insurance subsidiaries and therefore are
subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well as
certain other laws, of each of the states of domicile of our
insurance subsidiaries. All holding company statutes, as well as
other laws, require disclosure and, in some instances, prior
approval of material transactions between an insurance company
and an affiliate. The holding company statutes as well as other
laws also require, among other things, prior approval of an
acquisition of control of a domestic insurer, some transactions
between affiliates and the payment of extraordinary dividends or
distributions.

Insurance Regulation Concerning
    Dividends

The payment of dividends to us by any of our
insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e.,
extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the
subsidiary’s domiciliary state department of insurance.
Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is
generally required, are limited to amounts determined by
formula, which varies by state. The formula for more than half
of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is the
greater of (i) 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end
of the prior year or (ii) the prior year’s statutory
net income. In the remaining states in which our subsidiaries
are domiciled, the formula is the lesser amount of
clauses (i) and (ii). Some states, however, have an
additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of
earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment
of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance
subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing
agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be
adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block
such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior
approval. As part of the regulatory approval process for the
acquisition of ABIG in 1999, we entered into an agreement with
the Florida Insurance Department pursuant to which ABIC and
ABLAC have agreed to limit the amount of ordinary dividends they
would pay to us to an amount no greater than 50% of the amount
otherwise permitted under Florida law. This agreement expires in
August 2004. In addition, we entered into an agreement with the
New York Insurance Department as part of the regulatory
approval process for the merger of Bankers American Life
Assurance Company, one of our New York-domiciled insurance
subsidiaries, into First Fortis Life Insurance Company in 2001
pursuant to which First Fortis Life Insurance Company agreed not
to pay any dividends to us until fiscal year 2004. No assurance
can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions
restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay
dividends. Based on the dividend restrictions under applicable
laws and regulations, the maximum amount of dividends that our
subsidiaries could pay to us in 2003 without regulatory approval
was approximately $290 million, of which approximately
$99.5 million had been paid as of December 31, 2003.

Statutory Accounting Practices (SAP)

SAP is a basis of accounting developed to assist
insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency
of insurance companies. It is primarily concerned with measuring
an insurer’s statutory surplus. Accordingly, statutory
accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers
at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate
insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each
insurer’s domiciliary state.

GAAP is concerned with a company’s solvency,
but it is also concerned with other financial measurements, such
as income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more
consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses
and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than
does SAP. As a direct



result, different assets and liabilities and
different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as opposed
to SAP.

Statutory accounting practices established by the
NAIC and adopted, for the most part, by the various state
insurance regulators determine, among other things, the amount
of statutory surplus and statutory net income of our insurance
subsidiaries and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds
they have available to pay as dividends to us.

Assessments for Guaranty Funds

Virtually all states require insurers licensed to
do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss
suffered by some insureds as a result of the insolvency of other
insurers. Depending upon state law, insurers can be assessed an
amount that is generally equal to between 1% and 3% of premiums
written for the relevant lines of insurance in that state each
year to pay the claims of an insolvent insurer. A portion of
these payments is recoverable through premium rates, premium tax
credits or policy surcharges. Significant increases in
assessments could limit the ability of our insurance
subsidiaries to recover such assessments through tax credits or
other means. In addition, there have been some legislative
efforts to limit or repeal the tax offset provisions, which
efforts, to date, have been generally unsuccessful. These
assessments are expected to increase in the future as a result
of recent insolvencies.

Insurance Regulations Concerning Change of
    Control

Many state insurance regulatory laws intended
primarily for the protection of policyholders contain provisions
that require advance approval by the state insurance
commissioner of any change in control of an insurance company
that is domiciled, or, in some cases, having such substantial
business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that
state. Prior to granting such approval, the state insurance
commissioner will consider such factors as the financial
strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant’s
board of directors and executive officers, the applicant’s
plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any
anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of
the acquisition of control. We own, directly or indirectly, all
of the shares of stock of insurance companies domiciled in the
states listed in the “General” section above.
“Control” is generally presumed to exist through the
ownership of 10% (5% in the case of Florida, in which certain of
our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled) or more of the voting
securities of a domestic insurance company or of any company
that controls a domestic insurance company. Any purchaser of
shares of common stock representing 10% (5% in the
case of Florida) or more of the voting power of our capital
stock will be presumed to have acquired control of our domestic
insurance subsidiaries unless, following application by that
purchaser in each insurance subsidiary’s state of domicile,
the relevant insurance commissioner determines otherwise.

In addition to these filings, the laws of many
states contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state
agencies prior to any change in control of a non-domestic
insurance company admitted to transact business in that state.
While these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state
agency to disapprove the change of control, they do authorize
issuance of cease and desist orders with respect to the
non-domestic insurer if it is determined that some conditions,
such as undue market concentration, would result from the
acquisition.

Any future transactions that would constitute a
change in control of any of our insurance subsidiaries would
generally require prior approval by the insurance departments of
the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or
commercially domiciled and may require pre-acquisition
notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition
notification provisions and in which such insurance subsidiaries
are admitted to transact business. Regulatory approval for a
change of control may also be required in one or more of the
foreign jurisdictions in which we have insurance subsidiaries.

These requirements may deter, delay or prevent
transactions affecting the control of our common stock,
including transactions that could be advantageous to our
stockholders.



Insurance Regulatory Information
    System

The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System
(IRIS) was developed to help state regulators identify
companies that may require special attention. The IRIS system
consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby
financial examiners review annual statements and financial
ratios. The statistical phase consists of 12 key financial
ratios based on year-end data that are generated from the NAIC
database annually; each ratio has an established “usual
range” of results. These ratios assist state insurance
departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the
financial condition of insurance companies.

A ratio result falling outside the usual range of
IRIS ratios is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual
values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring
system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for
financially sound companies to have several ratios with results
outside the usual ranges. Generally, an insurance company will
become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the
usual ranges of four or more of the ratios. In the past,
variances in certain ratios of our insurance subsidiaries have
resulted in inquiries from insurance departments, to which we
have responded. These inquiries have not led to any restrictions
affecting our operations.

Risk-Based
Capital (RBC) Requirements

In order to enhance the regulation of insurer
solvency, the NAIC has adopted formulas and model laws to
implement RBC requirements for life and health insurers, for
property and casualty insurers, and, most recently, for health
organizations. These formulas and model laws are designed to
determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of
protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder
obligations.

Under laws adopted by individual states, insurers
having less total adjusted capital generally, as defined by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), than
that required by the relevant RBC formula will be subject to
varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of
capital inadequacy. The RBC laws provide for four levels of
regulatory action. The extent of regulatory intervention and
action increases as the ratio of total adjusted capital to RBC
falls. The first level, the company action level, requires an
insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the regulator
if total adjusted capital falls below 200% of the RBC amount (or
below 250%, when the insurer has a “negative trend” as
defined under the RBC laws if the insurer is a life and health
insurer). The second level, the regulatory action level,
requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective
actions and requires the relevant insurance commissioner to
perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective
order if total adjusted capital falls below 150% of the RBC
amount. The third level, the authorized control level,
authorizes the relevant insurance commissioner to take whatever
regulatory actions considered necessary to protect the best
interests of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer,
which may include the actions necessary to cause the insurer to
be placed under regulatory control, i.e., rehabilitation or
liquidation, if total adjusted capital falls below 100% of the
RBC amount. The fourth action level is the mandatory control
level, which requires the relevant insurance commissioner to
place the insurer under regulatory control if total adjusted
capital falls below 70% of the RBC amount.

The formulas have not been designed to
differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that
operate with higher levels of capital. Therefore, it is
inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to
rank these companies. At December 31, 2003, all of our
insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of
amounts requiring company or regulatory action at any prescribed
RBC action level.

Federal Regulation

General

In 1945, the U.S. Congress enacted the
McCarran-Ferguson Act which declared the regulation of insurance
to be primarily the responsibility of the individual states.
Although repeal of McCarran-Ferguson is debated in the
U.S. Congress from time to time, the federal government
generally does not directly regulate the insurance business.
However, federal legislation and administrative policies in
several areas, including



healthcare, pension regulation, age and sex
discrimination, financial services regulation, securities
regulation, privacy laws, terrorism and federal taxation, do
affect the insurance business.

Federal Securities Regulation of Fortis
    Variable Insurance Product Business

Two of our subsidiaries, Fortis Benefits
Insurance Company and First Fortis Life Insurance Company, are
subject to various federal securities regulations because they
have been involved in the issuance of variable insurance
products that are required to be registered as securities under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act). These
registered insurance contracts, which are no longer being sold,
have been 100% reinsured with The Hartford through modified
coinsurance agreements. The Hartford now administers this closed
block of business pursuant to a third-party administration
agreement. Nevertheless, because these two subsidiaries are
still considered the issuers of the products, they are subject
to regulation by the SEC. As a result, they must file periodic
reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(Exchange Act) and are periodically examined for compliance with
applicable federal securities laws by the SEC.

The Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)

As with other lines of insurance, the regulation
of health insurance historically has been within the domain of
the states. However, HIPAA and the implementing regulations
promulgated thereunder by the Department of Health and Human
Services impose new obligations for issuers of health and dental
insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors.
HIPAA requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of
health insurance coverage for individuals and small employer
groups (generally 50 or fewer employees) and limits exclusions
based on pre-existing conditions. Most of the insurance reform
provisions of HIPAA became effective for plan years beginning on
or after July 1, 1997.

HIPAA also establishes new requirements for
maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually
identifiable health information and new standards for electronic
health care transactions. The Department of Health and Human
Services promulgated final HIPAA regulations in 2002. The
privacy regulations required compliance by April 2003, the
electronic transactions regulations by October 2003 and the
security regulations by April 2005. As have other entities in
the health care industry, we have incurred substantial costs in
meeting the requirements of these HIPAA regulations and expect
to continue to incur costs to achieve and to maintain
compliance. We have been working diligently to comply with these
regulations in the time periods required. However, there can be
no assurances that we will achieve such compliance with all of
the required transactions or that other entities with which we
interact will take appropriate action to meet the compliance
deadlines. Moreover, as a consequence of these new standards for
electronic transactions, we may see an increase in the number of
health care transactions that are submitted to us in paper
format, which could increase our costs to process medical claims.

HIPAA is far-reaching and complex and proper
interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve.
Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our
business practices to comply with HIPAA are ongoing. Failure to
comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits.
Knowing and intentional violations of these rules may also
result in federal criminal penalties.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act

On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Act was enacted to ensure the availability of
insurance coverage for terrorist acts in the United States. This
law requires insurers writing certain lines of property and
casualty insurance to offer coverage against certain acts of
terrorism causing damage within the United States or to
U.S. flagged vessels or aircraft. In return, the law
requires the federal government to indemnify such insurers for
90% of insured losses resulting from covered acts of terrorism,
subject to a premium-based deductible. Any existing policy
exclusions for such coverage were immediately nullified by the
law, although such exclusions may be reinstated if either the
insured consents to reinstatement or fails to pay any applicable
increase in premium resulting from the additional coverage
within 30 days of being notified of such an increase. It
should be noted that an “act of terrorism” as defined
by the law excludes purely domestic terrorism. For an act of
terrorism to have occurred, the U.S. Secretary of the
Treasury must make several



findings, including that the act was committed on
behalf of a foreign person or foreign interest. The law expires
automatically at the end of 2005.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act required the
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to conduct an expedited
study as to whether or not group life insurance should be
covered under the law. Based on the study, the Secretary
concluded that inclusion of group life insurance was not
appropriate.

We have a geographically diverse block of group
life business and have secured limited reinsurance protection
against catastrophic losses in our group life product line.
Nevertheless, we are exposed to the risk of substantial group
life losses from a catastrophe, including a terrorist act.

Given that our property and casualty insurance
products primarily cover personal residences and personal
property, we do not believe our property and casualty exposure
to terrorist acts to be significant.

USA PATRIOT Act

On October 26, 2001, the International Money
Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001
was enacted into law as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. Among its
many provisions the law requires that financial institutions
adopt anti-money laundering programs that include policies,
procedures and controls to detect and prevent money laundering,
designate a compliance officer to oversee the program and
provide for employee training, and periodic audits in accordance
with regulations proposed by the U.S. Treasury Department.
Proposed Treasury regulations governing portions of our life
insurance business would require us to develop and implement
procedures designed to detect and prevent money laundering and
terrorist financing. We remain subject to U.S. regulations
that prohibit business dealings with entities identified as
threats to national security. We have licensed software to
enable us to detect and prevent such activities in compliance
with existing regulations and we are developing policies and
procedures designed to comply with the proposed regulations
should they come into effect.

There are significant criminal and civil
penalties that can be imposed for violation of the
aforementioned Treasury regulations. We believe that the steps
we are taking to comply with the current regulations and to
prepare for compliance with the proposed regulations should be
sufficient to minimize the risks of such penalties.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act

On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act of 1999 became law, implementing fundamental changes in the
regulation of the financial services industry in the United
States. The act permits the transformation of the already
converging banking, insurance and securities industries by
permitting mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and
securities firms under one holding company. Under the Act,
national banks retain their existing ability to sell insurance
products in some circumstances. In addition, bank holding
companies that qualify and elect to be treated as
“financial holding companies” may engage in
activities, and acquire companies engaged in activities, that
are “financial” in nature or “incidental” or
“complementary” to such financial activities,
including acting as principal, agent or broker in selling life,
property and casualty and other forms of insurance, including
annuities. A financial holding company can own any kind of
insurance company or insurance broker or agent, but its bank
subsidiary cannot own the insurance company. Under state law,
the financial holding company would need to apply to the
insurance commissioner in the insurer’s state of domicile
for prior approval of the acquisition of the insurer, and the
act provides that the commissioner, in considering the
application, may not discriminate against the financial holding
company because it is affiliated with a bank. Under the Act, no
state may prevent or interfere with affiliations between banks
and insurers, insurance agents or brokers, or the licensing of a
bank or affiliate as an insurer or agent or broker. Privacy
provisions of the Act became fully effective in 2001. These
provisions established consumer protections regarding the
security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information
and require us to make full disclosure of our privacy policies
to our customers.



Regulation by the Federal Reserve
    Board

Fortis Bank, which is a subsidiary of Fortis,
obtained approval in 2002 from state banking authorities and the
Federal Reserve Board to establish branch offices in Connecticut
and New York. By virtue of the opening of these offices,
the U.S. operations of Fortis, including our operations,
became subject to the nonbanking prohibitions of Section 4
of the BHCA. In order to continue to operate its
U.S. nonbanking operations, including the insurance
activities conducted by our subsidiaries, Fortis notified the
Federal Reserve Board of its election to be a financial holding
company for purposes of the BHCA and the Federal Reserve
Board’s implementing regulations in Regulation Y.
Pursuant to Fortis’ status as a financial holding company,
Fortis and its subsidiaries, including our subsidiaries, are
permitted to engage in nonbanking activities in the United
States that are “financial in nature” or
“incidental to a financial activity” as defined in
Section 4(k) of the BHCA and in Regulation Y. In
particular, Fortis’ status as a financial holding company
permits Fortis to engage in the United States in both banking
activities through the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank and
insurance activities through our subsidiaries. Activities that
are “financial in nature” include, among other things,
insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying against loss, harm,
damage, illness, disability, or death, or providing and issuing
annuities, and acting as principal, agent or broker for purposes
of the foregoing.

Fortis will continue to qualify as a financial
holding company so long as Fortis Bank remains “well
capitalized” and “well managed” as those terms
are defined in Regulation Y. Generally, Fortis Bank will be
considered “well capitalized” if it maintains tier 1
and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 6% and 10%,
respectively, and will be considered “well managed” if
it has received at least a satisfactory composite rating of its
U.S. branch operations at its most recent examination. As a
general matter, as long as Fortis controls us within the meaning
of the BHCA or owns more than 5% of any class of our voting
shares, the BHCA does not permit us to engage in nonfinancial
activities such as manufacturing, distribution of goods and real
estate development except to the extent that another exemption
under the BHCA, such as the merchant banking exemption, is
available. If the Federal Reserve Board were to determine that
any of our existing activities were not insurance activities or
not otherwise financial in nature or not incidental to such
activities, or if Fortis lost and was unable to regain its
financial holding company status, we could be required to
restructure our operations or divest some of these operations,
which could result in increased costs and reduced profitability.

The Federal Reserve Board oversees all of
Fortis’ direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries for
compliance with the BHCA, including our Company. Our Company
will be considered a subsidiary of Fortis so long as Fortis owns
25% or more of any class of our voting shares or otherwise
controls us within the meaning of the BHCA. In addition, even if
we are not a subsidiary of Fortis, the nonfinancial activities
restrictions of the BHCA and Regulation Y (discussed above)
would continue to apply so long as Fortis owned more than 5% of
any class of our voting shares and another BHCA exemption, such
as the merchant banking exemption, is not available.

Legislative Developments

Legislation has been introduced in the
U.S. Congress that would allow state-chartered and
regulated insurance companies, such as our insurance
subsidiaries, to choose instead to be regulated exclusively by a
federal insurance regulator. We do not believe that such
legislation will be enacted during the current Congressional
term.

Numerous proposals to reform the current health
care system have been introduced in the U.S. Congress and
in various state legislatures. Proposals have included, among
other things, modifications to the existing employer-based
insurance system, a quasi-regulated system of “managed
competition” among health insurers, and a single-payer,
public program. Changes in health care policy could
significantly affect our business. For example, federally
mandated, comprehensive major medical insurance, if proposed and
implemented, could partially or fully replace some of our
current products. Furthermore, legislation has been introduced
from time to time in the U.S. Congress that could result in
the federal government assuming a more direct role in regulating
insurance companies.

In addition, the U.S. Congress is
considering the expansion of risk retention groups, which were
originally established in 1986 to address the lack of available
product liability insurance. Risk retention groups may be



chartered in a state with favorable regulations
and then proceed to do business in any state, even though
insurance companies competing in the other states may be subject
to more stringent regulations. This is a continuing risk to the
extended service contract business at Assurant Solutions.

There is also legislation pending in the
U.S. Congress and in various states designed to provide
additional privacy protections to consumer customers of
financial institutions. Legislation in the United States or
other jurisdictions could affect our ability to market our
products or otherwise limit the nature or scope of our insurance
operations.

The NAIC and individual states have been studying
small face amount life insurance for the past two years. Some
initiatives that have been raised at the NAIC include further
disclosure for small face amount policies and restrictions on
premium to benefit ratios. The NAIC is also studying other
issues such as “suitability” of insurance products for
certain customers. This may have an effect on our pre-funded
funeral insurance business. Suitability requirements such as a
customer assets and needs worksheet could extend and complicate
the sale of pre-funded funeral insurance products.

Medical Savings Accounts were created by
U.S. Congress as a trial program in 1996. MSAs allow
self-employed individuals, as well as employees of small
employers (i.e., employers with 50 or fewer employees), to set
aside funds on a tax-free basis for the purpose of paying
eligible medical expenses, so long as such persons are covered
under a high-deductible health insurance policy. MSA health
insurance policies have become an important and growing product
line for Assurant Health. On December 8, 2003, the Medicare
Prescription & Modernization Act was signed into law.
This Act includes a provision providing for HSAs. In addition,
the House passed a 12-month extension on MSAs, providing a
transition period for the continued offering of MSAs.

Foreign Jurisdictions

A portion of our business is carried on in
foreign countries. We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in
Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos
Islands and the United Kingdom. Certain subsidiaries operate in
Canada under the branch system. The degree of regulation and
supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some
to stringent in others. Generally, our insurance subsidiaries
operating in such jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory
requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our
insurance subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation
by such authorities, and these subsidiaries could be prevented
from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where
they currently operate. In the past, we have been allowed to
modify our operations to conform with new licensing requirements
in most jurisdictions.

In addition to licensing requirements, our
foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions
with respect to: currency, policy language and terms, amount and
type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount
and type of local investment and the share of profits to be
returned to policyholders on participating policies.

Some foreign countries regulate rates on various
types of policies. Certain countries have established
reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the
state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a
portion of their business on terms which do not always allow
foreign insurers full compensation. In some countries,
regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and
remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and
repatriation of assets.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we had
approximately 12,200 employees. In Assurant Solutions, we have
employees in Argentina and Brazil who are represented by labor
unions. None of our other employees are subject to collective
bargaining agreements governing employment with us or
represented by labor unions. We believe that we have an
excellent relationship with our employees.



Item 2.

Properties

We own seven properties, including five buildings
that serve as headquarters locations for our operating business
segments and two buildings that serve as call centers for
Assurant Solutions. Assurant Solutions has headquarters
buildings located in Miami, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia.
Assurant Solutions call centers are located in Florence, South
Carolina and Springfield, Ohio. Assurant Employee Benefits has a
headquarters building in Kansas City, Missouri. Assurant Health
has a headquarters building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Assurant
Preneed’s AMLIC channel has a headquarters building in
Rapid City, South Dakota. We lease office space for various
offices and service centers located throughout the United States
and internationally, including our New York corporate
office, Assurant PreNeed’s Independent channel headquarters
in Atlanta and our data center in Woodbury, Minnesota. Our
leases have terms ranging from month-to-month to twenty-five
years. We believe that our owned and leased properties are
adequate for our current business operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are regularly involved in litigation in the
ordinary course of business, both as a defendant and as a
plaintiff. We may from time to time be subject to a variety of
legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past
business operations. While we cannot predict the outcome of any
pending or future litigation, examination or investigation, we
do not believe that any pending matter will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.

Assurant Solutions segment is subject to a number
of pending actions, primarily in the State of Mississippi, many
of which allege that our credit insurance products were packaged
and sold with lenders’ products without buyer consent. The
judicial climate in Mississippi is such that the outcome of
these cases is extremely unpredictable. We have been advised by
legal counsel that we have meritorious defenses to all claims
being asserted against us. We believe, based on information
currently available, that the amounts accrued for any losses are
adequate.

American Bankers Insurance Group (ABIG), part of
Assurant Solutions, on behalf of certain subsidiaries, including
ABIC and ABLAC, previously entered into a Consent Order and a
comprehensive Compliance Plan with 43 participating states
relating to compliance with the often disparate state insurance
laws, regulations and administrative interpretations which have
been difficult to apply to the marketing of ABIG’s credit
insurance products through financial institutions, retailers and
other entities offering consumer financing as a regular part of
their business. In addition to an initial settlement of
$12 million, ABIG agreed to a multi-state market conduct
examination commencing November 23, 1999, for review of
ABIG’s implementation of the Compliance Plan. A final
report was issued on December 19, 2001, and ABIG paid a
final settlement of $3 million to participating states.

In February 2002, the State of Minnesota
initiated an enforcement action against ABIC and ABLAC, in
connection with certain alleged regulatory violations.
Thereafter, ABIC and ABLAC filed suit in Minnesota state court
seeking to enjoin the enforcement action because the alleged
regulatory matters included within the enforcement action were
resolved as a part of the above-described Consent Order and
Compliance Plan to which Minnesota was a party. In February
2003, the State of Minnesota, ABIC and ABLAC reached a final
settlement of all matters included within the enforcement action
and the separate state court action filed by ABIC and ABLAC.
Pursuant to the settlement, ABIC and ABLAC each agreed to pay
$100,000 to the State of Minnesota and agreed to compensate the
state for its investigative costs, which totaled
$1.8 million. In addition, ABIC and ABLAC agreed to stop
selling insurance in Minnesota for five years, though they
could apply for reinstatement in 20 months. Other member
companies of the Assurant Solutions segment with product lines
that overlap those offered by ABIC and ABLAC currently remain
authorized to do business in the State of Minnesota. We do not
believe that the effect of the settlement during the next
five years will have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations.

On October 1, 2003, a grand jury in Mower
County, Minnesota issued an indictment of ABIC and two corporate
officers of the Assurant Solutions segment. The indictment
alleges that ABIC and its two named corporate officers each
violated the Minnesota Fair Campaign Practices Act in connection
with two contributions by ABIC to the Republican National State
Election Committee totaling $15,000. The



maximum penalty for ABIC is a $40,000 fine for
each alleged violation and/or forfeiture of ABIC’s license
to conduct business in Minnesota. In addition, the maximum
monetary penalty for each officer would be $20,000 per
violation, which we may reimburse under certain circumstances.
Other member companies of the Assurant Solutions segment with
product lines that overlap those offered by ABIC remain
authorized to conduct business in the State of Minnesota. ABIC
believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims being
asserted against it, and we believe, based on information
currently available, that any liabilities that could result are
not expected to have a material effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

In addition, one of our subsidiaries, American
Reliable Insurance Company (ARIC), participated in certain
excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as
a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap
risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a
portion of these risks to other reinsurers (retrocessionaires).
ARIC ceased writing such business in 1997. However, certain
risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance
contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers
involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties
on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and
non-disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries
involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the
retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with
ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking
collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The
disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and
allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated
claims “spirals” devised to disproportionately pass
claims losses to higher-level reinsurance layers. Many of the
companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are
currently involved in negotiations, arbitration and/or
litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires,
reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including
brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those
disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those
involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss
accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program
year were adequate. However, our exposure under the 1995 program
year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the
1996 and 1997 program years. We believe, based on information
currently available, that the amounts accrued for currently
outstanding disputes are adequate. The inherent uncertainty of
arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of
estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the
future, would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to
predict the outcomes with certainty.

As a result of regulatory scrutiny of our
industry practices or our businesses, such as examinations of
race-based premiums charged in the past by two of our acquired
subsidiaries, it is possible that we may be subject to legal
proceedings in the future relating to those practices and
businesses. See “Item 1 —
Business — Regulation.”

PART II

Item 5.

Market For Registrant’s Common Equity,
    Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities

Common Stock Price

Our common stock began trading on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol
“AIZ” on February 5, 2004. Prior to such date,
there was no established public trading market for our common
stock. On March 1, 2004, the closing price of our common
stock on the NYSE was $25.80.

Holders

As of March 1, 2004, there were
approximately 14,900 holders of record of our common stock, and
we estimate that there were approximately 38 beneficial owners
of our common stock.

Preferred Stock

Our board of directors has the authority, without
further action of our stockholders, to issue up to
200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$1.00 per share, in one or more series and to fix the
powers, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof, which may include dividend rights,
conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption,
liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting
any series or the designations of the series.

As of March 1, 2004, we have designated two
series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock: Series B,
of which 19,160 shares were outstanding; and Series C,
of which 5,000 shares were outstanding. All of such
outstanding shares have a liquidation price of $1,000 per
share and rank senior to our common stock with respect to the
right to receive dividends and to receive distributions upon the
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Assurant, Inc.
Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to
receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 4.0% per share
per annum, multiplied by the $1,000 per share liquidation
price, and holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are
entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 4.5% per share
per annum, multiplied by the $1,000 per share liquidation
price. All dividends are payable in arrears on a quarterly
basis. Any dividend that is not paid on a specified dividend
payment date with respect to a share of such Preferred Stock
shall be deemed added to the liquidation price of such share for
purposes of computing the future dividends on such share, until
such delinquent dividend has been paid in full.

Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock may
elect to have any or all of their shares redeemed by us at any
time after April 1, 2002 and we must redeem all shares of
the Series B Preferred Stock no later than July 1,
2017. Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock may elect to
have any or all of their shares redeemed by us at any time after
the earlier of (i) April 1, 2022, and
(ii) certain specified events, and we must redeem all
shares of the Series C Preferred Stock no later than
July 1, 2027. We also have the right and the obligation to
redeem the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain specified events.
The redemption price in all cases shall equal the
$1,000 per share liquidation price plus all accumulated and
unpaid dividends. We are not required to establish any sinking
fund or similar funds with respect to such redemptions.

None of the shares of Series B Preferred
Stock or Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into
common stock or any other equity security of Assurant, Inc.
However, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote per share
owned of record on all matters voted upon by Assurant, Inc.
stockholders, voting with the holders of common stock as a
single class, and not as a separate class or classes. The shares
of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock are subject to certain restrictions on transferability,
and we have the right of first refusal to acquire the shares if
any holder thereof desires to make a transfer not otherwise
permitted by the terms thereof.



Dividend Policy

Our board of directors currently intends to
authorize the payment of a dividend of $0.07 per share of
common stock per quarter to our stockholders of record beginning
in the second quarter of 2004. Any determination to pay
dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors
and will be dependent upon: our subsidiaries’ payment of
dividends and/or other statutorily permissible payments to us;
our results of operations and cash flows; our financial position
and capital requirements; general business conditions; any
legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the
payment of dividends; and any other factors our board of
directors deems relevant.

We are a holding company and, therefore, our
ability to pay dividends, service our debt and meet our other
obligations depends primarily on the ability of our insurance
subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other statutorily
permissible payments to us. Our insurance subsidiaries are
subject to significant regulatory and contractual restrictions
limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. See
“Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risk Factors — Risks Relating
to Our Company — The inability of our subsidiaries to
pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability
to meet our obligations and pay future stockholder
dividends.” For the calendar year 2003, the maximum amount
of dividends that our subsidiaries could pay to us under
applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory
approval was approximately $290 million, of which
approximately $99.5 million had been paid as of
December 31, 2003. In addition, as part of the regulatory
approval process for the acquisition of ABIG in 1999, we entered
into an agreement with the Florida Insurance Department pursuant
to which two of our subsidiaries, ABIC and ABLAC, have agreed to
limit the amount of ordinary dividends they would pay to us to
an amount no greater than 50% of the amount otherwise permitted
under Florida law. This agreement expires in August 2004. One of
our subsidiaries, First Fortis Life Insurance Company, also
entered into an agreement with the New York Insurance
Department as part of the regulatory approval process for the
merger of Bankers American Life Assurance Company into First
Fortis Life Insurance Company in 2001 pursuant to which First
Fortis Life Insurance Company has agreed not to pay any ordinary
dividends to us until fiscal year 2004.

In addition, payments of dividends on the Common
Stock are subject to the preferential rights of the
Series B and Series C Preferred Stock described above,
as well as any other outstanding series of preferred stock that
our board of directors may create from time to time. For more
information regarding restrictions on the payment of dividends
by us and our insurance subsidiaries, including pursuant to the
terms of our credit facilities, see
“Item 1 — Business —
Regulation — United States — State
Regulation — Insurance Regulation Concerning
Dividends” and “— Statutory Accounting
Practices (SAP)” and “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

In addition, our $500 million senior
revolving credit facility restricts payments of dividends in the
event that an event of default under the facility has occurred
or a proposed dividend payment would cause an event of default
under the facility. The revolving credit facility provides for
general events of default including: failure to pay principal of
or interest on any loans under the revolving credit facility;
failure to perform or comply with any convenant; breach of any
representations or warranties made; default in the performance
or compliance with any term that is not remedied or waived
within a specified period of time; loss of any insurance license
or certain regulatory actions if such action would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect; acceleration of or
failure to make payments in respect of debt exceeding a
specified amount subject to any applicable grace period, or any
breach or default with respect to any other material term of
such debt; judgment defaults in excess of a specified amount;
certain events of bankruptcy or dissolution; and failure to
comply with certain ERISA matters. In addition, events of
default include the acquisition of more than 30% of our voting
power and/or equity securities by any person or group (other
than the existing control group).



Recent Sales of Unregistered
Securities

During the period from 2000 to 2003, pursuant to
the Assurant Investment Plan, the Company granted to key
employees, in exchange for all or a portion of such
employees’ eligible compensation, options to purchase
shares or other equity interests in certain third-party mutual
funds, which shares or other equity interests have been
registered under the Securities Act. The option grants were made
by the Company in reliance on the exemptions from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by
(a) Rule 701 under the Securities Act as issuances by
a company not subject to the reporting requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act),
pursuant to a written compensatory benefit plan of such company
established for its directors and senior employees, and/or
(b) Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as issuances to
a limited number of sophisticated investors in transactions not
involving any public offering.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this report. It
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Please see “Forward-Looking Statements”
for more information. Our actual results could differ materially
from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of various factors, including those discussed below and
elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings
“— Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking
Statements.”

General

We pursue a differentiated strategy of building
leading positions in specialized market segments for insurance
products and related services in North America and selected
other markets. We provide: creditor-placed homeowners insurance;
manufactured housing homeowners insurance; debt protection
administration; credit insurance; warranties and extended
service contracts; individual health and small employer group
health insurance; group dental insurance; group disability
insurance; group life insurance and pre-funded funeral insurance.

The markets we target are generally complex, have
a relatively limited number of competitors and, we believe,
offer attractive profit opportunities.



We report our results through five segments:
Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits,
Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and
Other segment includes activities of the holding company,
financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments,
interest income earned from short-term investments held and
interest income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries
not allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment
includes the results of operations of FFG from January 1,
2001 to March 31, 2001 (the period prior to its
disposition). The Corporate and Other segment also includes the
amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of
the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through
reinsurance agreements as described below.

Critical Factors Affecting Results

Our profitability depends on the adequacy of our
product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our
methodology for the establishment of reserves for future
policyholder benefits and claims, returns on invested assets and
our ability to manage our expenses. As such, factors affecting
these items may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations or financial condition.

Revenues

We derive our revenues primarily from the sale of
our insurance policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by
providing administrative services to certain clients. Sales of
insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums
while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee
income. In late 2000, the majority of our credit insurance
clients began a transition from the purchase of our credit
insurance products from which we earned premium revenue to debt
protection administration programs, from which we earn fee
income. Debt protection administration programs include services
for non-insurance products that cancel or defer the required
monthly payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur.

Our premium and fee income is supplemented by
income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize
revenue from interest payments, dividends and sales of
investments. Our investment portfolio is currently primarily
invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income
and realized capital gains on these investments can be
significantly impacted by changes in interest rates.

In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes
whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits and
obtains much of its profits through interest rate spreads.
Interest rate spreads refer to the difference between the death
benefit growth rates on pre-funded funeral insurance policies
and the investment returns generated on the assets we hold
related to those policies. As of December 31, 2003,
approximately 81% of Assurant PreNeed’s in force insurance
policy reserves relate to policies that provide for death
benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit
growth pegged to changes in the Consumer Price Index. In
extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation,
there may be compression in the spread between Assurant
PreNeed’s death benefit growth rates and its investment
earnings. As a result, declining interest rates or high
inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and our overall financial condition.

Expenses

Our expenses primarily consist of policyholder
benefits, underwriting, general and administrative expenses, and
distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees,
amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and value of
businesses acquired (VOBA) and general operating expenses. For a
description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2, 18 and 19 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this report.

Our profitability depends in large part on
accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs,
including medical and dental costs. It also depends on our
ability to manage future benefit and other costs through



product design, underwriting criteria,
utilization review or claims management and, in health and
dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts.
Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the
economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also
materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs.
As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors,
claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

In addition, in December 2003 and January 2004,
we redeemed all of the mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts for a redemption price equal to
their aggregate liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of redemption and aggregate premium of
approximately $206 million, all of which was expensed in
the fourth quarter of 2003. We entered into the senior bridge
credit facilities described under “— Liquidity
and Capital Resources” in connection with these redemptions.

Regulation

Legislation or other regulatory reform that
increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that
changes the way we are able to do business may significantly
harm our business or results of operations in the future. For
example, some states have imposed new time limits for the
payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care
and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims
not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states
have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional
authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on
health and dental plans engaging in certain “unfair payment
practices.” If we were to be unable for any reason to
comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial
costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

For other factors affecting our results of
operations or financial condition, see “— Risk
Factors.”

Acquisitions and Dispositions of
    Businesses

Our results of operations were affected by the
following transactions:

On October 10, 2002, we sold the Peer Review
and Analysis division (PRA) of CORE, Inc. (CORE) to MCMC, LLC,
an independent provider of medical analysis services. No gain or
loss was recognized on the sale of PRA.

On June 28, 2002, we sold our 50% ownership
in Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP) to NHP Holding LLC. We
recorded pre-tax gains on sale of $11 million, which was
included in the Corporate and Other segment.

On December 31, 2001, we acquired Protective
Life Corporation’s Dental Benefits Division (DBD),
including the acquisition through reinsurance of
Protective’s indemnity dental, life and disability business
and its prepaid dental subsidiaries. Total revenues of
$305 million and income after tax of $15 million were
generated by the DBD operations for the year ended
December 31, 2002. DBD is included in Assurant Employee
Benefits.

On July 12, 2001, we acquired CORE, a
national provider of employee absence management services. Total
revenues of $31 million and income after tax of
$0.2 million were generated by the CORE operations from
July 12, 2001 through December 31, 2001, as compared
to total revenues of $66 million and income after tax of
$3 million in 2002. CORE is included in Assurant Employee
Benefits.

On April 2, 2001, we sold our FFG business
to The Hartford primarily through a reinsurance arrangement.
Total revenues of $146 million and income after tax of
$8 million were generated by the FFG operations for the
three months ended March 31, 2001, compared to total
revenues of $669 million and income after tax of
$65 million during 2000. FFG included certain individual
life insurance policies, investment-type annuity contracts and
mutual fund operations. The sale of the mutual fund operations



resulted in $62 million of pre-tax gains.
The sale via reinsurance of the individual life insurance
policies and investment-type annuity contracts resulted in
$558 million of pre-tax gains, which were deferred upon
closing and are being amortized over the remaining life of the
contracts. All activities related to FFG are included in the
Corporate and Other segment. See “— Critical
Accounting Policies.”

Prior to April 2, 2001, FFG had issued
variable insurance products that are required to be registered
as securities under the Securities Act. Variable insurance
refers to an investment oriented life insurance policy that
offers fixed premiums and a minimum death benefit as well as
providing a return linked to an underlying portfolio of
securities. These registered insurance contracts, which we no
longer sell, have been 100% reinsured with The Hartford through
modified coinsurance agreements. The Hartford administers this
closed block of business pursuant to a third party
administration agreement. Since this block of business was sold
through modified coinsurance agreements, separate account assets
and separate account liabilities associated with these products
continue to be reflected in our financial statements. See the
line items entitled “Assets held in separate accounts”
and “Liabilities related to separate accounts” in our
consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities created by these
variable insurance policies are tied to the performance of
underlying investments held in separate accounts of the
insurance company that originally issued such policies. While we
own the separate account assets, the laws governing separate
accounts provide that the income, gains and losses from assets
in the separate account are credited to or charged against the
separate account without regard to other income, gains or losses
of the insurer. Further, the laws provide that the separate
account will not be charged with liabilities arising out of any
other business the insurer may conduct. The result of this
structure is that the assets held in the separate account
correspond to and are equal to the liabilities created by the
variable insurance contracts. At December 31, 2003, we had
separate account assets and liabilities of $3,805 million
compared to $4,809 million on April 2, 2001, the date
of the FFG sale.

Comparing our results from period to period
requires taking into account these acquisitions and
dispositions. For a more detailed description of these
acquisitions and dispositions, see Notes 3 and 4 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this report.

Critical Accounting Policies

There are certain accounting policies that we
consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and
uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies. In
calculating financial statement estimates, the use of different
assumptions could produce materially different estimates. In
addition, if factors such as those described above or in
“— Risk Factors” cause actual events to
differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting
policies and calculating financial estimates, there could be a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity.

We believe the following critical accounting
policies require significant estimates which, if such estimates
are not materially correct, could affect the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements.

Premiums

Short Duration Contracts

Our short duration contracts are those on which
we recognize revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract term.
Our short duration contracts primarily include: group term life,
group disability medical and dental, property and warranty,
credit life and disability, extended service contracts and
individual medical issued after 2002 in most jurisdictions.

Long Duration Contracts

Currently, our long duration contracts being sold
are pre-funded funeral life insurance and investment-type
annuities. For pre-funded funeral life insurance policies, any
excess of the gross premium over the net premium is deferred and
is recognized in income in a constant relationship with the
insurance in force. For



pre-funded funeral investment-type annuity
contracts, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy
balances.

For individual medical contracts sold prior to
2003 and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions and
traditional life insurance contracts sold by Assurant PreNeed
that are no longer offered, revenue is recognized when due from
policyholders.

For universal life insurance and investment-type
annuity contracts sold by Assurant Solutions that are no longer
offered, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy
balances.

Premiums for LTC insurance and traditional life
insurance contracts within FFG are recognized as revenue when
due from the policyholder. For universal life insurance and
investment-type annuity contracts within FFG, revenues consist
of charges assessed against policy balances. For the FFG and LTC
businesses previously sold, all revenue is ceded to The Hartford
and John Hancock, respectively.

Reinsurance Assumed

Reinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based
upon payments received from ceding companies together with
accrual estimates which are based on both payments received and
in force policy information received from ceding companies. Any
subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in
the period in which they are determined.

Fee Income

We primarily derive income from fees received
from providing administration services. Fee income is earned
when services are performed.

Reserves

Reserves are established according to generally
accepted actuarial principles and are based on a number of
factors. These factors include experience derived from
historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at
loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors
include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to
which all claims have been reported and internal claims
processing charges. The process used in computing reserves
cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since
actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as
inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage
awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing
the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated.

Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or
statutory accounting principles, do not represent an exact
calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best
estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given
time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and
administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on
our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The
adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims
severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other
factors. These variables are affected by both external and
internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes
in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical
perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of
disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment
or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative
changes and claims handling procedures.

Many of these items are not directly
quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve
estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to
reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the
statement of operations of the period in which such estimates
are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently
uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there
can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed
existing claims reserves. Future loss development could require
reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse
effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases
are made.



Short Duration Contracts

For short duration contracts, claims and benefits
payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The
liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the
claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include
(1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the
balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported (IBNR)
reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has
not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and
(3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected
handling costs of settling the claims.

For group disability and group life, the case
reserves and IBNR are recorded at an amount equal to the net
present value of the expected future claims payments. Group
long-term disability and group term life waiver of premium
reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation
interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by
taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on
our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses
and provisions for adverse deviation. In July 2003, the
valuation interest rate was lowered to 5.25% from 6% for group
long-term disability and raised to 5.25% from 3.5% for group
term life waiver of premium reserves.

Unearned premium reserves are maintained for the
portion of the premiums on short duration contracts that is
related to the unexpired period of the policy.

We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and
other general liability claims arising from our participation in
various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1983. This exposure
arose from a short duration contract that we discontinued
writing many years ago. We carried case reserves for these
liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and bulk
reserves for IBNR of $37 million (before reinsurance) and
$36 million (after reinsurance) in the aggregate at
December 31, 2003. Any estimation of these liabilities is
subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to
the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays
and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for
those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal
issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what
constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of
ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to
financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However,
based on information currently available, and after
consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial
statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for
these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. Asbestos,
environmental and other general liability claim payments, net of
reinsurance recoveries, were $2.9 million,
$1.4 million and $2.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

One of our subsidiaries, (ARIC), participated in
certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market
and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom
and kidnap risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate
ceded a portion of these risks to other reinsurers
(retrocessionaires). ARIC ceased writing such business in 1997.
However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature
of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of the other
reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain
treaties on various grounds, including material
misrepresentation and non-disclosure by the ceding companies and
intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the
retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with
ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking
collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The
disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and
allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated
claims “spirals” devised to disproportionately pass
claims losses to higher-level reinsurance layers. Many of the
companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are
currently involved in negotiations, arbitration and/or
litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires,
reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including
brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those
disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those
involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss
accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program
year were adequate. However, our exposure under the 1995 program
year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the
1996 and 1997 program years. We believe, based on information
currently available, that the amounts accrued for currently
outstanding disputes are adequate. The inherent uncertainty



of arbitrations and lawsuits, including the
uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may enter
into in the future would be on favorable terms, makes it
difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty.

Long Duration Contracts

Future policy benefits and expense reserves on
LTC, life insurance policies and annuity contracts that are no
longer offered, individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003
or issued in the state of Minnesota and the traditional life
insurance contracts within FFG are recorded at the present value
of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related
expenses less the present value of the future net premiums.
These amounts are estimated and include assumptions as to the
expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity and
withdrawal rates as well as other assumptions that are based on
our experience. These assumptions reflect anticipated trends and
include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.

Future policy benefits and expense reserves for
pre-funded funeral investment-type annuities, universal life
insurance policies and investment-type annuity contracts that
are no longer offered, and the variable life insurance and
investment-type annuity contracts in FFG consist of policy
account balances before applicable surrender charges and certain
deferred policy initiation fees that are being recognized in
income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged
to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of
policy account balances and interest credited to policy account
balances.

Future policy benefits and expense reserves for
pre-funded funeral life insurance contracts are recorded as the
present value of future benefits to policyholders and related
expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve
assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected
investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates.
These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company
experience and include provision for possible unfavorable
deviation. An unearned premium reserve is also recorded for
these contracts which represents the balance of the excess of
gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized
in future years’ income in a constant relationship to
insurance in force.

Deferred Acquisition Costs
    (DAC)

The costs of acquiring new business that vary
with and are primarily related to the production of new business
have been deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed
recoverable from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition
costs primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance
expenses, premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses.

A premium deficiency is recognized immediately by
a charge to the statement of operations as a reduction of DAC to
the extent that future policy premiums, including anticipation
of interest income, are not adequate to recover all DAC and
related claims, benefits and expenses. If the premium deficiency
is greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for
the excess deficiency.

Short Duration Contracts

DAC relating to property contracts, warranty and
extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance
contracts are amortized over the term of the contracts in
relation to premiums earned.

Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit
insurance business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and
are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of
the underlying contracts.

Acquisition costs on individual medical issued in
most jurisdictions after 2002, small group medical, group term
life and group disability consist primarily of commissions to
agents and brokers, which are level, and compensation to
representatives, which is spread out and is not front-end
loaded. These costs do not vary with the production of new
business. As a result, these costs are not deferred but rather
are recorded in the statement of operations in the period in
which they are incurred.



Long Duration Contracts

Acquisition costs for pre-funded funeral life
insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered
are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums
over the premium-paying period.

For pre-funded funeral investment-type annuities
and universal life insurance policies and investment-type
annuity contracts that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized
in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or
profits from investment, mortality, expense margins and
surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or
contract. The assumptions used for the estimates are consistent
with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities.

Acquisition costs relating to individual medical
contracts issued prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number
of jurisdictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated
average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisition
costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses.
Commissions represent the majority of deferred costs and result
from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in
the first year. The majority of deferred policy issuance
expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each
individual medical contract.

Acquisition costs on the FFG and LTC disposed
businesses were written off when the businesses were sold.

Investments

We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to
ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily
impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued
and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the
proper period. Our methodology to identify potential impairments
requires professional judgment.

Changes in individual security values are
monitored on a semi-monthly basis in order to identify potential
problem credits. In addition, pursuant to our impairment
process, each month the portfolio holdings are screened for
securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their
original purchase price. Management then makes their assessment
as to which of these securities are other than temporarily
impaired. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to,
the financial condition and rating of the issuer, any collateral
held and the length of time the market value of the security has
been below cost. Each month the watchlist is discussed at a
meeting attended by members of our investment, accounting and
finance departments. Each quarter any security whose price
decrease is deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired
is written down to its then current market level, with the
amount of the writedown reflected in our statement of operations
for that quarter. Previously impaired issues are also monitored
monthly, with additional writedowns taken quarterly if necessary.

Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties
involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and
critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more
pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect
one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could
result in additional writedowns in future periods for
impairments that are deemed to be other-than-temporary. See also
“Investments” in Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report.

Reinsurance

Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related
to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy
and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and
policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is
accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured
policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account
for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are
estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment
expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are
reported in our consolidated balance sheets. The ceding of
insurance does not discharge our primary liability to our



insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful
accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of
balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency,
management’s experience and current economic conditions.

Other Accounting Policies

For a description of other accounting policies
applicable to the periods covered by this report, see
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this report.

New Accounting Standard

On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets

(FAS 142). Upon adoption of
FAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill. In addition, we
were required to subject our goodwill to an initial impairment
test. As a result of FAS 142, we are required to conduct
impairment testing on an annual basis and between annual tests
if an event occurs or circumstances change indicating a possible
goodwill impairment. In the absence of an impairment event, our
net income will be higher as a result of not having to amortize
goodwill.

As a result of this initial impairment test, we
recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of
$1,261 million. The impairment charge was recorded as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of
January 1, 2002. The impairment charge had no impact on
cash flows or the statutory-basis capital and surplus of our
insurance subsidiaries. We also performed a January 1, 2003
impairment test during the six months ended June 30, 2003
and concluded that goodwill was not further impaired.

See “New Accounting Pronouncements” in
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this report for a description of
additional new accounting standards that are applicable to us.



Results of Operations

Consolidated Overview

The table below presents information regarding
our consolidated results of operations:

(1)

Includes amortization of DAC and VOBA and
    underwriting, general and administrative expenses.

Note:

The table above includes amortization of goodwill
    in 2001 and the cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle in 2002. These items are only included in this
    Consolidated Overview. As a result, the tables presented under
    the segment discussions do not total to the same amounts shown
    on this consolidated overview table. See Note 20 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in
    this report.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared
    to December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $534 million, or
8%, from $6,532 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to $7,066 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
increased by $476 million, or 8%, from $5,681 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$6,157 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The increase in



net earned premiums and other considerations is
primarily due to increases of $285 million,
$175 million, and $23 million in Assurant Solutions,
Assurant Health, and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively,
with an offsetting decrease of $9 million in Assurant
PreNeed. The increase in Assurant Solutions is due to growth in
specialty property and consumer protection products. The
increase in Assurant Health is primarily due to increases in
individual health insurance business due to membership growth
and premium rate increases.

Net investment income decreased by
$25 million, or 4%, from $632 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $607 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to
a decrease in investment yields driven by the lower interest
rate environment. The yield on average invested assets was 5.61%
for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 6.20%
for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Net realized gains (losses) on investments
improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses
of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on
investments are comprised of both other-than-temporary
impairments and realized capital gains (losses) on sales of
securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had
other-than-temporary impairments of $20 million as compared
to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
There were no individual impairments in excess of
$10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of
$10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity
investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed
maturity investments in AT&T Canada, and an $11 million
writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom.
Excluding the effects of other-than-temporary impairments, we
recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million
in the Corporate and Other segment.

Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of
businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from
$80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
decrease was consistent with the run-off of the businesses ceded
to The Hartford and John Hancock.

Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by
$11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to zero for the year ended
December 31, 2003. There were no disposals in 2003. On
June 28, 2002, we sold our investment in NHP, which
resulted in pretax gains of $11 million.

Fees and other income decreased by
$14 million, or 6%, from $246 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to $232 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to
$15 million of income recognized in Corporate and Other
segment for the year ended December 31, 2002, associated
with a settlement true-up of a 1999 sale of a small block of
business to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances
due to successful collection of receivables that had been
previously written off.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$644 million, or 10%, from $6,162 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to $6,806 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits increased by
$222 million, or 6%, from $3,435 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $3,657 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily
due to increases of $144 million, $95 million, and
$8 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and
Assurant PreNeed, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of
$24 million in Assurant Employee Benefits. The increase in
Assurant Solutions was primarily due to growth in specialty
property products, primarily creditor-placed and voluntary
homeowners insurance lines of business. The increase in Assurant
Health was primarily due to the increase in individual health
insurance business, which is consistent with growth in this
business.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $220 million, or 8%, from $2,609 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$2,829 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The increase was primarily due to increases of
$141 million, $43 million, and $11 million in
Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee
Benefits, respectively. The increase in Assurant Solutions was
consistent with growth in the specialty property and consumer
protection products business. The increase in Assurant Health



was primarily due to increases in commissions,
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general
expenses, which was consistent with the growth in business.

Distributions on preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from
$118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to
$113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We
redeemed $1,250 million of the mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in mid-December 2003,
resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining
$196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
of subsidiary trusts in early January 2004. As a result of the
early extinguishment of all the mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts we incurred $206 million in
interest premiums on redemption of subsidiary trusts for the
year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero in 2002.

Net Income

Net income increased by $1,187 million, or
119%, from a loss of $1,001 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to a profit of $186 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Net income before cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle for the year ended December 31, 2002
was $260 million. When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we
recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
which resulted in an expense of $1,261 million in 2002 as
compared to zero recognized in 2003.

Income taxes decreased by $36 million, or
33%, from $110 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $74 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 28.6% compared to
29.7% in 2002.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared
    to December 31, 2001

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $345 million, or
6%, from $6,187 million in 2001 to $6,532 million in
2002.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
increased by $439 million, or 8%, from $5,242 million
in 2001 to $5,681 million in 2002. Excluding the effect of
the various acquisitions and dispositions described above, net
earned premiums and other considerations increased mainly due to
strong growth in Assurant Solutions primarily as a result of
growth in new business and in Assurant PreNeed primarily due to
an increase in the average size of policies sold by the AMLIC
division.

Net investment income decreased by
$80 million, or 11%, from $712 million in 2001 to
$632 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in achieved investment yields, driven by the lower
interest rate environment and a decrease in average invested
assets of $290 million. The yield on average invested
assets was 6.20% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as
compared to 6.83% for the year ended December 31, 2001.
This reflected lower yields on fixed maturity securities and
commercial mortgages.

Net realized losses on investments decreased by
$1 million, or 1%, from $119 million in 2001 to
$118 million in 2002. In 2002, we had other-than-temporary
impairments of $85 million, as compared to $78 million
in 2001. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess
of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $18 million
writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a
$12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in
AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed
maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Impairments of available
for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2001
consisted of a $22 million writedown of fixed maturity
investments in Enron Corp. (Enron).

Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of
businesses increased by $12 million, or 18%, from
$68 million in 2001 to $80 million in 2002. The
increase was primarily due to a full year of amortization of the
deferred gain on the sale of FFG as compared to nine months of
amortization in 2001. This deferred gain on sale is discussed in
more detail under “— Corporate and Other”
below.



Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by
$51 million, or 82%, from $62 million in 2001 to
$11 million in 2002. The $62 million reflects the gain
on the sale of FFG’s mutual fund operations. The
$11 million reflected the pre-tax gain on the sale of NHP.

Fees and other income increased by
$24 million, or 11%, from $222 million in 2001 to
$246 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to a
full year of fee income from CORE and an increase in fee income
from Assurant Solutions, mainly from their credit insurance
business transitioning to debt protection administration. In
late 2000, the majority of Assurant Solutions’ credit
insurance clients began a transition from use of our credit
insurance products to debt protection administration programs,
from which we earn fee income rather than net earned premiums
and where margins are lower than in the traditional credit
insurance programs. However, because debt protection
administration is not an insurance product, certain costs such
as regulatory costs and cost of capital are expected to be
eliminated as the transition from credit insurance to debt
protection administration services continues. The fees from debt
protection administration did not fully compensate for the
decrease in credit insurance premiums The increases were
partially offset by a $42 million, or 63%, decrease from
the Corporate and Other segment due to the sale of FFG
(partially through reinsurance), which had $65 million of
fee income (generated from mutual fund operations included in
such sale) in the first quarter of 2001.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$181 million, or 3%, from $5,981 million in 2001 to
$6,162 million in 2002.

Policyholder benefits increased by
$195 million, or 6%, from $3,240 million in 2001 to
$3,435 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to
the effects of the acquisitions and dispositions described
above. The increases were also partially offset by an
$84 million, or 6%, decrease from Assurant Health,
primarily due to a higher mix of individual health insurance
business, which generally has a lower expected loss ratio
relative to small employer group business, disciplined pricing
and product design changes. (Loss premiums and other
considerations include the amount of net premiums allocable to
the expired period of an insurance policy or policies, including
fees earned on interest sensitive policies).

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $113 million, or 5%, from $2,496 million
in 2001 to $2,609 million in 2002. Assurant Employee
Benefits contributed $106 million of this increase,
primarily due to the DBD and CORE acquisitions. This increase
was offset by a $65 million decrease in the Corporate and
Other segment due to the sale of FFG. Selling, underwriting and
general expenses in Assurant Health increased by
$50 million, primarily due to an increase in the
amortization of DAC and due to costs associated with higher
employee compensation and investments in technology. Also,
selling, underwriting and general expenses in Assurant PreNeed
increased by $17 million, primarily due to an increase in
amortization of DAC and VOBA as a result of an increase in sales
of single pay policies and increases in general expenses.

Amortization of goodwill was zero in 2002
compared to $113 million in 2001, as a result of our
adoption of FAS 142 as described above.

Interest expense decreased from $14 million
in 2001 to $0 in 2002. In April 2001, we used a portion of the
FFG sale proceeds to repay $225 million of outstanding debt
owed to Fortis Finance N.V. (Fortis Finance), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Fortis.

Distributions on preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts in 2002 remained unchanged from 2001 at
$118 million.

Net Income

Net income decreased by $1,099 million from
a profit of $98 million in 2001 to a loss of
$1,001 million in 2002.



Income taxes increased by $2 million, or 2%,
from $108 million in 2001 to $110 million in 2002. The
effective tax rate for 2002 was 29.7% compared to 52.4% in 2001.
The change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to
the elimination of amortization of goodwill in 2002.

When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we recognized a
cumulative effect (expense) of change in accounting
principle of $1,261 million in 2002 as compared to zero
recognized in 2001.

Assurant Solutions

Overview

The table below presents information regarding
Assurant Solutions’ segment results of operations:

(1)

“Specialty Property Solutions” includes
    a variety of specialized property insurance programs that are
    coupled with differentiated administrative capabilities.

(2)

“Consumer Protection Solutions”
    includes an array of debt protection administration services,
    credit insurance programs and warranties and extended service
    contracts.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared
    to December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $277 million, or
12%, from $2,401 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to $2,678 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
increased by $285 million, or 14%, from $2,077 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$2,362 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
This increase was primarily due to $180 million of
additional net earned premiums and other considerations
attributable to our special property products, which includes
approximately $133 million from our creditor-placed and
voluntary homeowners insurance and manufactured housing
homeowners insurance lines of business generated from new
clients and increased sales growth from our existing clients.
Consumer protection products also



contributed $105 million in net earned
premiums and other considerations primarily from growth in our
warranty and extended service contracts business.

Net investment income decreased by
$18 million, or 9%, from $205 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $187 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The average portfolio yield
dropped 62 basis points from 5.85% for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to 5.23% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate
environment. The average allocated invested assets increased by
approximately 2%.

Fees and other income increased by
$10 million, or 8%, from $119 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $129 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the continuing
transition of our credit insurance business to our debt
protection administration business.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$285 million, or 13%, from $2,204 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $2,489 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits increased by
$144 million, or 19%, from $755 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $899 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Our specialty property products
accounted for $112 million of the increase primarily due to
growth in our creditor-placed and voluntary homeowners insurance
lines of business and approximately $18 million of the
increase is attributable to various catastrophes
($30 million in 2003 compared to $12 million in 2002).
Our consumer protection products also contributed
$32 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our
warranty and extended service contracts line of business.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $141 million, or 10%, from $1,449 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$1,590 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Selling and underwriting expenses increased by
$116 million, which consisted of $45 million primarily
from our specialty property products due to growth in our
creditor-placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and
manufactured housing insurance lines. Also, $71 million of
the increase was from our consumer protection products due to
increased growth in our warranty and extended service contract
lines of business. General expenses increased by
$25 million, primarily from start up costs related to
setting up new clients in the creditor-placed homeowners
insurance area and increased business from our warranty and
extended service contract products.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by
$1 million, or 1%, from $132 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $133 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Excluding the decrease in
investment income of $13 million after-tax, segment income
after tax increased by $14 million, or 11%.

Income taxes decreased by $9 million, or
14%, from $65 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $56 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in pre-tax
income and a lower effective tax rate in 2003.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared
    to December 31, 2001

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $179 million, or
8%, from $2,222 million in 2001 to $2,401 million in
2002.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
increased by $171 million, or 9%, from $1,906 million
in 2001 to $2,077 million in 2002. The increase was
primarily due to approximately $100 million of additional
net earned premiums from our specialty property solutions
products, including approximately $86 million from the growth of
our creditor-placed and voluntary homeowners insurance, flood
insurance and manufactured housing related property coverages.
Consumer protection solutions contributed an additional
$71 million to the increase in net earned premiums
primarily due to the growth of $39 million attributable to
our warranty and extended service contracts business and $58
million from an accidental death and dismemberment product,



which we started selling in 2001 and stopped
selling in 2002. These increases were partly offset by the
decrease in credit insurance products as the transition from
credit insurance products to debt protection administration
programs continued and fees from debt protection administration
programs did not fully compensate for the decrease in credit
insurance premiums. See “Item 1 —
Business — Operating Business Segments —
Assurant Solutions — Consumer Protection
Solutions.”

Net investment income decreased by
$13 million, or 6%, from $218 million in 2001 to
$205 million in 2002. The average portfolio yield dropped
51 basis points from 6.36% in 2001 to 5.85% in 2002 due to the
lower interest rate environment. This decrease was partially
offset by the reinvestment of tax advantaged investments, such
as preferred stock, low-income housing tax credit investments
and tax-exempt municipal bonds, into higher yield taxable
investments. Also, average allocated invested assets increased
by approximately 2%.

Fees and other income increased by
$21 million, or 21%, from $98 million in 2001 to
$119 million in 2002, including $13 million in
additional fee income resulting from our credit insurance
business transitioning to debt protection administration
services.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$120 million, or 6%, from $2,084 million in 2001 to
$2,204 million in 2002.

Policyholder benefits increased by
$115 million, or 18%, from $640 million in 2001 to
$755 million in 2002. Consumer protection solutions
benefits contributed $98 million of this increase due
primarily to $36 million from the warranty and extended
service contracts business and $24 million from an
accidental death and disability product. The increase was partly
offset by a decrease in benefits in credit insurance products,
which related to the decrease in premiums resulting from the
transition to debt protection administration products. The
growth of our specialty property solutions product lines also
contributed a further $17 million to the increase in
policyholder benefits in 2002, including approximately
$11 million of losses related to Hurricane Lili and Arizona
wildfires. In 2001, we had approximately $10 million in
losses related to tropical storm Allison.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $5 million, or less than 1%, from
$1,444 million in 2001 to $1,449 million in 2002.
Commissions, taxes, licenses and fees contributed
$21 million to the increase. The increase was primarily in
our specialty property solutions business from the growth in the
creditor-placed homeowners and manufactured housing homeowners
insurance products. This increase was offset by a decrease in
general expenses of $16 million primarily due to a
non-recurring cost incurred in 2001.

Segment Income After Tax

As a result of the foregoing, segment income
after tax increased by $34 million, or 35%, from
$98 million in 2001 to $132 million in 2002.

Income taxes increased $25 million, or 62%,
from $40 million in 2001 to $65 million in 2002. The
increase was primarily due to a 43% increase in segment income
before income tax. The majority of the remaining increase was
due to an increase in our effective tax rate primarily due to
our decision to reduce our ownership of tax-advantaged
investments.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared
    to December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $179 million, or
9.0%, from $1,912 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to $2,091 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
increased by $175 million, or 10%, from $1,834 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $2,009 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums
attributable to our individual health insurance business
increased $156 million due to membership growth and premium
rate increases. Net earned premiums attributable to our small
employer group health insurance business increased
$19 million primarily because we instituted premium rate
increases in select small group markets to sufficiently price
for the underlying medical costs of existing business and for
anticipated future medical trends.



Net investment income decreased by
$6 million, or 11%, from $55 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $49 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. There was a 69 basis point
decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 6.43% for the
year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.74% for the year ended
December 31, 2003, due to the lower interest rate
environment. Offsetting the decrease in yield was a 5% increase
in average invested assets for the year ended December 31,
2003, over the comparable prior year period.

Fees and other income increased by
$10 million, or 43%, from $23 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $33 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, due to additional insurance policy
fees and higher fee-based product sales in individual markets,
such as sales of our non-insurance health access discount cards.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$138 million, or 8%, from $1,768 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $1,906 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits increased by
$95 million, or 8%, from $1,222 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $1,317 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was consistent
with the increase in net earned premiums and other
considerations. The loss ratio improved 100 basis points from
66.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 65.6% for
the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to our risk
management activities.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $43 million, or 8%, from $546 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002, to $589 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Commissions increased by
$33 million corresponding to an increase in first year net
earned premiums over the prior year. Taxes, licenses and fees
decreased by $6 million due to reduced premium tax rates on
a portion of the medical premium. Amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs increased by $7 million due to
higher sales of individual health insurance products beginning
in 2000. General expenses increased by $9 million mainly due to
additional spending to improve claims experience. The expense
ratio improved 50 basis points from 29.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to 28.9% for the year ended December 31,
2003.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by
$26 million, or 27%, from $95 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to $121 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Income taxes increased by $15 million, or
31%, from $49 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $64 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. The increase was consistent with the 28% increase in
segment income before income tax during the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared
    to December 31, 2001

Total Revenues

Total revenues remained virtually unchanged from
2001 to 2002, at $1,910 million in 2001 as compared to
$1,912 million in 2002.

Net earned premiums and other considerations also
remained stable from 2001 to 2002, at $1,838 million in
2001 as compared to $1,834 million in 2002, with an
increase of $142 million in 2002 in the net earned premiums
attributable to our individual health insurance products being
offset by a decrease of $146 million during such year in
net earned premiums attributable to our small employer group
health insurance products. Net earned premiums attributable to
our individual health insurance business increased due to
membership growth and premium rate increases. Net earned
premiums attributable to our small employer group health
insurance business decreased due to declining membership,
partially offset by small employer group premium rate increases
that we instituted in selected markets to adequately price for
the underlying medical costs of existing business and for
anticipated future medical trends.



Net investment income decreased by
$3 million, or 5%, from $58 million in 2001 to
$55 million in 2002. There was a 96 basis point decrease in
yield on the investment portfolio from 7.39% in 2001 to 6.43% in
2002 mainly due to the lower interest rate environment.
Partially offset by the decrease in yield was a 7.7% increase in
average allocated invested assets in 2002.

Fees and other income increased by
$9 million, or 64%, from $14 million in 2001 to
$23 million in 2002 due to additional insurance policy fees
and higher fee-based product sales in our individual health
insurance business.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by
$34 million, or 2%, from $1,802 million in 2001 to
$1,768 million in 2002.

Policyholder benefits decreased by
$84 million, or 6%, from $1,306 million in 2001 to
$1,222 million in 2002. This decrease was principally due
to a higher mix of individual health insurance business which
had a lower loss ratio relative to small employer group health
insurance business, primarily due to disciplined pricing and
product design changes. The loss ratio improved 450 basis points
from 71.1% in 2001 to 66.6% in 2002 due primarily to the higher
mix of individual health insurance business, increased premium
rates and product design changes.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $50 million, or 10%, from $496 million in
2001 to $546 million in 2002. Taxes, licenses and fees
increased by $5 million in 2002, or 13%, due to a change in
the mix of business by state and legal entity, and the loss of
favorable consolidated premium tax return benefits triggered by
the disposition of FFG. The amortization of DAC increased by
$21 million in 2002, or 49%, due to higher sales of
individual health insurance products beginning in 2000. General
expenses increased by $34 million in 2002, or 13%, due to
investments in technology, higher employee compensation and
additional spending to achieve loss ratio improvements.
Partially offsetting these increases was a $10 million, or
7%, decrease in commissions due to a higher mix of first year
individual health insurance business. Individual health
insurance policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized in
subsequent years.

The expense ratio increased by 260 basis points
from 26.8% in 2001 to 29.4% in 2002. This increase was primarily
attributable to the higher commissions on the mix of business in
individual health insurance, investments in technology, higher
employee compensation and additional spending to achieve loss
ratio improvements.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by
$24 million, or 34%, from $71 million in 2001 to
$95 million in 2002.

Income taxes increased by $12 million, or
32%, from $37 million in 2001 to $49 million in 2002.
The increase was consistent with the 33% increase in segment
income before income tax in 2002.



Assurant Employee Benefits

Overview

The table below presents information regarding
Assurant Employee Benefits’ segment results of operations:

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared
    to December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues decreased by $5 million, less
than 1%, from $1,455 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to $1,450 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.



Net earned premiums and other considerations
increased by $23 million, or 2%, from $1,233 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$1,256 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
This increase was primarily due to $61 million of
additional disability reinsurance premiums assumed from DRMS.
Partially offsetting this increase was a $23 million
decrease in group life net earned premiums, due to the
non-renewal of certain unprofitable business and less new
business due to continued pricing discipline. In addition,
dental net earned premiums decreased by $15 million, driven
by lower sales and the non-renewal of a large account. This
resulted in an aggregate premium persistency of 79.9% for 2003,
which was unchanged from 2002.

Net investment income decreased by
$8 million, or 5%, from $148 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $140 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. There was a 65 basis point
decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.04% for the
year ended December 31, 2002 to 6.39% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate
environment. Average invested assets increased by 8% from 2002
to 2003.

Fees and other income decreased by
$20 million, or 27%, from $74 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $54 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to
lower fee revenue from CORE due to the sale of PRA.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses, and expenses decreased by
$13 million, or 1%, from $1,367 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $1,354 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits decreased by
$24 million, or 3%, from $945 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $921 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was driven by
favorable development in disability claims and lower claim
volume due to the reduction in dental and group life net earned
premiums. In addition, during the third quarter of 2003, we
completed reserve studies for the group disability, group life,
and group dental products, which concluded that, in the
aggregate, these reserves were redundant. Adjustments were made
to reserves to reflect current mortality and morbidity
experience. In addition, the reserve discount rate on all claims
was changed to reflect the continuing low interest rate
environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a reduction
in reserves of approximately $18 million. The benefits loss
ratio improved from 76.6% in 2002 to 73.3% in 2003. Excluding
the reserve release discussed above, the benefits loss ratio
would have been 74.7% in 2003. This improvement was driven
primarily by favorable disability experience.

Selling, underwriting, and general expenses
increased by $11 million, or 3%, from $422 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002, to $433 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. The expense ratio
increased from 32.3% in 2002, to 33.1% in 2003, primarily due to
a $6.2 million write-down of previously capitalized
software related to our new administration system.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by
$5 million, or 9%, from $57 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 to $62 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Income tax expense increased by $3 million,
or 10%, from $31 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 to $34 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase was consistent with the 9%
increase in segment income before tax.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared
    to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $338 million, or
30%, from $1,117 million in 2001 to $1,455 million in
2002, substantially all of which was attributable to the
acquisition of DBD.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
increased by $299 million, or 32%, from $934 million
in 2001 to $1,233 million in 2002. Excluding the
$299 million increase in net earned premiums due to the



acquisition of DBD, net earned premiums were
unchanged at $934 million from 2001 to 2002, primarily
because new business was offset by non-renewal of certain
unprofitable business. An additional contributing factor was
increased pressure on ancillary employee benefits provided by
employer groups due to increased medical costs. Premium
persistency (excluding the DBD acquisition) decreased by
440 basis points from 84.3% for 2001 to 79.9% for 2002
because of disciplined underwriting and reduced employment in
renewed groups.

Net investment income increased by
$4 million from $144 million in 2001 to
$148 million in 2002 mainly due to the DBD acquisition.
This increase was offset in part by a decrease in investment
yields by 36 basis points from 7.52% in 2001 to 7.16% in 2002
due to the lower interest rate environment.

Fees and other income increased by
$35 million, or 90%, from $39 million in 2001 to
$74 million in 2002 primarily due to a full year of fee
revenue from CORE, which was acquired on July 12, 2001.
CORE fee revenue was $66 million in 2002, as compared to
the half-year of revenue recorded in 2001 of $31 million.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$313 million, or 30%, from $1,054 million in 2001 to
$1,367 million in 2002.

Policyholder benefits increased by
$207 million, or 28%, from $738 million in 2001 to
$945 million in 2002. Excluding the $197 million
increase related to the acquisition of DBD, policyholder
benefits increased by $10 million, or 1%, driven by growth
in group dental premiums. Our loss ratio improved 240 basis
points from 79.0% in 2001 to 76.6% in 2002. Excluding the effect
of the DBD acquisition, the loss ratio in 2002 was 80.1%, which
was higher than in 2001 due to slight deterioration in group
dental and group life experience.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $106 million, or 34%, from $316 million
in 2001 to $422 million in 2002 primarily due to the DBD
and CORE acquisitions. The expense ratio was virtually unchanged
between 2001 and 2002.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by
$16 million, or 39%, from $41 million in 2001 to
$57 million in 2002.

Income taxes increased by $9 million, or
41%, from $22 million in 2001 to $31 million in 2002.
The increase was consistent with the 40% increase in segment
income before income tax.



Assurant PreNeed

Overview

The table below presents information regarding
Assurant PreNeed’s segment results of operations:

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared
    to December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues decreased by $5 million, or
1%, from $727 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $722 million for the year ended December 31,
2003.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
decreased by $9 million, or 2%, from $538 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002, to $529 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was
primarily due to a $10 million decline in our AMLIC channel
which was caused by a 24% drop in new face sales from SCI,
AMLIC’s principal customer.

Net investment income increased by
$4 million, or 2%, from $184 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $188 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. A 8% increase in average invested
assets was offset by a 34 basis point decrease in the
annualized investment yield, which was 6.91% at
December 31, 2002 compared to 6.57% at December 31,
2003. The increase in average invested assets was due to a
larger inforce block of business. The rate decline reduced net
investment income by $10 million over the comparable prior
year period. The decline in yields was due to the lower interest
rate environment and the restructuring of the portfolio in 2002
to improve credit quality.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$17 million, or 3%, from $650 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $667 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.



Policyholder benefits increased by
$8 million, or 2%, from $513 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $521 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. This increase is due to the
increase in business written and other factors. A portion of our
pre-funded funeral insurance policies use a Consumer Price Index
rate credited on policies. The Consumer Price Index rate
increased from 1.97% in 2002 to 2.40% in 2003. This increased
policyholder benefits by $2 million in 2003. In addition,
benefit expense increased $4 million over 2002 levels
related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off
feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to
single pay policies.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $9 million, or 7%, from $137 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002, to $146 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization of DAC and
VOBA expense increased $9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, principally due to a larger in force
block of business. Overall general operating expenses before
deferral of costs declined $2 million over the comparable
prior year period due to expense control. This reduction
includes a $0.7 million charge associated with
restructuring of the sales force in our independent division.
Non deferrable general operating expenses were even with the
prior year.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax decreased by
$14 million, or 28%, from $50 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to $36 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. This decrease was caused primarily by
smaller spreads between investment income earned and the fixed
benefits credited to policyholders, increased growth credited on
the Consumer Price Index block of business and higher
utilization of the early pay off feature.

Income taxes decreased by $8 million, or
30%, from $27 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $19 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, which was consistent with the 28% decrease in segment
income before tax.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared
    to December 31, 2001

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $38 million, or
6%, from $689 million in 2001 to $727 million in 2002.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
increased by $31 million, or 6%, from $507 million in
2001 to $538 million in 2002. The increase was driven by a
$15 million increase in net earned premiums in 2002 in our
AMLIC channel due to an increase in the average size of the
policies sold and increased earned premiums from the independent
channel due to increased sales through expansion of pre-need
counselors. Policy size increased due to a change in packaging
of funerals sold by SCI.

Net investment income increased by
$5 million, or 3%, from $179 million in 2001 to
$184 million in 2002. An 8% increase in average allocated
invested assets in 2002 resulting from the growth in force
policies resulted in additional investment income in 2002.
Offsetting the increase in invested assets was a 34 basis
point decrease in yield on the investment portfolio from 7.25%
in 2001 to 6.91% in 2002 due to the lower interest rate
environment and restructuring of the investment portfolio to
enhance credit quality. The decline in yields reduced investment
income in 2002.

Fees and other income increased by
$2 million, or 66%, from $3 million in 2001 to
$5 million in 2002.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$44 million, or 7%, from $606 million in 2001 to
$650 million in 2002.

Policyholder benefits increased by
$27 million, or 6%, from $486 million in 2001 to
$513 million in 2002. The increase in policyholder benefits
was consistent with the increase in business written, partially
offset by other factors. A portion of our pre-funded funeral
insurance policies uses a Consumer Price Index rate as a growth
rate credited on policies. The Consumer Price Index rate
decreased from 3.36% in 2001 to 1.97% in



2002. This reduced policyholder benefits by
$6 million in 2002. In addition, benefit expense increased
by $3 million from 2001 to 2002 related to higher customer
utilization of an early pay off feature that allows conversion
from limited pay policies to single pay policies.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $17 million, or 14%, from $120 million in
2001 to $137 million in 2002. The primary reason for the
increase was an increase in amortization of DAC and VOBA of
$12 million in 2002, as a result of the increased sales of
single pay policies versus plans paid over a three-, five- and
ten-year period. The acquisition costs on single pay policies
are amortized in the year of issue, thus causing the increase in
expense levels in 2002 over 2001. All other expenses increased
by $5 million in 2002 from 2001 due primarily to the
increase in premiums. Our mix of business has been moving toward
more single pay policies relative to multi-pay policies
increasing our expenses in any given year.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax decreased by
$4 million, or 7%, from $54 million in 2001 to
$50 million in 2002. This was caused primarily by smaller
spreads between our investment yields and rates we credited to
our policyholders. Also, profits were lower due to higher
utilization of the early pay off feature described above and
higher mortality, offset by the lower Consumer Price Index
credited growth.

Income taxes decreased by $2 million, or 7%,
from $29 million in 2001 to $27 million in 2002, which
was largely consistent with the 7% decrease in segment income
before income tax.

Corporate and Other

Overview

The Corporate and Other segment includes
activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net
realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income
earned from short-term investments held and interest income from
excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other
segments. The Corporate and Other segment includes the results
of operations of FFG, from January 1, 2001 to
March 31, 2001 (the period prior to its disposition). The
Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of
deferred gains associated with the sales of FFG and LTC.



The table below presents information regarding
Corporate and Other’s segment results of operations:

As of December 31, 2003, we had
approximately $393 million (pre-tax) of deferred gains that
had not yet been amortized. We expect to amortize deferred gains
from dispositions through 2031. The deferred gains are being
amortized in a pattern consistent with the expected future
reduction of the in force blocks of business ceded to The
Hartford and John Hancock. This reduction is expected to be more
rapid in the first few years after sale and to be slower as the
liabilities in the blocks decrease.

The Corporate and Other segment’s financial
results were affected by the April 2, 2001 sale of FFG.
Below are the results of FFG that have been included in the
Corporate and Other segment from January 1, 2001 through
March 31, 2001.



Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared
    to December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $86 million, or
226%, from $38 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $124 million for the year ended December 31,
2003.

Net investment income increased by
$3 million, or 8%, from $40 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to $43 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Net realized gains (losses) on investments
improved by $120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses
of $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. In 2003, we had other than temporary
impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no
individual impairments of available for sale securities in
excess of $10 million in 2003. Impairments on available for
sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted
of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity investments
in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity
investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown
of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the
effects of other-than-temporary impairments, we recorded an
increase in net realized gains of $55 million.

Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of
businesses decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from
$80 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$68 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This
decrease was consistent with the run-off of the businesses ceded
to The Hartford and John Hancock.

Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by
$11 million, or 100%, from $11 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to zero for the year ended
December 31, 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our
investment in NHP, which resulted in pre-tax gains of
$11 million.

Fees and other income decreased by
$14 million, or 56%, from $25 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $11 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to
$15 million of income recognized in 2002 associated with a
settlement true-up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business
to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to
successful collection of receivables that had been previously
written off.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$216 million, or 125%, from $173 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $389 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
increased by $14 million, or 25%, from $55 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002, to $69 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was
primarily



due to $14 million of consulting and
compensation expenses incurred in 2003, related to our initial
public offering in February 2004.

Distributions on preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts decreased by $5 million, or 4%, from
$118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$113 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We
redeemed $1,250 million of our mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in mid-December 2003,
resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining
$196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
of subsidiary trusts in January 2004. As a result of the early
extinguishment of all the mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts we incurred $206 million of
interest premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003
compared to zero recognized in 2002.

Segment Loss After Tax

Segment loss after tax increased by
$92 million, or 124%, from $74 million in 2002 to
$166 million in 2003. This change was primarily due to the
$206 million of interest premiums incurred related to early
extinguishment of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts, partially offset by the favorable
$120 million change in net realized capital gains
(losses) on investments.

Income tax benefit increased by $38 million,
or 62%, from $61 million in 2002 to $99 million in
2003. The change in the income tax benefit was consistent with
the change in segment loss before income tax. In 2002 we also
recognized the release of approximately $13 million of
previously provided tax accruals, which were no longer
considered necessary based on the resolution of certain domestic
tax matters.

Year Ended
December 31, 2002 Compared to December 31,

Total Revenues

Total revenues decreased by $210 million, or
85%, from $248 million in 2001 to $38 million in 2002.

Net earned premiums and other considerations
decreased by $58 million, or 100%, from $58 million in
2001 to zero in 2002 due to the sale of FFG.

Net investment income decreased by
$72 million, or 64%, from $112 million in 2001 to
$40 million in 2002. Excluding the $32 million
reduction in investment income from the sale of FFG, net
investment income decreased in 2002 as a result of a decrease in
invested assets because we paid down debt and acquired CORE and
DBD.

Net realized losses on investments decreased by
$1 million, or 1%, from $119 million in 2001 to
$118 million in 2002. In 2002, we had other-than-temporary
impairments of $85 million, as compared to $78 million
in 2001. Impairments of available for sale securities in excess
of $10 million in 2002 consisted of an $18 million
writedown of fixed maturity investments in NRG Energy, a
$12 million writedown of fixed maturity investments in
AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown of fixed
maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Impairments of available
for sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2001
consisted of a $22 million writedown of fixed maturity
investments in Enron.

Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of
businesses increased by $12 million, or 18%, from
$68 million in 2001 to $80 million in 2002, mainly due
a to full year of amortization of the deferred gain on the sale
of FFG as compared to nine months of amortization in 2001.

Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by
$51 million, or 82%, from $62 million in 2001 to
$11 million in 2002. This decrease was due to the sale of
FFG’s mutual fund operations. Also, on June 28, 2002,
we sold our investment in NHP, which resulted in pre-tax gains
of $11 million in 2002.

Fees and other income decreased by
$42 million, or 63%, from $67 million in 2001 to
$25 million in 2002. Excluding the $65 million
reduction in other income due to the sale of FFG, fees and other
income increased by $23 million in 2002 mainly due to
approximately $15 million of income associated with a
settlement true- up of a 1999 sale of a small block of business
to a third party and reversal of bad debt allowances due to
successful collection of receivables that had been previously
written off.



Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by
$149 million, or 46%, from $322 million in 2001 to
$173 million in 2002.

Policyholder benefits decreased by
$70 million, or 100%, from $70 million in 2001 to zero
in 2002. The decrease was entirely due to the sale of FFG.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses
decreased by $65 million, or 54%, from $120 million in
2001 to $55 million in 2002. Excluding the $86 million
reduction in selling, underwriting and general expenses
attributable to the sale of FFG, these expenses increased by
$21 million from 2001 to 2002.

Interest expense decreased by $14 million,
or 100%, from $14 million in 2001 to zero in 2002. We used
a portion of the FFG sale proceeds to repay $225 million of
debt owed to Fortis Finance.

Distributions on preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts in 2002 remained unchanged from 2001 at
$118 million.

Segment Loss After Tax

Segment loss after tax increased by
$21 million, or 40%, from a $53 million loss in 2001
to a $74 million loss in 2002, primarily due to the sale of
FFG.

Income taxes increased by $40 million, or
190%, from $21 million in 2001 to $61 million in 2002.
Excluding the $4 million reduction in income tax expenses
due to the sale of FFG, income tax benefit increased by
$44 million in 2002. The change in the income tax benefit
was largely consistent with the increase in segment losses
before income tax. In 2002, we also recognized the release of
approximately $13 million of previously provided tax
accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on the
resolution of certain domestic tax matters.

Investments

The following table shows the carrying value of
our investments by type of security as of the dates indicated:

Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 70%
and 75% (based on total fair value) were invested in securities
rated “A” or better as of December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, respectively. As interest rates
decrease, the market value of fixed maturity securities
increases.



The following table provides the cumulative net
unrealized gains (pre-tax) on fixed maturity securities and
equity securities as of the dates indicated:

Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities
increased by $94 million, or 23%, from December 31,
2002 to December 31, 2003. The increase in net unrealized
gains was primarily due to the decline in investment grade
corporate securities yield spreads combined with an increase in
Treasury yields. Spreads on investment grade corporate
securities fell by approximately 119 basis points while
yields on 10-year Treasury securities increased by 44 basis
points between December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003.

Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities
increased by $246 million, or 155%, from December 31,
2001 to December 31, 2002. This reflected the impact of
declining market interest rates. Yields on 10-year
U.S. Treasury bonds decreased by 121 basis points from
5.03% at December 31, 2001, to 3.82% at December 31,
2002.

Net unrealized gains on equity securities
increased by $12 million, or 171%, from December 31,
2002, to December 31, 2003 and by $3 million, or 75%,
from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002.

Reserves

The following table presents reserve information
as of the dates indicated:

Future policy benefits and expenses increased by
$428 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2002 to
December 31, 2003 and by $260 million, or 5%, from
December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. The main
contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying
business.

Unearned premiums decreased by $74 million,
or 2%, from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 and
by $59 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2001 to
December 31, 2002. The decrease is primarily driven by the
run-off of our credit life and disability contracts, offset by
growth in other short duration contracts.

Claims and benefits payable increased by
$139 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2002 to
December 31, 2003 and increased by $124 million, or
4%, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. The
main contributing factor to these increases was growth in
underlying business.



The following table provides reserve information
by our major lines of business for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002:

For a description of our reserving methodology,
see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this report.

Long Duration

The following discusses the reserving process for
our major long duration product line.

Pre-Funded Funeral Life Insurance

Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded
as the present value of future benefits to policyholders and
related expenses less the present value of future net premiums.
Reserve assumptions are selected using best estimates for
expected investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal
rates. These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on
Company experience and include provision for possible
unfavorable deviation. An unearned premium reserve is also
recorded which represents the balance of the excess of gross
premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized in
future years’ income in a constant relationship to
insurance in force.

Loss recognition testing is performed annually.
Such testing involves the use of best estimate assumptions to
determine if the net liability position (all liabilities less
DAC) exceeds the minimum liability needed. Any premium
deficiency would first be addressed by removing the provision
for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium deficiency still
remains, it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the
statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC.
Any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium
deficiency reserve.



Short Duration

For short duration contracts, claims and benefits
payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The
liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the
claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include
(1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the
balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the
insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of
the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense
reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims.
Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments
to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are
further discussions on the reserving process for our major short
duration products.

Group Disability and Group Term Life

Case or claim reserves are set for active
individual claims on group disability policies and for
disability waiver of premium benefits on group term life
policies. Assumptions considered in setting such reserves
include disabled life mortality and claim termination rates (the
rates at which disabled claimants come off claim, either through
recovery or death), claim management practices, awards for
social security and other benefit offsets and yield rates earned
on assets supporting the reserves. Group long-term disability
and group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted
because the payment pattern and ultimate cost are fixed and
determinable on an individual claim basis.

Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves
include patterns in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim
reporting, and elapsed time from claim reporting to claim
payment.

Key sensitivities for group long-term disability
claim reserves include the discount rate and claim termination
rates. If the discount rate were reduced (or increased) by
100 basis points, reserves at December 31, 2003 would
be approximately $52 million higher (or lower). If claim
termination rates were 10% lower (or higher) than currently
assumed, reserves at December 31, 2003 would be
approximately $38 million higher (or lower).

The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for
group term life waiver of premium reserves. If the discount rate
were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves
at December 31, 2003 would be approximately
$13 million higher (or lower).

As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Group Disability incurred
losses related to prior years were approximately
$53 million more, $3 million less and $7 million
less than the reserves that were previously estimated for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Group Disability reserves are estimated based on claims incurred
in several prior years. The Group Disability reserve deficiency
in 2003, and its related upward revision reflects the result of
reserve adequacy studies concluded in the third quarter of 2003.
Based on results of those studies, reserves were increased by
$44 million, almost all of which was attributable to a
reduction in the discount rate to reflect current yields on
invested assets. The Group Disability reserve redundancies in
2002 and 2001, which were less than 1% of prior year reserves,
arose as a result of our actual claim recovery rates exceeding
those assumed in our beginning-of-year case reserves, after
taking into account an offset of one less year of discounting
reflected in the Company’s end-of-year case reserves.

As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Group Term Life incurred
losses related to prior years were approximately
$93 million, $29 million and $35 million less
than the reserves that were previously estimated for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A
significant portion of the Group Term Life reserve is related to
waiver of premium reserves for disabled claimants. Group Term
Life waiver of premium reserves are estimated based on claims
incurred in several prior years.

Reductions in the Group Term Life reserves
reflected the results of reserve adequacy studies conducted in
the third quarter of 2003. Based on the results of those
studies, reserves were reduced by $59 million. The change
in estimate reflects an increase in the discount rate, lower
mortality rates and higher recovery rates. These changes were
made to reflect current yields on invested assets, and recent
mortality and recovery



experience. Another portion of the Group Term
Life reserve redundancies in all years described above, was
caused by actual mortality rates being lower than assumed in our
beginning-of-year reserves and recovery rates being higher than
assumed in our beginning-of-year waiver of premium reserves. The
remaining redundancy and related downward revision were due to
shorter-than-expected lags between incurred claim dates and paid
claim dates. These amounts were offset by one less year of
discounting reflected in the Company’s end-of-year waiver
of premium reserves.

The conclusion of the reserve studies determined
that, in the aggregate, the reserves were redundant. The reserve
discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the
continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of
these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately
$18 million, which includes $3 million of reserve
release relating to the group dental business.

Medical

IBNR reserves represent the largest component of
reserves estimated for claims and benefits payable in our
Medical line of business, and we use a number of methods in
their estimation, including the loss development method and the
projected claim method for recent claim periods. We use several
methods in our Medical line of business because of the
limitations of relying exclusively on a single method.

A key sensitivity is the loss development factors
used. Loss development factors selected take into consideration
claims processing levels, claims under case management, medical
inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and
product mix. A 1% reduction (or increase) to the loss
development factors for the most recent four months would result
in approximately $22 million higher (or lower) reserves at
December 31, 2003. Our historical claims experience
indicates that approximately 85% of medical claims are paid
within four months of the incurred date.

As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, actual losses incurred in
our Medical business related to prior years were
$58 million, $43 million and $48 million less
than previously estimated for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Due to the short-tail nature
of this business, these developments relate to claims incurred
in the preceding year (i.e., in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively). The redundancies in our Medical line of business,
and the related downward revisions in our Medical reserve
estimates, were caused by our claims developing more favorably
than expected. Our actual claims experience reflected lower
medical provider utilization and lower medical inflation than
assumed in our prior-year pricing and reserving processes. The
differences in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag rates,
medical provider utilization and medical inflation reflect
experience gains, which are recognized in the period the gains
emerge.

None of the changes in incurred claims from prior
years in our Medical line of business, and the related downward
revisions in our Medical estimated reserves, were attributable
to any change in our reserve methods or assumptions.

Property and Warranty

Our Property and Warranty line of business
includes creditor-placed homeowners, manufactured housing
homeowners, credit property, credit unemployment and warranty
insurance and some longer-tail coverages which we no longer
write (e.g. asbestos, environmental, other general liability and
personal accident). Our Property and Warranty loss reserves
consist of case reserves and bulk reserves. Bulk reserves
consist of IBNR and development on case reserves. The method we
most often use in setting our Property and Warranty bulk
reserves is the loss development method. Under this method, we
estimate ultimate losses for each accident period by multiplying
the current cumulative losses by the appropriate loss
development factor. We then calculate the bulk reserve as the
difference between the estimate of ultimate losses and the
current case-incurred losses (paid losses plus case reserves).
We select loss development factors based on a review of
historical averages, and we consider recent trends and business
specific matters such as current claims payment practices.



We may use other methods depending on data
credibility and product line. We use the estimates generated by
the various methods to establish a range of reasonable
estimates. The best estimate of reserves is selected from the
middle to upper end of third quartile of the range of reasonable
estimates.

As set forth in Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, actual losses incurred in
our Property and Warranty lines of business related to prior
years were $13 million less, $2 million more and
$27 million less than previously estimated for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
redundancy in our Property and Warranty lines of business, and
the related downward revisions in our estimated reserves in 2001
occurred mostly in our credit unemployment and credit property
insurance coverages, whereas the other coverages showed
immaterial adjustments to prior years’ incurred losses. The
small deficiency in 2002 largely reflected a shift in the mix of
business away from the credit property and unemployment product
lines. In addition, an increase in the claim frequency of
unemployment contributed to additional development and the small
deficiency experienced in 2002. In 2003, unemployment claim
frequencies stabilized, resulting in a modest redundancy. These
changes reflect experience gains and losses from actual claim
frequencies differing from the best estimate claim frequencies,
and differences in actual versus best estimate paid claim lag
rates. Such gains and losses are recognized in the periods they
emerge.

For the longer-tail Property and Warranty
coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other general
liability and personal accident), there were no changes in
estimated amounts for incurred claims in prior years for all
years.

None of the changes in incurred claims from prior
years, and the related downward revisions in estimated reserves,
was attributable to any change in our reserve methods or
assumptions.

Most of our credit insurance business is written
on a retrospective commission basis, which permits Assurant
Solutions to adjust commissions based on claims experience.
Thus, any adjustment to prior years’ incurred claims in
this line of business is largely offset by a change in
contingent commissions which is included in the selling,
underwriting and general expenses line in the results of
operations.

Reinsurance

The following table sets forth our reinsurance
recoverables as of the dates indicated:

Reinsurance recoverables decreased by
$205 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2002 to
December 31, 2003. We have used reinsurance to exit certain
businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The
reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted
to $2,410 million at December 31, 2003 and
$2,255 million at December 31, 2002.

In the ordinary course of business, we are
involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with
non-affiliated companies. The following table provides details
of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years ended
December 31:



We utilize ceded reinsurance for loss protection
and capital management, business dispositions and, in Assurant
Solutions, for client risk and profit sharing.

Loss Protection and Capital
    Management

As part of our overall risk and capacity
management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks
underwritten by our various business segments, including
significant individual or catastrophic claims, and to free up
capital to enable us to write additional business.

For those product lines where there is exposure
to catastrophes, we closely monitor and manage the aggregate
risk exposure by geographic area, and we have entered into
reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events.

Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which
we are the ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if
the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit
this risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial
condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of
credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of
reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency
and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well
as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the
sharing of risks.

Business Dispositions

We have used reinsurance to exit certain
businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. Reinsurance
was used in these cases to facilitate the transactions because
the businesses shared legal entities with business segments that
we retained. Assets backing liabilities ceded relating to these
businesses are held in trusts, and the separate accounts
relating to FFG are still reflected in our balance sheet.

The reinsurance recoverable from The Hartford was
$1,537 million and $1,558 million as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The reinsurance
recoverable from John Hancock was $873 million and
$697 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. We would be responsible for administering this
business and funding policyholder liabilities in the event of a
default by reinsurers.

Assurant Solutions Segment Client Risk and
    Profit Sharing

The Assurant Solutions segment writes business
produced by its clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers
and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of
such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such
arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the
sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business.

A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions’
reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure
premiums and risk related to business generated by certain
clients to the clients’ captive insurance companies or to
reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership
interest. Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries
share some of the premiums and risk related to client-generated
business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are
not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiary’s
domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary generally obtains
collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the
reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the
outstanding reserves to obtain full financial credit in the
domiciliary state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance
agreements do not relieve us from our direct obligation to our
insured. Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any
reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the
reinsurance agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance
insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our
reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form of
funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the
reinsurance agreements. See “Item 7A —
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk — Credit Risk.”

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as
such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding
company assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our
subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows



depend upon the availability of dividends and
other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries,
such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under
management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay
such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited
by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our
subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to
significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements
and regulations vary from state to state and by type of
insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and
regulations require, among other things, our insurance
subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit
the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the
holding company. Solvency regulations, capital requirements and
rating agencies are some of the factors used in determining the
amount of capital used for dividends. For 2003, the maximum
amount of distributions our subsidiaries could pay under
applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory
approval was $290 million. For a discussion of the various
restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends, see “Item 1 —
Business — Regulation” and
“Item 5 — Market for Registrant’s
Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
of Equity Securities — Dividend Policy.”

Dividends and other interest income paid by our
subsidiaries totaled $99.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, $186.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 and $615.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Figures for 2001 were higher due
to a gain on the sale of FFG. We used these cash inflows
primarily to pay expenses, to perform other acquisitions, to
make interest payments on indebtedness and to make dividend
payments to our stockholders.

The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries
consist of premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the
sales and maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is
primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions,
operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our
subsidiaries’ excess funds in order to generate income.

Historically, Fortis has maintained a
$1 billion commercial paper facility that we have been able
to access (via intercompany loans) for up to $750 million.
We use the commercial paper facility to cover any cash
shortfalls, which may occur from time to time. During 2003, we
accessed $75 million of this facility for 3 days in
connection with the extinguishment of our mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. We had no commercial
paper borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2002.
In 2001, $217 million in commercial paper was issued and
redeemed. There was no outstanding commercial paper at year-end
2001. In connection with our separation from Fortis, we no
longer have access to this facility. In March 2004, we intend to
establish a $500 million commercial paper program, which
will be available for working capital and other general
corporate purposes. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial
paper or other borrowing facilities at the subsidiary level.

In December 2003, we entered into two senior
bridge credit facilities of $650 million and
$1,100 million. The aggregate indebtedness of
$1,750 million under the facility was in connection with
the extinguishment of our mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts.

On January 30, 2004, we entered into a
$500 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of banks arranged by Banc One Capital
Markets, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.,
which will be available for working capital and other general
corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility is unsecured
and is available until February 2007, so long as we are not in
default.

The revolving credit facility contains
restrictive covenants. The terms of the revolving credit
facility also require that we maintain certain specified minimum
ratios or thresholds. As of March 11, 2004 we are in
compliance with all covenants and we maintain all specified
minimum ratios and thresholds.

On February 5, 2004, we received a
$725.5 million capital contribution from Fortis
simultaneously with the closing IPO. The proceeds from that
contribution were used to repay the $650 million of
outstanding indebtedness under the senior bridge credit facility
and $75.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under the
$1,100 million senior bridge credit facility. In addition,
we repaid a portion of the $1,100 million senior bridge
credit facility with $49.5 million in cash. We also
refinanced the remaining amount outstanding under the



$1,100 million senior bridge credit facility
with the proceeds of our $975 million senior note offering
described below.

On February 18, 2004, we issued two series
of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of
$975 million. The first series is $500 million in
principal amount, bears interest at 5.625% per year and is
payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The
second series is $475 million in principal amount, bears
interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single
installment due February 15, 2034.

Interest on our senior notes is payable
semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each
year, commencing August 15, 2004. The senior notes are our
unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other
senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not
redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds from the issuance
of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of our
outstanding indebtedness under our $1.1 billion senior
bridge facility.

At the time of offering our senior notes, we
entered into a registration rights agreement. The registration
rights agreement requires us to file a registration statement
under the Securities Act to permit the exchange of the senior
notes for registered notes having nearly identical terms as the
senior notes or to permit the registered resale of the senior
notes. If we fail to comply with the filing requirements under
our registration rights agreement within certain time periods,
the interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase.

Our qualified pension plan was under-funded by
$60 million at December 31, 2003. In accordance with
ERISA, there is no expected minimum funding requirement for 2004
or 2005. Our nonqualified plan, which is unfunded, had a
projected benefit obligation of $72 million at
December 31, 2003. The expected Company payments to
retirees under this plan are approximately $4 million per
year in 2004 and 2005. Also, our post-retirement plans (other
than pension), which are partially funded with $7 million
of assets, had an accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
of $51 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, the
expected Company payments to retirees and dependents under the
postretirement plan are approximately $1.2 million per year
in 2004 and 2005. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

We estimate that our capital expenditures in
connection with our name change and rebranding initiative will
be approximately $10 million, which we will expense in
2004. We are not currently planning to make any other
significant capital expenditures in 2004 or 2005.

During January 2004 we paid to participants in
the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan an aggregate of
$25 million in connection with the cash-out of all
outstanding Fortis, Inc. incentive rights. See
“Item 11 — Executive
Compensation — Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards.”

In management’s opinion, our
subsidiaries’ cash flow from operations together with our
income and gains from our investment portfolio will provide
sufficient liquidity to meet our needs in the ordinary course of
business.

Cash Flows

We monitor cash flows at both the consolidated
and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated
and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we
use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs.



The table below shows our recent net cash flows:

Cash Flows for the Years Ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

The key changes of the net cash inflow of $347 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003 were net purchases of
fixed maturity securities of $1,929 million, maturities of
these securities of $1,131 million, and issuance of debt in
the amount of $2,400 million. Key changes of the net cash
outflow of $58 million for the year ended December 31,
2002 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of
$1,164 million and maturities of these securities of
$858 million. Key changes of the net cash inflow of
$34 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
the sale of FFG for $385 million in cash and changes in our
revenues and expenses from operating activities as described
above.

At December 31, 2003, we had total debt
outstanding of $1,970 million, as compared to
$1,471 million at December 31, 2002, and
December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2003 this debt
consisted of $1,750 million of two senior bridge credit
facility arrangements, $196 million of mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, and
$24 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. At
December 31, 2002 and 2001 this debt consisted of trust
capital securities, which we classify as mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, and a small amount of
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.

The table below shows our cash outflows for
distributions and dividends for the periods indicated:



Commitments and Contingencies

We have obligations and commitments to third
parties as a result of our operations. These obligations and
commitments, as of December 31, 2003, are detailed in the
table below by maturity date as of the dates indicated:

In December 2003 and January 2004, we redeemed
all of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts for a redemption price equal to their
aggregate liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of redemption and aggregate premium of approximately
$206 million, all of which was expensed in the fourth
quarter of 2003. We entered into the senior bridge credit
facilities described under “Liquidity and Capital
Resources” in connection with these redemptions.

Letters of Credit

In the normal course of business, letters of
credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements.
These letters of credit are supported by commitments with
financial institutions. We had approximately $118 million
and $120 million of letters of credit outstanding as of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2003, we
had an unused $50 million letter of credit facility.

RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Company

Our profitability may decline if we are
    unable to maintain our relationships with significant clients,
    distributors and other parties important to the success of our
    business.

Our relationships and contractual arrangements
with significant clients, distributors and other parties with
which we do business are important to the success of our
business segments. Many of these arrangements are exclusive. For
example, in Assurant Solutions, we have exclusive relationships
with several mortgage lenders



and servicers, retailers, credit card issuers and
other financial institutions through which we distribute our
products. In Assurant Health, we have exclusive distribution
relationships for our individual health insurance products with
IPSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm USAA and Mutual of
Omaha, as well as a relationship with Health Advocates Alliance,
the association through which we provide many of our individual
health insurance products through Assurant Health’s
agreement dated September 1, 2003 with its administrator,
National Administration Company, Inc. The agreement that
provides for our exclusive distribution relationship with IPSI
terminates in July 2004, but may be extended if agreed to by
both parties. We also maintain contractual relationships with
several separate networks of health and dental care providers,
each referred to as a PPO, through which we obtain discounts. In
Assurant PreNeed, we have an exclusive distribution relationship
with SCI. Many of these arrangements have terms ranging from one
to five years. Although we believe we have generally been
successful in maintaining our client, distribution and related
relationships, if these parties decline to renew or seek to
terminate these arrangements, our results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In
addition, we are subject to the risk that these parties may face
financial difficulties, reputational issues or problems with
respect to their own products and services, which may lead to
decreased sales of our products and services. Moreover, if one
or more of our clients or distributors consolidate or align
themselves with other companies, we may lose business or suffer
decreased revenues. A loss of the discount arrangements with
PPOs could also lead to higher medical or dental costs and/or a
loss of members to other medical or dental plans.

For example, Assurant Solutions lost a few
clients over the last three years as a result of bankruptcies
and termination of contracts either by it or its clients;
however, none of the clients lost was significant to its
business. At Assurant Health, client turnover increased slightly
over the last three years from issues related to the slowing
economy, particularly in 2001 through early 2003; however, none
of the clients lost was significant to its business. Similar to
Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits’ client
turnover increased slightly over the last three years from
issues related to the slowing economy, particularly in 2001
through early 2003, such as companies going out of business and
businesses no longer providing benefits; however, none of the
clients lost was significant to its business. Assurant PreNeed
terminated client relationships with three funeral home groups
in 2003 because of profitability issues with the business;
however, none of the clients terminated was significant to its
business.

Sales of our products and services may be
    reduced if we are unable to attract and retain sales
    representatives or develop and maintain distribution
    sources.

We distribute our insurance products and services
through a variety of distribution channels including:
independent employee benefits specialists, brokers, managing
general agents, life agents, financial institutions, funeral
directors, association groups and other third-party marketing
organizations.

We do not distribute our insurance products and
services through captive or affiliated agents except for a small
number of affiliated agents at Assurant Health. Our
relationships with these various distributors are significant
both for our revenues and profits. In Assurant Health, we depend
in large part on the services of independent agents and brokers
and on associations, including Health Advocates Alliance, in the
marketing of our products. In Assurant Employee Benefits,
independent agents and brokers who act as advisors to our
customers, market and distribute our products. Independent
agents and brokers are typically not exclusively dedicated to us
and usually also market products of our competitors. Strong
competition exists among insurers to form relationships with
agents and brokers of demonstrated ability. We compete with
other insurers for sales representatives, agents and brokers
primarily on the basis of our financial position, support
services, compensation and product features. In addition, by
relying on independent agents and brokers to distribute products
for us, we face continued competition from our competitors’
products. Moreover, our ability to market our products and
services depends on our ability to tailor our channels of
distribution to comply with changes in the regulatory
environment. Recently, the marketing of health insurance through
association groups has come under increased scrutiny. An
interruption in, or changes to, our relationships with various
third-party distributors or our inability to respond to
regulatory changes could impair our ability to compete and
market our insurance products and services and materially
adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.



We have our own sales representatives whose role
in the distribution process varies by segment. We depend in
large part on our sales representatives to develop and maintain
client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain
effective sales representatives could materially adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

General economic, financial market and
    political conditions may adversely affect our results of
    operations and financial condition.

Our results of operations and financial condition
may be materially adversely affected from time to time by
general economic, financial market and political conditions.
These conditions include economic cycles such as insurance
industry cycles, levels of employment, levels of consumer
lending, levels of inflation and movements of the financial
markets.

Fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy,
demographics, and legislative and competitive factors also
influence our performance. During periods of economic downturn:

In addition, general inflationary pressures may
affect the costs of medical and dental care, as well as repair
and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines,
increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures
may also affect the costs associated with our pre-funded funeral
insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to
grow with the Consumer Price Index.

Our actual claims losses may exceed our
    reserves for claims, which may require us to establish
    additional reserves that may materially reduce our earnings,
    profitability and capital.

We maintain reserves to cover our estimated
ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with
respect to reported and unreported claims incurred but not
reported as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves,
whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles
(SAP), do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but
instead represent our best estimates, generally involving
actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the
ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of
claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and
circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be
impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency,
judicial theories of liability and other factors. These
variables are affected by both external and internal events,
such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social
perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions
regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability,
emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or
accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes
and claims handling procedures.

Many of these items are not directly
quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve
estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to
reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the
statement of operations of the period in which such estimates
are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently
uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there
can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed
existing claims reserves. During the past three years, we did
not experience substantial deviations in actual claims losses
from reserve estimates previously established. However, future
loss



development could require reserves to be
increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our
earnings in the periods in which such increases are made.

We may be unable to accurately predict
    benefits, claims and other costs or to manage such costs through
    our loss limitation methods, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our profitability depends in large part on
accurately predicting benefits, claims and other costs,
including medical and dental costs, and predictions regarding
the frequency and magnitude of claims on our disability and
property coverages. It also depends on our ability to manage
future benefit and other costs through product design,
underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management
and, in health and dental insurance, negotiation of favorable
provider contracts. The aging of the population and other
demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology
continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Our ability
to predict and manage costs and claims, as well as our business,
results of operations and financial condition may be adversely
affected by: changes in health and dental care practices,
inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs,
clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory
environment, economic factors, the occurrence of catastrophes
and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health and
dental care and the frequency and severity of claims in all our
business segments.

The judicial and regulatory environments, changes
in the composition of the kinds of work available in the
economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also
materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs.
As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors,
claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

As industry practices and legal, judicial, social
and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and
unintended issues relating to claims and coverage may emerge.
These issues could materially adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition by either extending coverage
beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or
size of claims or both. We may be limited in our ability to
respond to such changes, by insurance regulations, existing
contract terms, contract filing requirements, market conditions
or other factors.

In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes
whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits and
obtains much of its profits through interest rate spreads.
Interest rate spreads refer to the difference between the death
benefit growth rates on pre-funded funeral insurance policies
and the investment returns generated on the assets we hold
related to those policies. As of December 31, 2003,
approximately 81% of Assurant PreNeed’s in force insurance
policy reserves related to policies that provide for death
benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit
growth pegged to changes in the Consumer Price Index. In
extended periods of declining interest rates or high inflation,
there may be compression in the spread between Assurant
PreNeed’s death benefit growth rates and its investment
earnings. As a result, declining interest rates or high
inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and our overall financial condition.

Assurant Employee Benefits calculates reserves
for long-term disability and life waiver of premium claims using
net present value calculations based on current interest rates
at the time claims are funded and expectations regarding future
interest rates. If interest rates decline, reserves for open
and/or new claims would need to be calculated using lower
discount rates thereby increasing the net present value of those
claims and the required reserves. Depending on the magnitude of
the decline, this could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
investment income may be lower than that assumed in setting
premium rates.

Catastrophe losses, including man-made
    catastrophe losses, could materially reduce our profitability
    and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
    and financial condition.

Our insurance operations expose us to claims
arising out of catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners,
life and other personal business lines. We have experienced, and
expect in the future to experience,



catastrophe losses that may materially reduce our
profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes can be
caused by various natural events, including hurricanes,
windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather,
fires and epidemics, or can be man-made catastrophes, including
terrorist attacks or accidents such as airplane crashes. The
frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently
unpredictable. Catastrophe losses can vary widely and could
significantly exceed our recent historic results. It is possible
that both the frequency and severity of man-made catastrophes
will increase and that we will not be able to implement
exclusions from coverage in our policies or obtain reinsurance
for such catastrophes.

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a
function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the
area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most
of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners
and other personal lines coverages, which for the year ended
December 31, 2003 represents approximately 24% of our net
earned premiums and other considerations in our Assurant
Solutions segment. In addition, as of December 31, 2003,
approximately 34% of the insurance in force in our homeowners
and other personal lines relates to properties located in
California, Florida and Texas. As a result of our
creditor-placed homeowners insurance product, our concentration
in these areas may increase in the future. This is because in
our creditor-placed homeowners insurance line, we agree to
provide homeowners insurance coverage automatically. If other
insurers withdraw coverage in these or other states, this may
lead to adverse selection and increased utilization of our
creditor-placed homeowners insurance in these areas.

Claims resulting from natural or man-made
catastrophes could cause substantial volatility in our financial
results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially
reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Our
ability to write new business also could be affected. Increases
in the value and geographic concentration of insured property
and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of
claims from catastrophes in the future.

Pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of
$1 million (before the benefits of reinsurance) that we
have experienced in recent years are:

•

total losses of approximately $10 million
    incurred in 2001 in connection with tropical storm Allison;

•

total losses of approximately $12 million
    incurred in 2002 in connection with Arizona wildfires, Texas
    floods and Hurricane Lili; and

•

total losses of approximately $30 million
    incurred in 2003 in connection with various catastrophes caused
    by windstorms, hailstorms, tornadoes, Hurricane Isabel, and
    wildfires in southern California.

In addition, our group life and health insurance
operations could be materially impacted by catastrophes such as
terrorist attacks or by an epidemic that causes a widespread
increase in mortality, morbidity or disability rates or that
causes an increase in the need for medical care. For example,
the influenza epidemic of 1918 caused several million deaths.
Losses due to catastrophes would not generally be covered by
reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to manage these risks depends in part
on our successful utilization of catastrophic property and life
reinsurance to limit the size of property and life losses from a
single event or multiple events, and life and disability
reinsurance to limit the size of life or disability insurance
exposure on an individual insured life. It also depends in part
on state regulation that may prohibit us from excluding such
risks or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in
catastrophe-prone areas. As discussed further below, catastrophe
reinsurance for our group insurance lines is not currently
widely available. This means that the occurrence of a
significant catastrophe could materially reduce our
profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition.

In addition, in Assurant PreNeed the average age
of policyholders is in excess of 70 years. This group is
more susceptible to epidemics than the overall population, and
an epidemic resulting in a higher incidence of mortality could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.



Reinsurance may not be available or
    adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the
    credit risk of reinsurers.

As part of our overall risk and capacity
management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks
underwritten by our various business segments. Market conditions
beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the
reinsurance protection we purchase. For example, subsequent to
the terrorist assaults of September 11, 2001, reinsurance
for man-made catastrophes became generally unavailable due to
capacity constraints and, to the limited extent available, much
more expensive. The high cost of reinsurance or lack of
affordable coverage could adversely affect our results. If we
fail to obtain sufficient reinsurance, it could adversely affect
our ability to write future business.

As part of our business, we have reinsured
certain life, property and casualty and health risks to
reinsurers. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent
of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer
on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance
arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We
are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to
recover amounts due from reinsurers. Our reinsurers may not pay
the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not
pay such recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurer’s
insolvency, underwriting results or investment returns may
affect its ability to fulfill reinsurance obligations.

Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject
to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current
reinsurance facilities and, even where highly desirable or
necessary, we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance
facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are
unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new
reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase
or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we
may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.
Either of these potential developments could materially
adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

We have sold businesses through reinsurance
    that could again become our direct financial and administrative
    responsibility if the purchasing companies were to become
    insolvent.

We have sold businesses through reinsurance ceded
to third parties, such as our 2001 sale of FFG to The Hartford.
The assets backing the liabilities on these businesses are held
in a trust, and the separate accounts relating to the FFG
business are still reflected on our balance sheet. However, we
would be responsible for administering this business in the
event of a default by the reinsurer. We do not have the
administrative systems and capabilities to process this business
today. Accordingly, we would need to obtain those capabilities
in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers
of these businesses. We might be forced to obtain such
capabilities on unfavorable terms, with a resulting material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, under the reinsurance agreement, The
Hartford is obligated to contribute funds to increase the value
of the separate accounts relating to the business sold if such
value declines. If The Hartford fails to fulfill these
obligations, we will be obligated to make these payments.

We are exposed to the credit risk of our
    agents in Assurant PreNeed and our clients in Assurant
    Solutions.

We advance agents’ commissions as part of
our pre-funded funeral insurance product offerings. These
advances are a percentage of the total face amount of coverage
as opposed to a percentage of the first-year premium paid, the
formula that is more common in other life insurance markets.
There is a one-year payback provision against the agency if
death or lapse occurs within the first policy year. There is a
very large producer within Assurant PreNeed and if it were
unable to fulfill its payback obligations, it could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition. However, we have not had any loss experience with
this very large producer to date. In addition, we are subject to
the credit risk of the parties with which we contract in
Assurant Solutions. If these parties fail to remit payments owed
to us or pass on payments they collect on our behalf, it could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For
example, a client with whom we do business has declared
bankruptcy. In the event that this client does not honor its
claims obligation, we would be liable for making payment, which
we estimate to be approximately $37 million, net of
offsetting collateral,



as of December 31, 2003. We would also be
responsible for administering such claims. Probable and
estimable loss contingencies associated with this risk have been
accrued.

A further decline in the manufactured
    housing market may adversely affect our results of operations
    and financial condition.

The manufactured housing industry has experienced
a significant decline in both shipments and retail sales in the
last five years. Manufactured housing shipments have decreased
from approximately 370,000 in 1998 to 130,000 in 2003,
representing a 65% decline. Repossessions are at an all time
high, resale values have been significantly reduced and several
lenders, dealers, manufacturers and vertically integrated
manufactured housing companies have either ceased operations or
gone bankrupt. This downturn in the industry is the result of
several factors, including excess production, aggressive sales
practices, reduced underwriting standards and poor lending
practices. As a result of this downturn, the industry has
experienced consolidation, with the leaders purchasing the
weaker competitors. If these downward trends continue, our
results of operations and financial condition may be adversely
affected.

The financial strength of our insurance
    company subsidiaries is rated by A.M. Best, Moody’s,
    S&P and Fitch, and a decline in these ratings could affect
    our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and
    earnings to decrease.

Ratings have become an increasingly important
factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance
companies. All of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries
are rated by A.M. Best, six of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries are rated by Moody’s and seven of our domestic
operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P and Fitch.
The ratings reflect A.M. Best’s, Moody’s,
S&P’s and Fitch’s opinions of our
subsidiaries’ financial strength, operating performance,
strategic position and ability to meet their obligations to
policyholders. The ratings are not evaluations directed to
investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our
securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by
A.M. Best, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to retain these ratings.

Most of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries have A.M. Best financial strength ratings of A
(“Excellent”), which is the second highest of ten
ratings categories and the highest within the category based on
modifiers (i.e., A and A- are “Excellent”). Our other
domestic operating insurance subsidiaries have A.M. Best
financial strength ratings of A- (“Excellent”), which
is the second highest of ten ratings categories and the lowest
within the category based on modifiers.

The Moody’s financial strength rating is A2
(“Good”) for one of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings
categories and mid-range within the category based on modifiers
(i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are “Good”), and A3
(“Good”) for five of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings
categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers.

The S&P financial strength rating is A
(“Strong”) for five of our domestic operating
insurance subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine
ratings categories and mid-range within the category based on
modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A- are “Strong”), and A-
(“Strong”) for two of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings
categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers.

The Fitch financial strength rating for the seven
rated domestic insurance companies is A (“Strong”)
which is the third highest of twelve rating categories and
mid-range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A,
and A- are “Strong”).

Rating agencies review their ratings periodically
and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. If
our ratings are reduced from their current levels by
A.M. Best, Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, or placed under
surveillance or review with possible negative implications, our
competitive position in the respective insurance industry
segments could suffer and it could be more difficult for us to
market our products. Rating agencies may take action to lower
our ratings in the future due to, among other things: the
competitive



environment in the insurance industry, which may
adversely affect our revenues, the inherent uncertainty in
determining reserves for future claims, which may cause us to
increase our reserves for claims, the outcome of pending
litigation and regulatory investigations, which may adversely
affect our financial position and reputation and possible
changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating
agencies.

As customers and their advisors place importance
on our financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and
compete less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition,
ratings impact our ability to attract investment capital on
favorable terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced
from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moody’s,
S&P or Fitch, our cost of borrowing would likely increase,
our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of
operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.

Contracts representing approximately 18% of
Assurant Solutions’ net earned premiums and fee income for
the year ended December 31, 2003 contain provisions
requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum
A.M. Best financial strength ratings ranging from
“A” or better to “B” or better, depending on
the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts if the
subsidiaries’ ratings fall below these minimum acceptable
levels. Under our ten-year marketing agreement with SCI,
American Memorial Life Insurance Company (AMLIC), one of our
subsidiaries in the Assurant PreNeed segment, is required to
maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of
“B” or better throughout the term of the agreement. If
AMLIC fails to maintain this rating for a period of
180 days, SCI may terminate the agreement. In our Assurant
Health and Assurant Employee Benefits segments, we do not have
any material contracts that permit termination in the case of a
ratings downgrade.

Since January 1, 2000, none of the A.M. Best
ratings for our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries has
been downgraded. On September 25, 2003, the Moody’s
financial strength rating for Fortis Benefits Insurance Company,
one of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, was
downgraded from A1 (“Good”) to A2 (“Good”)
and the financial strength rating for John Alden Life Insurance
Company, another domestic operating insurance subsidiary, was
downgraded from A2 (“Good”) to A3 (“Good”)
in contemplation of the fact that we would no longer be wholly
owned by Fortis. In addition, on May 2, 2003, Moody’s
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Fortis
Benefits Insurance Company from Aa3 (“Excellent”) to
A1 (“Good”) corresponding to the downgrading of
Fortis. These recent downgrades did not have a quantifiable
impact on the business of these subsidiaries primarily because
our operating insurance companies rely solely on the ratings of
A.M. Best for the marketing and sale of their products.

The failure to effectively maintain and
    modernize our information systems could adversely affect our
    business.

Our business is dependent upon our ability to
keep up to date with technological advances. This is
particularly important in Assurant Solutions, where our systems,
including our ability to keep our systems fully integrated with
those of our clients, are critical to the operation of our
business. Our failure to update our systems to reflect
technological advancements or to protect our systems may
adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business
with our clients.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we
have spent approximately $90 million in Assurant Solutions,
$55 million in Assurant Health, $43 million in
Assurant Employee Benefits and $4 million in Assurant
PreNeed to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information
systems. In 2004, we plan to spend for these purposes
approximately $124 million in Assurant Solutions,
$73 million in Assurant Health, $53 million in
Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant
PreNeed.

In addition, our business depends significantly
on effective information systems, and we have many different
information systems for our various businesses. We must commit
significant resources to maintain and enhance our existing
information systems and develop new information systems in order
to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing
technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and
changing customer preferences. As a result of our acquisition
activities, we have acquired additional information systems. Our
failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems,
or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our
information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete
applications, could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. If we do not
maintain



adequate systems we could experience adverse
consequences, including: inadequate information on which to base
pricing; underwriting and reserving decisions; the loss of
existing customers; difficulty in attracting new customers;
customer, provider and agent disputes; regulatory problems, such
as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; litigation
exposure; or increases in administrative expenses.

Our management information, internal control and
financial reporting systems may need further enhancements and
development to satisfy the financial and other reporting
requirements of being a public company.

Failure to protect our clients’
    confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of
    customers, reduction to our profitability and/or subject us to
    fines and penalties.

A number of our businesses are subject to privacy
regulations and to confidentiality obligations. For example, the
collection and use of patient data in our Assurant Health
segment is the subject of national and state legislation,
including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and certain of the activities conducted by
our Assurant Solutions segment are subject to the privacy
regulations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We also have
contractual obligations to protect certain confidential
information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients.
These obligations generally include protecting such confidential
information in the same manner and to the same extent as we
protect our own confidential information. The actions we take to
protect such confidential information vary by business segment
and may include among other things: training and educating our
employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential
information; actively monitoring our record retention plans and
any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance
requirements; drafting appropriate contractual provisions into
any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues;
maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records; and
limiting access to electronic information and maintaining a
“clean desk policy” aimed at safeguarding certain
current information.

In addition, we must develop, implement and
maintain a comprehensive written information security program
with appropriate administrative, technical and physical
safeguards to protect such confidential information. If we do
not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect
confidential information we could experience adverse
consequences, including regulatory problems, loss of reputation
and client litigation.

See “Risks Related to Our
Industry — Cost of compliance with privacy laws could
adversely affect our business and results of operations.”

We may not find suitable acquisition
    candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may
    not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or
    successfully invest in such ventures.

From time to time, we evaluate possible
acquisition transactions and the start-up of complementary
businesses, and at any given time, we may be engaged in
discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new
ventures. While our business model is not dependent upon
acquisitions or new insurance ventures, the time frame for
achieving or further improving upon our desired market positions
can be significantly shortened through opportune acquisitions or
new insurance ventures. Historically, acquisitions and new
insurance ventures have played a significant role in achieving
desired market positions in some, but not all, of our
businesses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance
ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed
on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures
will be successful. The process of integrating any companies we
do acquire or investing in new ventures could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

In addition, implementation of an acquisition
strategy entails a number of risks, including among other
things: inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities;
difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and
cost savings; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings
or cash flow; an increase in our indebtedness; and a limitation
in our ability to access additional capital when needed.

Our failure to adequately address these
acquisition risks could materially adversely affect our results
of operations and financial condition. Although we believe that
most of our acquisitions have been successful and



have not had a material adverse impact on our
financial condition, we did recognize a goodwill impairment of
$1,261 million in 2002 related to an earlier acquisition.

The inability of our subsidiaries to pay
    dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to
    meet our obligations and pay future stockholder
    dividends.

As a holding company whose principal assets are
the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on
dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our
subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and
principal on outstanding debt obligations, dividends to
stockholders (including any dividends on our common stock) and
corporate expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends and to make such other payments in the future will
depend on their statutory surplus, future statutory earnings and
regulatory restrictions. Except to the extent that we are a
creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims
of the subsidiaries’ creditors, including policyholders,
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the
subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors. If any of our
subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise
reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to
proceed against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the
liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under
applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws. The
applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our
insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings
relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that
jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the
subsidiary. Both creditors and policyholders of the subsidiary
would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiary’s
assets before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive
any distribution from the subsidiary.

The payment of dividends to us by any of our
insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e.,
extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the
subsidiary’s domiciliary state department of insurance.
Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is
generally required, are limited to amounts determined by
formula, which varies by state. The formula for more than half
of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is the
greater of (i) 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end
of the prior year or (ii) the prior year’s statutory
net income. In the remaining states in which our subsidiaries
are domiciled, the formula is the lesser amount of
clauses (i) and (ii). Some states, however, have an
additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of
earned surplus. In addition, as part of the regulatory approval
process for the acquisition of ABIG in 1999, we entered into an
agreement with the Florida Insurance Department pursuant to
which, until August of 2004, two of our subsidiaries have agreed
to limit the amount of ordinary dividends they would pay to us
to an amount no greater than 50% of the amount otherwise
permitted under Florida law. Likewise, one of our subsidiaries,
First Fortis Life Insurance Company, entered into an agreement
with the New York Insurance Department as part of the
regulatory approval process for the merger of Bankers American
Life Assurance Company into First Fortis Life Insurance Company
in 2001 pursuant to which it has agreed not to pay any ordinary
dividends to us until fiscal year 2004. See
“Item 1 — Business —
Regulation — United States — State
Regulation — Insurance Regulation Concerning
Dividends.” If insurance regulators determine that payment
of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance
subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing
agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be
adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block
such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior
approval. No assurance can be given that there will not be
further regulatory actions restricting the ability of our
insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Based on the dividend
restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the maximum
amount of dividends that our subsidiaries could pay to us in
2003 without regulatory approval was approximately
$290 million, of which approximately $99.5 million was
paid during 2003. We expect that as a result of, among other
things, statutory accounting for our sold businesses, the
maximum amount of dividends our subsidiaries will be able to pay
to us will be significantly lower in 2004. If the ability of
insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments
to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, it
could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our
common stock and/or service our debt and pay our other corporate
expenses.

Our $500 million senior revolving credit
facility dated as of January 30, 2004 and our Series B
and Series C Preferred Stock also contain limitations on
our ability to pay dividends. See “Item 5 —
Market for



Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
Stockholder Matter and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities — Preferred Stock” and
“— Dividend Policy.”

Risks Related to Our Industry

We face significant competitive pressures
    in our businesses, which may reduce premium rates and prevent us
    from pricing our products at rates that will allow us to be
    profitable.

In each of our lines of business, we compete with
other insurance companies or service providers, depending on the
line and product, although we have no single competitor who
competes against us in all of the business lines in which we
operate. Assurant Solutions has numerous competitors in its
product lines, but we believe no other company participates in
all of the same lines or offers comprehensive capabilities.
Competitors include insurance companies and financial
institutions. In Assurant Health, we believe the market is
characterized by many competitors, and our main competitors
include health insurance companies and the Blue Cross/ Blue
Shield plans in the states in which we write business. In
Assurant Employee Benefits, commercial competitors include
benefits and life insurance companies as well as not-for-profit
Delta Dental plans. In Assurant PreNeed, our main competitors
are two pre-need life insurance companies with nationwide
representation, Forethought Financial Services and Homesteaders
Life Company, and several small regional insurers. While we are
among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many
of our business lines, in some cases there are one or more major
market players in a particular line of business.

Competition in our businesses is based on many
factors, including quality of service, product features, price,
scope of distribution, scale, financial strength ratings and
name recognition. We compete, and will continue to compete, for
customers and distributors with many insurance companies and
other financial services companies. We compete not only for
business and individual customers, employer and other group
customers, but also for agents and distribution relationships.
Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products
than our specific subsidiaries with which they compete in
particular markets, may have a greater diversity of distribution
resources, may have better brand recognition, may from time to
time have more competitive pricing, may have lower cost
structures or, with respect to insurers, may have higher
financial strength or claims paying ratings. Some may also have
greater financial resources with which to compete. As a result
of judicial developments and changes enacted by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, financial institutions are now
able to offer a substitute product similar to credit insurance
as part of their basic loan agreement with customers without
being subject to insurance regulations. Also, as a result of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which was enacted in November 1999,
financial institutions are now able to affiliate with other
insurance companies to offer services similar to our own. This
has resulted in new competitors with significant financial
resources entering some of our markets. Moreover, some of our
competitors may have a lower target for returns on capital
allocated to their business than we do, which may lead them to
price their products and services lower than we do. In addition,
from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which
we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there
are new entrants. For example, several large insurance companies
have recently entered the market for individual health insurance
products. We may lose business to competitors offering
competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons,
which could materially adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

In certain markets, we compete with organizations
that have a substantial market share. In addition, with regard
to Assurant Health, organizations with sizable market share or
provider-owned plans may be able to obtain favorable financial
arrangements from health care providers that are not available
to us. Without our own similar arrangements, we may not be able
to compete effectively in such markets.

New competition could also cause the supply of
insurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our
products at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our
underwriting results. Although there are some impediments facing
potential competitors who wish to enter the markets we serve,
the entry of new competitors into our markets can occur,
affording our customers significant flexibility in moving to
other insurance providers.



The insurance industry is cyclical, which
    may impact our results.

The insurance industry is cyclical. Although no
two cycles are the same, insurance industry cycles have
typically lasted for periods ranging from two to six years. The
segments of the insurance markets in which we operate tend not
to be correlated to each other, with each segment having its own
cyclicality. Periods of intense price competition due to
excessive underwriting capacity, periods when shortages of
underwriting capacity permit more favorable rate levels,
consequent fluctuations in underwriting results and the
occurrence of other losses characterize the conditions in these
markets. Historically, insurers have experienced significant
fluctuations in operating results due to volatile and sometimes
unpredictable developments, many of which are beyond the direct
control of the insurer, including competition, frequency of
occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of
capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. This
may cause a decline in revenue at times in the cycle if we
choose not to reduce our product prices in order to maintain our
market position, because of the adverse effect on profitability
of such a price reduction. We can be expected therefore to
experience the effects of such cyclicality and changes in
customer expectations of appropriate premium levels, the
frequency or severity of claims or other loss events or other
factors affecting the insurance industry that generally could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

The insurance and related businesses in
    which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity,
    which may negatively impact our financial results.

The nature of the market for the insurance and
related products and services we provide is that we interface
with and distribute our products and services ultimately to
individual consumers. There may be a perception that these
purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer
protection. Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocate
groups or the media may focus attention on our products and
services, thereby subjecting our industries to periodic negative
publicity. We may also be negatively impacted if another company
in one of our industries engages in practices resulting in
increased public attention to our businesses. Negative publicity
may result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of
industry practices as well as increased litigation, which may
further increase our costs of doing business and adversely
affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our
products and services, requiring us to change our products or
services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we
operate.

Our business is subject to risks related to
    litigation and regulatory actions.

In addition to the occasional employment-related
litigation to which all businesses are subject, we are a
defendant in actions arising out of, and are involved in various
regulatory investigations and examinations relating to, our
insurance and other related business operations. We may from
time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory
actions relating to our current and past business operations,
including, but not limited to:



In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new
types of legal claims against insurance and related companies.
Current and future court decisions and legislative activity may
increase our exposure to these types of claims. Multiparty or
class action claims may present additional exposure to
substantial economic, non-economic or punitive damage awards.
The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a
significant damage award or a judicial ruling that was otherwise
detrimental, could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition. This risk of potential
liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more
difficult to obtain. We cannot determine with any certainty what
new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be
on our businesses.

There are various governmental and administrative
investigations and proceedings pending against us. For example,
an indictment has been issued in Minnesota alleging that one of
our subsidiaries and two corporate officers of Assurant
Solutions each violated the Minnesota Fair Campaign Practices
Act. The outcome of these investigations and proceedings cannot
be predicted, and no assurances can be given that such
investigations or proceedings or any litigation would not
materially adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, if we were to experience
difficulties with our relationship with a regulatory body in a
given jurisdiction, it could have a material adverse effect on
our ability to do business in that jurisdiction. See
“Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.”

We are subject to extensive governmental
    regulation, which increases our costs and could restrict the
    conduct of our business.

Our operating subsidiaries are subject to
extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in
which they do business. Such regulation is generally designed to
protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to
stockholders and other investors. To that end, the laws of the
various states establish insurance departments with broad powers
with respect to such things as:



•

restricting contact with consumers, such as the
    recently created national “do not call” list, and
    imposing consumer protection measures.

Assurant Health is also required by some
jurisdictions to provide coverage to persons who would not
otherwise be considered eligible by insurers. Each of these
jurisdictions dictates the types of insurance and the level of
coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. Our
share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a
function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line
of insurance in each jurisdiction. Assurant Health is exposed to
some risk of losses in connection with mandated participation in
such schemes in those jurisdictions in which they are still
effective. In addition, HIPAA imposed insurance reform
provisions as well as requirements relating to the privacy of
individuals. HIPAA requires certain guaranteed issuance and
renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and
small groups (generally 50 or fewer employees) and limits
exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. Most of the
insurance reform provisions of HIPAA became effective for plan
years beginning July 1, 1997. See also “Risks Related
to Our Industry — Costs of compliance with privacy
laws could adversely affect our business and results of
operations.”

If regulatory requirements impede our ability to
raise premium rates, utilize new policy forms or terminate, deny
or cancel coverage in any of our businesses, our results of
operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected. The capacity for an insurance company’s growth in
premiums is in part a function of its statutory surplus.
Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured
by statutory accounting practices and procedures, is considered
important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private
agencies that rate insurers’ claims-paying abilities and
financial strength. Failure to maintain certain levels of
statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny
and enforcement, action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade
by rating agencies.

We may be unable to maintain all required
licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply
with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the
relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and
regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively
broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and
approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and
approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory
requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could
preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all
of our activities or monetarily penalize us. That type of action
could materially adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. See “Item 1 —
Business-Regulation.”

Changes in regulation may reduce our
    profitability and limit our growth.

Legislation or other regulatory reform that
increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that
changes the way we are able to do business may significantly
harm our business or results of operations in the future. For
example, some states have imposed new time limits for the
payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care
and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims
not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states
have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional
authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on
health and dental plans engaging in certain “unfair payment
practices.” If we were to be unable for any reason to
comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial
costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Legislative or regulatory changes that could
significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include, but are not
limited to:



State legislatures regularly enact laws that
alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further,
state insurance regulators regularly reinterpret existing laws
and regulations and the NAIC regularly undertakes regulatory
projects, all of which can affect our operations. In recent
years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under
increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have
considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding
companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are
re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically
focusing on modifications to holding company regulations,
interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws.

Although the U.S. federal government does
not directly regulate the insurance business, changes in federal
legislation and administrative policies in several areas,
including changes in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial
services regulation and federal taxation, could significantly
harm the insurance industry and us. Federal legislation and
administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan
regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation
can reduce our profitability. In addition, state legislatures
and the U.S. Congress continue to focus on health care
issues. The U.S. Congress is considering Patients’
Bill of Rights legislation, which, if adopted, would permit
health plans to be sued in state court for coverage
determinations and could fundamentally alter the treatment of
coverage decisions under Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). There recently have been
legislative attempts to limit ERISA’s preemptive effect on
state laws. For example, the U.S. Congress has, from time
to time, considered legislation relating to changes in ERISA to
permit application of state law remedies, such as consequential
and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of
benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for
damages in future litigation. Additionally, new interpretations
of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our
ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on
policies we issued previously.

A number of legislative proposals have been made
at the federal level over the past several years that could
impose added burdens on Assurant Health. These proposals would,
among other things, mandate benefits with respect to certain
diseases or medical procedures, require plans to offer an
independent external review of certain coverage decisions and
establish a national health insurance program. Any of these
proposals, if implemented, could adversely affect our results of
operations or financial condition. Federal changes in Medicare
and Medicaid that reduce provider reimbursements could have
negative implications for the private sector due to cost
shifting. When the government reduces reimbursement rates for
Medicare and Medicaid, providers often try to recover shortfalls
by raising the prices charged to privately insured customers.
State small employer group and individual health insurance
market reforms to increase access and affordability could also
reduce profitability by precluding us from appropriately pricing
for risk in our individual and small employer group health
insurance policies.

In addition, the U.S. Congress and some
federal agencies from time to time investigate the current
condition of insurance regulation in the United States to
determine whether to impose federal regulation or to



allow an optional federal incorporation, similar
to banks. Bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress
from time to time that would provide for a federal scheme of
chartering insurance companies or an optional federal charter
for insurance companies. Meanwhile, the federal government has
granted charters in years past to insurance-like organizations
that are not subject to state insurance regulations, such as
risk retention groups. See “Item 1 —
Business — Regulation — United
States — Federal Regulation — Legislative
Developments.” Thus, it is hard to predict the likelihood
of a federal chartering scheme and its impact on the industry or
on us.

We cannot predict with certainty the effect any
proposed or future legislation, regulations or NAIC initiatives
may have on the conduct of our business. In addition, the
insurance laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to
time may be more restrictive or may result in materially higher
costs than current requirements. See
“Item 1 — Business —
Regulation.”

Costs of compliance with privacy laws could
    adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

The privacy of individuals has been the subject
of recent state and federal legislation. State privacy laws,
particularly those with “opt-in” clauses, can affect
the pre-funded funeral insurance business. These laws make it
harder to share information for marketing purposes, such as
generating new sales leads. Similarly, the recently created
“do not call” list would restrict our ability to
contact customers and, in Assurant Solutions, has lowered our
expectations for growth in our direct-marketed consumer credit
insurance products in the United States.

HIPAA and the implementing regulations that have
thus far been adopted impose new obligations for issuers of
health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental
benefit plan sponsors. HIPAA also establishes new requirements
for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually
identifiable health information and new standards for electronic
health care transactions. The Department of Health and Human
Services promulgated final HIPAA regulations in 2002. The
privacy regulations required compliance by April 2003, the
electronic transactions regulations by October 2003 and the
security regulations by April 2005. As have other entities in
the health care industry, we have incurred substantial costs in
meeting the requirements of these HIPAA regulations and expect
to continue to incur costs to achieve and to maintain
compliance. We have been working diligently to comply with these
regulations in the time periods required. However, there can be
no assurances that we will achieve such compliance with all of
the required transactions or that other entities with which we
interact will take appropriate action to meet the compliance
deadlines. Moreover, as a consequence of these new standards for
electronic transactions, we may see an increase in the number of
health care transactions that are submitted to us in paper
format, which could increase our costs to process medical claims.

HIPAA is far-reaching and complex and proper
interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve.
Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our
business practices to comply with HIPAA are ongoing. Failure to
comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits.
Known and intentional violations of these rules may also result
in federal criminal penalties.

In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires
that we deliver a notice regarding our privacy policy both at
the delivery of the insurance policy and annually thereafter.
Certain exceptions are allowed for sharing of information under
joint marketing agreements. However, certain state laws may
require individuals to opt in to information sharing instead of
being immediately included. This could significantly increase
costs of doing business. Additionally, when final
U.S. Treasury Department regulations are promulgated in
connection with the USA PATRIOT Act, we will likely have to
expend additional resources to tailor our existing anti-fraud
efforts to the new rules.

Risks Related to Our Relationship with and
Separation from Fortis

Fortis will continue to have representation on
our board of directors and influence our affairs for as long as
it remains a significant stockholder.



As of February 5, 2004, Fortis, through
Fortis Insurance N.V., its wholly owned subsidiary, owned
approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock. For as long
as Fortis continues to own shares of common stock representing
more than one-third of the voting power of our outstanding
capital stock entitled to vote on the matter, it will be able to
veto corporate actions requiring a two-thirds vote of our
stockholders. Fortis may have interests that differ from yours
and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be
adverse to your interests.

We have entered into a shareholders’
agreement with Fortis pursuant to which Fortis has the right to
nominate designees to our board of directors and, subject to
limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those
designees as follows: (i) so long as Fortis owns less than
50% but at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, two
designees (out of a maximum of 12 directors); and
(ii) so long as Fortis owns less than 10% but at least 5%
of our outstanding common stock, one designee. Currently, Fortis
has two designees on our board of directors.

In addition, although Fortis has advised us that
it intends to divest all of its shares of our common stock over
a period of time, Fortis is under no obligation to do so.
Subject to the terms of the lock-up agreement described below,
Fortis has the sole discretion to determine the timing of any
such divestiture. See “Item 13 — Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions” for additional
information on lock-up agreements and related party transactions
between our Company and Fortis.

In addition, for so long as Fortis continues to
own less than 50% but at least 10% of our outstanding common
stock, the following will also apply:

•

Our board of directors shall consist of no more
    than 12 directors (including at least seven independent
    directors);

•

Fortis will have the right to nominate two
    designees to our board of directors (out of a maximum of
    12 directors), and the shareholders’ agreement and our
    by-laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, our board
    of directors will nominate those designees; and

•

Pursuant to the shareholders’ agreement, the
    following significant corporate actions may only be taken with
    the approval of Fortis Insurance, as shareholder:

•

any recapitalization, reclassification, spin-off
    or combination of any of our securities or any of those of our
    principal subsidiaries;

or

•

any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or
    commencement of voluntary bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or
    similar proceedings with respect to us or any of our
    subsidiaries.

Because Fortis will control us, conflicts
    of interest between Fortis and us could be resolved in a manner
    unfavorable to us.

Various conflicts of interest between Fortis and
us could arise which may be resolved in a manner that is
unfavorable to us, including, but not limited to, the following
areas:

Stock Ownership.

So
long as Fortis owns shares of common stock representing more
than one-third of the voting power of our outstanding capital
stock entitled to vote on the matter, Fortis will be able to
veto mergers and the sale of all or substantially all of our
consolidated assets. With certain limited exceptions, Fortis,
exercising its rights as a stockholder, can veto a merger or
sale without regard to the interests of the other stockholders.
In addition, the shareholders’ agreement also provides that
for as long as Fortis owns at least 10% of our outstanding
common stock, the following actions may only be taken with the
approval of Fortis Insurance N.V., as stockholder:

•

any recapitalization, reclassification or
    combination of any of our securities or any of those of our
    principal subsidiaries (other than certain activities between
    wholly owned subsidiaries); and



•

any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or
    commencement of voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings
    with respect to us or our principal subsidiaries.

For more information regarding the
shareholders’ agreement, see “Item 13 —
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions —
Shareholders’ Agreement.”

Cross-Directorships.

Michel Baise and Gilbert Mittler are directors of our Company
who are also currently directors and/or officers of Fortis.
Service as both a director of our Company and as a director or
officer of Fortis or ownership interests of directors or
officers of our Company in the stock of Fortis could create or
appear to create potential conflicts of interest when directors
and officers are faced with decisions that could have different
implications for the two companies. Our directors who are also
directors or officers of Fortis will have obligations to both
companies and may have conflicts of interest with respect to
matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us. For
example, these decisions could relate to:

•

disagreement over the desirability of a potential
    acquisition or disposition opportunity; or

•

corporate finance decisions.

Allocation of Business
Opportunities.

Although we do not
expect Fortis to compete with us in the near term, there may be
business opportunities that are suitable for both Fortis and us.
Fortis designees may direct such opportunities to Fortis and we
may have no recourse against the Fortis designees or Fortis. We
have no formal mechanisms for allocating business opportunities.

The loss of the Fortis name in Assurant
    Health, Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant PreNeed may
    affect our profitability.

In connection with our separation from Fortis, we
have changed our name and the names of our business units to
Assurant, Inc. and other Assurant names and have launched a
re-branding initiative pursuant to which we will change our
brand name and most of the trademarks and trade names under
which we conduct our business. The transition to our new name in
each of our business segments and subsidiaries will occur
rapidly in the case of some products and business segments and
over specified periods in the case of other products and
business segments. Under the terms of a license from Fortis, we
have only a limited amount of time to continue to use the Fortis
name. Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant
PreNeed have expended substantial resources to establish the
Fortis name and reputation in the health, employee benefits and
pre-funded funeral insurance marketplace, particularly among
brokers and consultants acting as advisors in the health and
benefits market and with funeral directors in the pre-funded
funeral market. The impact of the change in trademarks and trade
names and other changes (including, without limitation, the name
change) on our business and operations cannot be fully
predicted, and the lack of an established brand image for the
Assurant name in the health, benefits and pre-funded funeral
insurance marketplace may cause a disruption in sales and
persistency and thus affect profitability. Any such disruption
could also cause rating agencies to lower our financial strength
and other ratings in the future. In addition, the costs of
effecting the name change and branding initiative will be
substantial and are currently estimated to be approximately
$10 million. In certain states we may be required to notify
policyholders of our name change and in certain instances new
certificates may need to be issued. This might result in
increased lapses of our insurance policies.

Because Fortis operates U.S. branch
    offices, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the
    Federal Reserve Board under the U.S. Bank Holding Company
    Act (BHCA).

Fortis Bank SA/NV (Fortis Bank), which is a
subsidiary of Fortis, obtained approval in 2002 from state
banking authorities and the Federal Reserve Board to establish
branch offices in Connecticut and New York. By virtue of
the opening of these offices, the U.S. operations of
Fortis, including our operations, became subject to the
nonbanking prohibitions of Section 4 of the BHCA. In order
to continue to operate its U.S. nonbanking operations,
including the insurance activities conducted by our
subsidiaries, Fortis notified the Federal Reserve Board of its
election to be a financial holding company for purposes of the
BHCA and the Federal Reserve Board’s implementing
regulations in Regulation Y. Pursuant to Fortis’
status as a financial



holding company, Fortis and its subsidiaries,
including our subsidiaries, are permitted to engage in
nonbanking activities in the United States that are
“financial in nature” or “incidental to a
financial activity” as defined in Section 4(k) of the
BHCA and in Regulation Y. In particular, Fortis’
status as a financial holding company permits Fortis to engage
in the United States in both banking activities through the
U.S. branches of Fortis Bank and insurance activities
through our subsidiaries. Activities that are “financial in
nature” include, among other things:

•

insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying against
    loss, harm, damage, illness, disability or death, or providing
    and issuing annuities; and

•

acting as principal, agent or broker for purposes
    of the foregoing.

Fortis will continue to qualify as a financial
holding company so long as Fortis Bank remains “well
capitalized” and “well managed” as those terms
are defined in Regulation Y. Generally, Fortis Bank will be
considered “well capitalized” if it maintains tier 1
and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 6% and 10%,
respectively, and will be considered “well managed” if
it has received at least a satisfactory composite rating of its
U.S. branch operations at its most recent examination. As a
general matter, as long as Fortis controls us within the meaning
of the BHCA or owns more than 5% of any class of our voting
shares, the BHCA does not permit us to engage in nonfinancial
activities such as manufacturing, distribution of goods and real
estate development except to the extent that another exemption
under the BHCA, such as the merchant banking exemption, is
available. If the Federal Reserve Board were to determine that
any of our existing activities were not insurance activities or
not otherwise financial in nature or not incidental to such
activities, or if Fortis lost and was unable to regain its
financial holding company status, we could be required to
restructure our operations or divest some of these operations,
which could result in increased costs and reduced profitability.

The Federal Reserve Board oversees all of
Fortis’ direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries for
compliance with the BHCA, including our Company. Our Company
will be considered a subsidiary of Fortis so long as Fortis owns
25% or more of any class of our voting shares or otherwise
controls us within the meaning of the BHCA. In addition, even if
we are not a subsidiary of Fortis, the nonfinancial activities
restrictions of the BHCA and Regulation Y (discussed above)
would continue to apply so long as Fortis owned more than 5% of
any class of our voting shares and another BHCA exemption, such
as the merchant banking exemption, is not available.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

Applicable laws and our certificate of
    incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business
    combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best
    interests.

State laws and our certificate of incorporation
and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a
takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their
best interests. For instance, they may prevent our stockholders
from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price
of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context.
Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of
these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market
price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging
takeover attempts in the future.

State laws and our certificate of incorporation
and by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to
replace or remove our directors. These provisions may facilitate
the entrenchment of directors, which may delay, defer or prevent
a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests
of our stockholders.

The following provisions included in our
certificate of incorporation and by-laws have anti-takeover
effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that
our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In
particular, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:

•

permit our board of directors to issue one or
    more series of preferred stock;

•

divide our board of directors into three classes;

•

limit the ability of stockholders to remove
    directors;



In addition, Section 203 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability
of an “interested stockholder” to engage in business
combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to
include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting
stock.

Applicable insurance laws may make it
    difficult to affect a change of control of our
    Company.

Before a person can acquire control of a
U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be
obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the
domestic insurer is domiciled. Generally, state statutes provide
that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any
person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the
power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the
voting securities of the domestic insurer. However, the State of
Florida, in which certain of our insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, defines control as 5% or more. Because a person
acquiring 5% or more of shares of our common stock would
indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our
Florida subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of
Florida would apply to such transaction and at 10%, the laws of
many other states would likely apply to such a transaction.
Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control
of a domestic insurer, a state insurance commissioner will
typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the
applicant, the integrity of the applicant’s board of
directors and executive officers, the applicant’s plans for
the future operations of the domestic insurer and any
anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of
the acquisition of control.

Our stock and the stocks of other companies
    in the insurance industry are subject to stock price and trading
    volume volatility.

From time to time, the stock price and the number
of shares traded of companies in the insurance industry
experience periods of significant volatility. Company-specific
issues and developments generally in the insurance industry and
in the regulatory environment may cause this volatility. Our
stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and
factors, including:



In addition, broad market and industry
fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our
common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As a provider of insurance products, effective
risk management is fundamental to our ability to protect both
our customers’ and stockholders’ interests. We are
exposed to potential loss from various market risks, in
particular interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally, we
are exposed to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign
currency risk.

Interest rate risk is the possibility that the
fair value of liabilities will change more or less than the
market value of investments in response to changes in interest
rates, including changes in the slope or shape of the yield
curve and changes in spreads due to credit risks and other
factors.

Credit risk is the possibility that
counterparties may not be able to meet payment obligations when
they become due. We assume counterparty credit risk in many
forms. A counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or
other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a
liability or obligation to us. Primarily, our credit risk
exposure is concentrated in our fixed income investment
portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our reinsurance
recoverables.

Inflation risk is the possibility that a change
in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings.
This typically happens when only one of invested assets or
liabilities is indexed to inflation.

Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that
changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings
and equity when measured in domestic currency. This risk is
largest when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency
are invested in financial instruments of another currency. Our
general principle is to invest in assets that match the currency
in which we expect the liabilities to be paid.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk arises as we invest
substantial funds in interest-sensitive fixed income assets,
such as fixed maturity investments, mortgage-backed and
asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage loans, primarily
in the United States and Canada. There are two forms of interest
rate risk — price risk and reinvestment risk. Price
risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct
impact on the market valuation of these investments. As interest
rates rise, the market value of these investments falls, and
conversely, as interest rates fall, the market value of these
investments rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in
interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. As interest rates
fall, an increase in prepayments on these assets results in
earlier than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us to
reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate
environment, and conversely as interest rates rise, a decrease
in prepayments on these assets results in later than expected
receipt of cash flows forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a
favorable higher interest rate environment. As of
December 31, 2003, we held $8,729 million of fixed
maturity securities at fair market value and $933 million
of commercial mortgages at amortized cost for a combined total
of 88% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2002,
we held $8,036 million of fixed maturity securities at fair
market value and $842 million of commercial mortgages at
amortized cost for a combined total of 88% of total invested
assets.

We expect to manage interest rate risk by
selecting investments with characteristics such as duration,
yield, currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash
outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance
liabilities.

Our group long-term disability reserves are also
sensitive to interest rates. Group long-term disability reserves
are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation interest
rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by taking into
consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset
portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses and
provisions for adverse deviation.



The interest rate sensitivity of our fixed
maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical test
scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel
shifts of the underlying yield curves. We have assumed that both
the United States and Canadian yield curves have a 100%
correlation and, therefore, move together. The individual
securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation
model. For investments such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed
securities, a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a
valuation model. Our actual experience may differ from the
results noted below particularly due to assumptions utilized or
if events occur that were not included in the methodology. The
following table summarizes the results of this analysis for
bonds, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities held in our
investment portfolio:

Interest Rate Movement Analysis

of Market Value of Fixed Maturity Securities
Investment Portfolio

As of December 31, 2003

Credit Risk

We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a
holder of fixed income securities and by entering into
reinsurance cessions.

Our risk management strategy and investment
policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality
issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect
to any one issuer. We attempt to limit our credit exposure by
imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers
based upon credit quality. Currently our portfolio limits are
1.5% for issuers rated AA-and above, 1% for issuers rated A- to
A+, 0.75% for issuers rated BBB- to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers
rated BB- to BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for
certain issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance
agreements. We use the lower of Moody’s or
Standard & Poor’s ratings to determine an
issuer’s rating. See “Item 1 —
Business — Investments.”

The following table presents our fixed maturity
investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized
securities rating organizations as of December 31, 2003:

We are also exposed to the credit risk of our
reinsurers. When we reinsure, we are still liable to our
insureds regardless of whether we get reimbursed by our
reinsurer. As part of our overall risk and capacity management
strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten
by our various business segments as described above under
“— Reinsurance.”

For at least 50% of our $4,445 million of
reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2003, we are
protected from the credit risk by using some type of risk
mitigation mechanism such as a trust, letter of credit or by
withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or
co-funds-withheld arrangement. For example, reserves of
$1,537 million and $873 million as of
December 31, 2003 relating to two large coinsurance
arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively,
related to sales of businesses. If the value of



the assets in these trusts decreases, The
Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be, will be required
to put more assets in the trusts. We may be dependent on the
financial condition of The Hartford and John Hancock, whose
A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++, respectively.
For recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms, we
are dependent solely on the credit of the reinsurer.
Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer becomes
questionable. See “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Risk Factors —
Risks Related to Our Company — Reinsurance may not be
available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are
subject to the credit risk of reinsurers.”

Inflation Risk

Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial
funds in nominal assets, which are not indexed to the level of
inflation, whereas the underlying liabilities are indexed to the
level of inflation. Approximately 16% of Assurant PreNeed’s
insurance policies with reserves of approximately
$391 million as of December 31, 2003 have death
benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the Consumer Price
Index. In times of rapidly rising inflation, the credited death
benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the
investment income earned on the nominal assets resulting in an
adverse impact on earnings. We have partially mitigated this
risk by purchasing a contract with payments tied to the Consumer
Price Index. See “— Derivatives.”

In addition, we have inflation risk in our
individual and small employer group health insurance businesses
to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation, and we
have not been able to increase premiums to keep pace with
inflation.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk
arising from our international operations mainly in Canada. We
also have limited foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies
other than the Canadian dollar, primarily British pounds and
Danish krone. Total invested assets denominated in these other
currencies were less than 1% of our total invested assets at
December 31, 2003.

Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching
our liabilities under insurance policies that are payable in
foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such
currency. We have not established any hedge to our foreign
currency exchange rate exposure.

We assess our foreign exchange risk by examining
the foreign exchange rate exposure of the excess of invested
assets over the statutory reserve liabilities denominated in
foreign currency. Two stress scenarios are examined.

The first scenario assumes a hypothetical 10%
immediate change in the foreign exchange rate.

The second scenario assumes a more severe 2.33
standard deviation event (comparable to a one in 100 probability
under a normal distribution).

The modeling techniques we use to calculate our
exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign
currency exchange rates or correlation among various markets.
Our actual experience may differ due to correlation assumptions
utilized or if events occur that were not included in the
methodology, such as significant illiquidity or other market
events.

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments whose
values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates,
financial indices or the prices of securities or commodities.
Derivative financial instruments may be exchange-traded or
contracted in the over-the-counter market and include swaps,
futures, options and forward contracts.

Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies
may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or
anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate
cash market instruments or for certain income-generating
activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of
derivatives for speculative purposes. We generally do not use
derivative financial instruments.



On August 1, 2003, we purchased a contract
to partially hedge the inflation risk exposure inherent in some
of our pre-funded funeral insurance policies. See
“— Inflation risk.”

In 2003, we determined that the modified
coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an embedded
derivative. In accordance with DIG B36, we bifurcated the
contract into its debt host and embedded derivative (total
return swap) and recorded the embedded derivative at fair value
on the balance sheet. Contemporaneous with the adoption of
DIG B36, we transferred the invested assets related to this
coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale
to trading securities, included in other investments in the
December 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet. The
combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net
impact in the consolidated statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of December 31, 2003. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of that date in providing a
reasonable level of assurance that information we are required
to disclose in reports we file or furnish under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods in SEC rules and forms.
Further, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information
required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Composition of Board of Directors

Our by-laws provide that our board of directors
shall consist of such number of directors as from time to time
fixed exclusively by resolution of the board of directors.
However, our certificate of incorporation and the
shareholders’ agreement that we entered into with Fortis
Insurance N.V. provide that for so long as Fortis owns at least
10% of our outstanding common stock, our board of directors
shall consist of no more than 12 directors (including at
least seven independent directors at such time as is required by
the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange). The
current board of directors consists of twelve persons and is
divided into three classes. There are currently three vacancies
arising from the resignations of three Fortis designees. Each
director will serve a three year term, with termination
staggered according to class, except that Class I Directors
have an initial term expiring in 2005 and Class II
Directors have an initial term expiring in 2006. The
classification and current term of office of each of our
directors has been noted in the table listing our board of
directors under “— Directors.”

Pursuant to the shareholders’ agreement that
we entered into with Fortis Insurance N.V., Fortis has the right
to nominate designees to our board of directors and, subject to
limited exceptions, our board of directors will nominate those
designees as follows: (i) so long as Fortis owns at least
10% of our outstanding common stock, two designees (out of a
maximum of 12 directors); and (ii) so long as Fortis
owns less than 10% but at least 5% of our outstanding common
stock, one designee. Currently, Fortis has two designees on our
board of directors, consisting of Messrs. Baise and
Mittler. Fortis has agreed to cause the appropriate number of
Fortis designees to resign promptly at any time when the number
of Fortis designees on our board of directors exceeds the number
of designees to which Fortis is entitled, unless otherwise
requested by us.

common stock and other equity securities of the Company.
Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders

Section 16(a) reports they file.

Because we were not subject to the reporting
obligations under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during

changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities
of the Company were required to be filed in fiscal year 2003.

Option Grants in 2003

The following table presents information
concerning stock options granted pursuant to the
Assurant, Inc. Stock Option Plan to acquire shares of
Assurant, Inc.’s Series D Preferred Stock to the
named executive officers during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2003. The Stock Option Plan was terminated
effective as of September 22, 2003, and all stock options
outstanding thereunder were cancelled in exchange for a payment
of the fair value of such options, as determined by an
independent third party. Such payment totaled approximately
$2.2 million for all outstanding stock options.

(1)

The options were granted pursuant to the
    Assurant, Inc. Stock Option Plan to acquire shares of
    Assurant, Inc.’s Series D Preferred Stock, the
    value of which is related to the market value of shares of
    Fortis N.V. and Fortis SA/NV and the Euro to U.S. dollar
    conversion rate. The options had a term of ten years and were
    scheduled to vest as to one-third of the shares on the first
    three anniversaries of the date of grant.

(2)

There was no public market for shares of
    Assurant, Inc.’s Series D Preferred Stock on the
    grant date. The estimated present values for the options listed
    above are based on the binomial values of the options calculated
    as of September 22, 2003 by an independent third party,
    using the following assumptions: (i) the value of one share
    of Series D Preferred Stock is the sum of the value of 0.9
    of one share of Fortis SA/NV and 0.9 of one share of common
    stock of Fortis N.V., (ii) the exercise price of the option
    was equal to the fair market value as of the date of grant,
    (iii) the stock price equals the average of the combined
    Fortis N.V./ Fortis SA/ NV share price for the three months
    prior to the calculation; (iv) volatility was calculated as
    the average of the 60-month historical volatility of the Fortis
    SA/NV and Fortis N.V. shares at the date of calculation;
    (v) the annual dividend was calculated as the average of
    the Fortis SA/NV and Fortis N.V. stock dividend, and
    (vi) the discount rate was based on the Euro benchmark
    yield curve for the outstanding term of each option. Although
    this calculation is not necessarily the value of the options as
    of their date of grant, it is the value for which they were
    cashed out, as discussed above.



Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards

The following table presents information
concerning long-term incentive plan awards to the named
executive officers under the Assurant Appreciation Incentive
Rights Plan during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003:

    incentive rights and 25% of his or her award in operating
    business segment incentive rights. Conversely, an eligible
    employee of an operating business segment of Assurant receives
    25% of his or her award in Assurant, Inc. incentive rights
    and 75% of his or her award in operating business segment

    the appreciation in value of an incentive right over the vesting
    period of the award, based on a valuation provided by an
    independent, qualified appraiser.

    public offering.

Pension Plans

We maintain two executive defined benefit pension
plans, each of which is inter-related with our broad-based,
tax-qualified, defined benefit pension plan.

Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan.

Effective January 1, 1990,
our board of directors adopted the Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (SERP), which is a non-qualified, unfunded
supplemental pension plan for certain key executives of the
Company and its subsidiaries. Under the SERP, participants who
meet certain conditions are entitled to receive a benefit,
called a “target benefit,” that is then offset
(reduced) by certain other benefits, such as the pension payable
under our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (the
Assurant Pension Plan, described below), the benefit payable
under the pension portion of the Executive Pension and 401(k)
Plan, described below, and Social Security benefits. If the SERP
benefit commences at age 60 or later, the target benefit,
expressed as a single life annuity, is 50% of the
employee’s base pay plus target short-term incentive bonus,
each as most recently approved by our board of directors,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
employee’s number of months of employment with the Company
or its subsidiaries, and the denominator of which is 240. In
other words, after 20 years of employment, the employee
will earn a full 50% benefit under this plan. If the SERP
benefit commences prior to age 60, then the target benefit
will be reduced on an actuarially equivalent basis from
age 60 to the date the benefit actually commences.

A participant is not vested in any of his or her
benefit under the SERP until the second anniversary of the date
he or she commences participation in the plan. On the second
anniversary of participation, the participant vests in the SERP
benefit at the rate of 3% for each month of employment
thereafter with the Company or its



subsidiaries. A participant will become 100%
vested in his or her SERP benefit in the event of death or
disability. If a participant is terminated for cause, as defined
in the SERP, or commits a material breach of certain covenants
regarding non-competition, confidentiality, non-solicitation of
employees or non-solicitation of customers, then the participant
will forfeit any remaining SERP benefits.

The default form of payment under the SERP is a
single lump payment that is the actuarial equivalent of the SERP
benefit. The participant may also elect optional forms of
payment under the SERP.

If there is a change in control with respect to
the Company or a division, and within two years after the change
in control a participant’s employment is terminated without
cause or the participant terminates employment for good reason,
then (1) the participant will become 100% vested in his or
her SERP benefit; (2) the participant will be credited with
36 additional months of service for purposes of computing his or
her target benefit; and (3) the actuarial reduction for
commencement of the SERP benefit prior to age 60 will be
calculated as though the participant was 36 months older
than his or her actual age.

The SERP provides that if the payments to a
participant or beneficiary will be made over a period of more
than one year and if at the time payments commence the Company
is not subject to pending proceedings as a debtor under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then Fortis Insurance N.V. will
guarantee the payment of SERP benefits to such participant or
beneficiary. The SERP further provides that if Fortis Insurance
N.V. ceases to be the beneficial owner of the Company, then such
guarantee will be limited to the actuarially equivalent value of
the participant’s SERP benefit immediately following such
cessation of beneficial ownership.

The table below shows the target benefit payable
under the SERP. The benefit shown is a single life annuity
commencing at age 60.

Target Benefits Payable Under the
Assurant, Inc. SERP

(1)

At December 31, 2003, J. Kerry Clayton had
    33.2 years of service and SERP compensation of $1,622,400;
    Robert B. Pollock had 22.6 years of service and SERP
    compensation of $1,200,650; Lesley Silvester had 19.3 years
    of service and SERP compensation of $713,790; Benjamin M.
    Cutler had 18.1 years of service and SERP compensation of
    $758,505; and Philip Bruce Camacho had 4.4 years of service
    and SERP compensation of $840,000.

Executive Pension and 401(k)
Plan.

Effective January 1, 1994,
our board of directors adopted the Executive Pension and 401(k)
Plan, which is a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation
plan for certain key executives of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The pension portion of this plan (referred to
herein as the Executive Pension Plan) is intended to restore to
participants amounts that they are restricted from receiving
under the Assurant Pension Plan, described below, due to
section 401(a)(17) of the U.S. tax code, which
generally limits the compensation that may be taken into account
under a tax-qualified pension plan to no more than $200,000
annually (subject to cost of living adjustments).

A participant becomes vested in the benefits
under the Executive Pension Plan after three years of vesting
service, if the participant has elected to participate in the
pension equity portion of the Assurant Pension Plan



and after five years of vesting service if the
participant has elected to participate in the pension formula
that predated the pension equity formula under the Assurant
Pension Plan. The benefits under the Executive Pension Plan are
payable in a single lump sum in cash as soon as practicable
after the participant terminates employment, unless exchanged
for options under the Assurant Investment Plan.

Assurant Pension
Plan.

Since 1983, we have maintained
the Assurant Pension Plan, which is a tax-qualified, defined
benefit pension plan subject to regulation under ERISA. Eligible
employees generally may participate in the Plan after completing
one year of service with the Company. The Assurant Pension Plan
provides for multiple benefit formulas for different groups of
participants. Benefits under the plan are payable at termination
of employment. A participant’s benefit may be paid in a
lump sum or in various annuity forms.

Employment and Change in Control
Agreements

We have entered into change in control severance
agreements with Mr. Clayton, our other named executive
officers and other officers and key employees. The severance
agreements generally provide that if a change in control (as
defined) occurs with respect to the business segment for which
an employee works, then a two-year trigger period begins. If the
employee’s employment is terminated by us without cause or
if the employee resigns for good reason (each as defined) during
such two-year period, the employee is entitled to certain cash
severance payments and continuation of medical and other welfare
benefits for a period of 18 months following the
termination of employment at the rate charged active employees.

The amount of cash severance benefits payable to
an employee is equal to a multiple (ranging from
1 to 3 depending on the agreement, and equal to
3 for Mr. Clayton and our other named executive
officers) times the sum of the employee’s annual base
salary and target annual bonus. One-half of the cash severance
is payable within thirty days of the date of the employee’s
termination, and one-half of the cash severance is payable in
equal monthly installments over a period ranging from six months
(for those with a severance multiple of 1) to
18 months (for those with a severance multiple of 3),
offset by the amount of pre-tax compensation earned by the
executive during such period. In addition, if a change in
control has occurred and the employee’s employment has been
terminated by us without cause or if the employee has resigned
for good reason within one year prior to the change in control,
then the employee is entitled to the cash severance benefits
described above, to be paid in a lump sum in cash within
30 days after the change in control has occurred, and
continuation of medical and other welfare benefits for a period
of 18 months at the rate charged active employees, except
that we shall reimburse the employee for the cost of obtaining
such welfare benefits between the date of his or her termination
and the date of the change in control. These agreements also
provide additional rights including, but not limited to,
outplacement services, legal fee reimbursement and reimbursement
for any excise tax imposed on the officer by section 4999
of the U.S. tax code.

American Bankers Insurance Group has a severance
agreement with Mr. Camacho. If Mr. Camacho terminates
his employment because of retirement (as determined in
accordance with normal company policies) or death, then
Mr. Camacho will receive a severance payment equal to 150%
of his current salary, defined as his salary for the
12 months preceding the severance, excluding any bonus or
deferred compensation. If Mr. Camacho’s employment is
terminated because of disability, then Mr. Camacho will
receive a severance payment equal to 50% of his current annual
salary, as defined above. If either Mr. Camacho’s
employment is terminated without cause (as defined in the
agreement), or Mr. Camacho terminates employment after a
decrease in his base salary to a level less than 80% of the
level for any prior year, then Mr. Camacho will receive a
severance payment equal to 100% of his current salary, as
defined. In each case the severance benefit will be paid in a
lump sum on the fifth business day following termination of
employment.

Director Compensation

Our board of directors adopted, and our sole
stockholder prior to our initial public offering approved, the
Assurant Directors Compensation Plan, as amended on
December 12, 2003, effective following our initial public
offering. The purpose of the plan is to attract, retain and
compensate highly qualified individuals for service as members
of the board of directors by providing them with competitive
compensation and an



ownership interest in our common stock. Directors
who are employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates, or of Fortis Insurance N.V. or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates, and directors who are designated by
Assurant to serve as directors pursuant to the
shareholders’ agreement between the Company and Fortis
Insurance N.V., are not eligible to participate in the plan or
to receive payment for service as a director.

The plan provides for payment of an annual
retainer to our non-employee directors of $35,000, payable in
cash quarterly. Additional annual retainers will be paid to the
Chairman of the Board and committee members and chairpersons as
follows: Chairman of the Board: $7,500; Audit Committee: member
$3,750, chairperson $7,500; Compensation Committee: member
$2,500, chairperson $5,000; Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee: member $2,500, chairperson $5,000; Executive
Committee: none. Annual service for this purpose relates to the
approximate 12-month periods between annual meetings of our
stockholders. A prorated retainer will be paid to any person who
becomes a non-employee director other than by election at an
annual meeting. The plan also provides for the payment of
participation fees of $2,000 for each board or committee meeting
and $500 for each board or committee conference call (but not
more than one fee for meetings or conference calls held on the
same day). The Chairman of the Board or chairperson of a
committee may authorize the full meeting fee to be payable with
respect to any extended conference call or any other special
off-site meeting required as part of a director’s service.
The plan provides for reasonable reimbursement of travel
expenses in connection with attending meetings of our board and
its committees, and other company functions where the
director’s attendance is requested by our Chief Executive
Officer. A participant may elect to defer any cash amounts
payable under the Directors Compensation Plan into the Assurant
Investment Plan.

In addition to cash compensation, the plan
provides that each non-employee director will receive, on the
later of the effective date of the plan or the first date he or
she becomes a non-employee director, an initial award of
(1) shares of our common stock having a grant date value
equal to the normal (non-prorated) annual cash retainer amount
for such year, excluding any retainer related to a committee
member or chairperson assignment, and (2) stock
appreciation rights with respect to an equal number of shares of
common stock. On the day following each annual meeting of our
stockholders, beginning in 2005, each non-employee director then
in office (other than a director who first became a non-employee
director at the stockholders meeting held on the previous day)
will receive (1) an award of stock having a grant date
value equal to the director’s annual cash retainer for such
year, excluding any retainer earned by the director as a
committee member or chair, and (2) an award of stock
appreciation rights with respect to an equal number of shares of
common stock. In no event will a director receive both an
initial award and an annual award of shares and stock
appreciation rights for the same year of service. The stock
appreciation rights granted under the plan will have a base
value equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the
date of grant. Upon exercise of a stock appreciation right, a
director will receive a cash payment equal to the excess, if
any, of the fair market value of one share of our common stock
on the date of exercise over the base value of the right. Stock
appreciation rights granted under the plan will be fully vested
on the date of grant, but may not be exercised until the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant. To the extent not previously
exercised, such rights will be automatically exercised on the
earlier of the first anniversary of the grantee’s
termination as a director of the Company for any reason or the
tenth anniversary of the date of grant.

Subject to adjustment for recapitalization
events, the maximum number of shares of our common stock that
may be issued under the Directors Compensation Plan is 500,000.
The plan will remain in effect until the day following the 2013
annual meeting of our stockholders, unless terminated earlier by
our board of directors. The board of directors may at any time
terminate or amend the plan, but any such amendment would be
subject to stockholder approval if, in the reasonable judgment
of the board, the amendment would constitute a material change
requiring stockholder approval under applicable laws or the
applicable requirements of a stock exchange on which our stock
is listed.

Consulting Agreement and Retirement
Plan

Effective July 31, 2000, Mr. Freedman
retired as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In
connection with his retirement, Mr. Freedman entered into a
Consulting, Non-Compete and Payments Agreement with us and
Fortis Insurance N.V. pursuant to which he agreed to
(1) perform consulting services



for the Company for a period of three years from
and after July 31, 2000, and (2) refrain from certain
activities that would be in competition with the Company, which
includes refraining from encouraging, soliciting or inducing any
officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries to enter
into an employment relationship with any entity whose business
activities are in competition with those of the Company for a
period of five years ending July 31, 2005. Pursuant to the
terms of this agreement, Mr. Freedman has received total
payments of $2,491,000 and is entitled to one additional payment
of $607,000 on August 1, 2004, and reimbursement of any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing his
consulting services.

On July 19, 1999, Mr. Freedman entered
in to a Retirement Agreement with us and Fortis Insurance N.V.
relating to the payments and benefits to be provided to
Mr. Freedman in connection with his scheduled retirement on
July 31, 2000. The agreement provided that: as of the date
of Mr. Freedman’s retirement of July 31, 2000,
Mr. Freedman would be fully vested in all amounts earned
under our long term incentive plan. The amounts due
Mr. Freedman under the long term incentive plan could be
deferred by Mr. Freedman for a period of five years beyond
the later of his retirement as an employee and his departure
from our Board of Directors. The deferred amounts due
Mr. Freedman under the long term incentive plan would be
put into a trust for the benefit of Mr. Freedman during the
deferral period.

On August 1, 2000, we entered into a trust
agreement with Wachovia Bank, N.A., for the benefit of
Mr. Freedman. The trust was created to carry out the
provisions of the retirement agreement and to hold assets
contributed by us sufficient to fund our obligation to
Mr. Freedman under the long term incentive plan. The Trust
constituted an unfunded arrangement, subject to the claims of
our creditors in the event of insolvency. We then deposited into
the Trust an amount equal to our remaining obligation to
Mr. Freedman under the long term incentive plan. On
August 25, 2000, a portion of this amount was used, at the
direction of Mr. Freedman, to purchase life insurance
policies, of which specified family members of Mr. Freedman
as the beneficiaries. Premiums on those life insurance policies
were payable over time, and payments began on August 25,
2000 and are scheduled to continue through August 25, 2004.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider
Participation

The Compensation Committee is composed of
Ms. Bronner and Messrs. Freedman and Mittler. There
are no “interlocks,” as defined by the SEC, with
respect to any member of the Compensation Committee.

Item 13.

Certain Relationships and Related
    Transactions

General

Some of our directors are directors, officers and
employees of Fortis and/or its subsidiaries. We have entered
into a shareholders’ agreement with Fortis Insurance N.V.
that gives Fortis the right to nominate designees to our board
of directors and the right to approve certain significant
corporate actions as described under
“— Shareholders’ Agreement.”

In the ordinary course of business, we have
entered into a number of agreements with Fortis and its
subsidiaries relating to our historical business and our
relationship with the Fortis group of companies, the material
terms of which are described below. In addition, we have entered
into agreements with Fortis relating to our separation from
Fortis and the ongoing relationship of our Company and Fortis,
as described below.

Registration Rights Agreement

We have entered into a registration rights
agreement with Fortis Insurance N.V. pursuant to which we have
granted to Fortis Insurance N.V. and its affiliates that become
our stockholders (collectively, Fortis Insurance) rights to
request registration under the Securities Act to effect a public
offering with respect to all or part of the shares of our common
stock owned by them from time to time during the term of the
agreement so long as the shares to be offered pursuant to the
request have an aggregate offering price of at least
$500 million (based on the then current market price) and,
when the aggregate registrable shares held by the stockholder is
less than or, after giving effect to the requested offering will
be, less than 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock,
$250 million. We will be required to fulfill such
obligation except in limited circumstances. The maximum number
of shares to be included in any such public offering will not
exceed the maximum number that the managing underwriter of such
public offering considers to be appropriate. These rights may be
exercised on an unlimited number of occasions with respect to
registration statements on Form S-2 or S-3 and on not more
than two occasions with respect to registration statements on
Form S-1; provided that we will not be obligated to effect
more than one registration in any 90-day period.

In addition, subject to limited exceptions, if we
propose to register any shares of our common stock, other equity
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
equity securities, whether or not for sale for our own account,
we are required to provide notice to Fortis Insurance, and if
requested by Fortis Insurance, we will include its shares in the
registration statement. The maximum number of shares to be
included in any such public offering will not exceed the maximum
number that the managing underwriter of such public offering
considers to be appropriate with priority given to securities
sought to be included at our request.

During the term of the agreement, Fortis
Insurance has agreed not to sell, transfer or hedge any shares
of our common stock or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for our common stock for 10 days prior to and
90 days after the effective date of a registration
statement for an underwritten public offering of any of our
equity securities (unless the underwriters of such offering
permit a shorter period).

We are generally obligated to pay all expenses of
the registration and offering of shares in connection with any
such registration, other than underwriting discounts and
commissions. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Fortis
Insurance for damages relating to a material misstatement or
omission in any registration statement or prospectus relating to
shares of our common stock to be sold by Fortis Insurance.
Fortis Insurance has agreed to indemnify us, our officers and
our directors on the same basis with respect to material
misstatements or omissions relating to information about Fortis
Insurance up to the amount of net proceeds received.

Generally, we may grant registration rights to
other persons; however, any such registration rights cannot be
exercised until after the second anniversary of this offering.



Shareholders’ Agreement

We have entered into a shareholders’
agreement with Fortis Insurance N.V. The shareholders’
agreement sets forth the following agreements as to corporate
governance matters:

Composition of Board of
Directors.

For so long as Fortis owns
at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, our board of
directors shall consist of no more than 12 directors
(including at least seven independent directors at such time as
is required by the listing standards of the New York Stock
Exchange). Fortis will have the right to nominate designees to
our board of directors and subject to limited exceptions, our
board of directors will nominate those designees as follows:
(i) so long as Fortis owns at least 10% of our outstanding
common stock, two designees (out of a maximum of
12 directors); and (ii) so long as Fortis owns less
than 10% but at least 5% of our outstanding common stock, one
designee. Currently, Fortis has two designees on our board of
directors, both of whom have been designated as Class III
directors. Fortis has agreed to cause the appropriate number of
Fortis designees to resign promptly at any time when the number
of Fortis designees on our board of directors exceeds the number
of designees to which Fortis is entitled, unless otherwise
requested by us. See “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Risk Factors —
Risks Related to Our Relationship with and Separation from
Fortis.”

Fortis Voting
Requirement.

As long as Fortis owns at
least 10% of our outstanding common stock, certain significant
corporate actions may only be taken with the approval of Fortis
Insurance N.V., as stockholder. See
“Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risk Factors — Risks Related to
Our Relationship with and Separation from Fortis” for more
detail on these provisions.

Cooperation Agreement

We have entered into a cooperation agreement with
Fortis Insurance N.V., Fortis N.V. and Fortis SA/NV relating to
our separation from Fortis and the ongoing relationship between
our Company and Fortis. Pursuant to this agreement, Fortis has
granted us non-exclusive, royalty-free rights to use the Fortis
name and marks for various transition periods ranging from one
to two years depending on the usage of such name or mark.

In addition, if Fortis is required to fully
consolidate our financial statements with Fortis’ financial
statements in accordance with International Accounting
Standards/ International Financial Reporting Standards 27
(including if for any reason Fortis owns 50% of our outstanding
common stock), we will be required to provide specified
information to Fortis, including financial information, risk
reporting, compliance reporting and drafts of earnings releases
and other public filings. We will also be required to provide
similar, but more limited, information to Fortis as long as
Fortis owns shares representing 20% or more of the voting power
of our outstanding common stock or during any period when Fortis
is required to account for its investment in our Company under
the equity method of accounting in accordance with International
Accounting Standards/ International Financial Reporting
Standards 28. In addition, we will be required to permit the
Fortis internal audit group to inspect our books and records and
to discuss affairs, finances and accounts with our officers and
auditors as long as Fortis owns shares representing 10% or more
of the voting power of our outstanding common stock.

The cooperation agreement also contains
provisions relating to, among other things:

•

cooperation between us and Fortis on various
    matters, including the timing of completion of audit reports and
    regulatory filings; and

•

existing vendor purchasing arrangements pursuant
    to which we purchase products and services also used by Fortis
    (which to the extent permitted by the underlying arrangement
    will continue for their term).

We are entitled to indemnification from Fortis
for losses arising out of any breach by Fortis of the
cooperation agreement. We are required to indemnify Fortis for
any losses arising out of any breach by us of the cooperation
agreement or any material untrue statement or omission contained
in any Fortis filing relating



to information about us provided by us to Fortis
for use in the filing and which is or would be required to be
included in any filing by us.

SERP Guarantee

Our SERP program provides that if the payments to
a participant or beneficiary will be made over a period of more
than one year and if at the time payments commence we are not
subject to pending proceedings as a debtor under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then Fortis Insurance N.V. will
guarantee the payment of SERP benefits to such participant or
beneficiary. The SERP further provides that if Fortis Insurance
N.V. ceases to be the beneficial owner of the Company, then such
guarantee will be limited to the actuarially equivalent value of
the participant’s SERP benefit immediately following such
cessation of beneficial ownership.

Guarantee of 1997 Capital Securities

In May 1997, Fortis Capital Trust, a trust
established by us, issued 150,000 8.40% capital securities (1997
Capital Securities I) to investors and 4,640 8.40% common
securities (the 1997 Common Securities I) to us, in each case
with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per security. Fortis
Capital Trust used the proceeds from the sale of the 1997
Capital Securities I and the 1997 Common Securities I
to purchase $154,640,000 of our 8.40% junior subordinated
debentures due 2027 (the 1997 Junior Subordinated Debentures I).
These debentures are the sole asset of Fortis Capital Trust.

In July 1997, Fortis Capital Trust II, a
trust established by us, issued 50,000 7.94% capital securities
(1997 Capital Securities II) to investors and 1,547 7.94%
common securities (1997 Common Securities II) to us, in
each case with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per security.
Fortis Capital Trust II used the proceeds from the sale of
the 1997 Capital Securities II and the 1997 Common
Securities II to purchase $51,547,000 of our 7.94% junior
subordinated debentures due 2027 (1997 Junior Subordinated
Debentures II). The 1997 Junior Subordinated
Debentures II are the sole asset of Fortis Capital
Trust II.

With respect to each of Fortis Capital Trust and
Fortis Capital Trust II, each us of, Fortis SA/ NV and
Fortis N.V. entered into a junior subordinated guarantee of the
distributions and payments on the liquidation and redemption of
the 1997 Capital Securities I and the 1997 Capital
Securities II, respectively, but only to the extent the
funds are held by Fortis Capital Trust and Fortis Capital
Trust II , respectively, Fortis SA/ NV and Fortis N.V. also
entered into a junior subordinated guarantee of the payment of
the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the 1997 Junior
Subordinated Debentures I and 1997 Junior Subordinates
Debentures II (together 1997 Junior Subordinated
Denbentures). The 1997 Junior Subordinated Debentures and the
guarantees are unsecured, junior subordinated obligations.

In January 2004, we redeemed all of the
outstanding 1997 Junior Subordinated Debentures, which resulted
in a mandatory redemption of all of the outstanding 1997 Capital
Securities I and 1997 Capital Securities II. The
issuer trusts under the 1997 Capital Securities I and 1997
Capital Securities II were dissolved in January 2004. We paid a
premium of approximately $66.7 million as a result of early
redemption.

The 1999 Trust Capital Securities and the
Company’s Subordinated Debentures

In April 1999, two of our subsidiary trusts, 1999
Fortis Capital Trust I and 1999 Fortis Capital
Trust II, issued 200,000 7.60% and 499,850 7.876% trust
capital securities (collectively, the 1999 Trust Capital
Securities), respectively, to Fortis Capital Funding LP and
Fortis Insurance N.V., respectively, in each case with a
liquidation amount of $1,000 per security. 1999 Fortis
Capital Trust I and 1999 Fortis Capital Trust II used
the proceeds from the sale of the applicable 1999 Trust Capital
Securities and trust common securities to purchase $200,001,000
and $499,851,000, respectively, of our 7.60% and
7.876% subordinated debentures due 2029 (collectively, the
1999 Subordinated Debentures), respectively. These debentures
were the sole assets of the trusts. The 1999 Trust Capital
Securities and the 1999 Subordinated Debentures were issued at
the time of the issuance by (i) Fortis Floating Rate
Capital Funding Trust of Euro 400 million floating rate
noncumulative guaranteed trust capital securities,
(ii) Fortis Fixed Rate Quarterly Capital Funding Trust of
Euro 200 million fixed rate quarterly noncumulative
guaranteed trust capital securities and (iii) Fortis Fixed
Rate



Annual Capital Funding Trust of Euro
50 million fixed rate annual noncumulative guaranteed trust
capital securities (collectively, the Fortis Trusts and the
Fortis Trust Securities), the common equity of each such Fortis
Trust being owned indirectly by Fortis. The payments we made on
the 1999 Subordinated Debentures and accordingly the payments
made on the 1999 Trust Capital Securities were ultimately used
by Fortis Insurance N.V. and Fortis Capital Funding LP to make
payments on the Fortis Trust Securities. The payments we made on
the 1999 Subordinated Debentures and therefore on the 1999 Trust
Capital Securities exceeded the total payments due by the Fortis
Trusts on the Fortis Trust Securities. In addition, in
connection with the Fortis Trust Securities, we entered into a
services agreement pursuant to which we were obligated to
provide legal, accounting, tax and other general support
services, including providing necessary administrative and
record-keeping services for Fortis Capital Funding LP and the
Fortis Trusts for an annual fee of $100,000. In December 2003,
we redeemed all of the 1999 Subordinated Debentures at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
(i) accrued interest to the date of redemption and
(ii) premium of approximately $64 million, which in
turn caused the redemption of all of the 1999 Trust Capital
Securities.

2000 Trust Capital Securities and Subordinated
Debentures

In March 2000, two of our subsidiary trusts,
Fortis Capital Proceeds Trust 2000-1 and Fortis Capital Proceeds
Trust 2000-2, issued 150,000 8.48% and 400,000 8.40% trust
capital securities (collectively, the 2000 Trust Capital
Securities), respectively, to Fortis Insurance N.V., in each
case with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per security.
Fortis Capital Proceeds Trust 2000-1 and Fortis Capital Proceeds
Trust 2000-2 used the proceeds from the sale of the applicable
2000 Trust Capital Securities and trust common securities to
purchase $150,001,000 and $400,001,000, respectively, of our
8.48% and 8.40% subordinated debentures due 2030
(collectively, the 2000 Subordinated Debentures), respectively.
These debentures were the sole assets of the trusts. In December
2003, we redeemed all of the 2000 Subordinated Debentures at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
(i) accrued interest to the date of redemption and
(ii) premium of approximately $73 million, which in
turn caused the redemption of all of the 2000 Trust Capital
Securities.

Commercial Paper Program and Other
Indebtedness

Historically, Fortis has maintained a
$1 billion commercial paper facility that we have been able
to access (via intercompany loans) for up to $750 million.
We have used the commercial paper facility to cover any cash
shortfalls, which may occur from time to time. During 2003 we
accessed $75 million of this facility for three days in
connection with the extinguishment of the mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts. We had no commercial
paper borrowings with Fortis associated with this commercial
paper facility during the year ended December 31, 2002. In
2001, $217 million in commercial paper was issued and
redeemed by Fortis on our behalf. We had no outstanding
intercompany loans with Fortis related to this commercial paper
facility at year end December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In
connection with our separation from Fortis, we no longer have
access to this facility.

In addition, we previously had indebtedness
outstanding in the amount of $225 million to Fortis Finance
N.V., which was repaid in April 2001. See
“Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Reimbursement of Fortis Liaison
Office

During 2003, 2002, and 2001, we paid $644,000,
$749,000 and $516,000, respectively, to Fortis for costs
representing salary, benefits and other expenses of Arie
Fakkert, who was then an employee of one of Fortis’
subsidiaries, and his support staff. Mr. Fakkert, who
served on our board from 1987 to 2004, retired from Fortis as of
October 3, 2003, and we discontinued these payments as of
that date.

Guarantee of Senior Bridge Credit
Facilities

Fortis has guaranteed our obligations under the
$1,100 million unsecured senior bridge credit facility with
a group of banks arranged by Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley &
Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Banc One
Capital Market, Inc.



Fortis has also guaranteed our obligations under
a $650 million senior bridge credit facility with a group
of banks arranged by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.,
an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co, Incorporated,
including Merrill Lynch Capital Corp., an affiliate of Merrill,
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and Credit
Suisse First Boston (acting through its Cayman Islands branch),
an affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston LLC. Borrowings under
the senior bridge credit facilities were repaid in February 2004
with the proceeds of the capital contribution described under
“— Fortis Capital Contribution(s)” and the
proceeds of our $975 million bond offering.

Fortis Capital Contribution

We received a $725.5 million capital
contribution from Fortis on February 5, 2004 and used the
proceeds of that capital contribution to repay the
$650 million of outstanding indebtedness under the
$650 million senior bridge credit facility and
$75.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under the
$1,100 million senior bridge credit facility. In exchange
for this capital contribution, 32,976,854 shares of our
common stock were issued to Fortis Insurance N.V. simultaneously
with the closing of our initial public offering on
February 5, 2004. See “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

Indemnification

Pursuant to an underwriting agreement entered
into in connection with our recent offering, we and Fortis
Insurance N.V. have agreed to indemnify each other against
certain liabilities.

    performing work for the Company that such firm shall report
    directly to the Committee

    have been pre-approved.

“Prohibited non-auditing services” are
services that Congress, the SEC or the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board prohibits through regulation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, pre-approval is not necessary for minor audit
services if: (i) the aggregate amount of all such non-audit
services provided to the Company constitutes not more than 5% of
the total amount of revenues paid by the Company to its auditor
during the fiscal year in which the non-audit services are
provided; (ii) such services were not recognized by the
Company at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services;
and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the
attention of the Audit Committee and approved prior to the
completion of the audit by the Audit Committee or by one or more
members of the Audit Committee who are members of the Board to
whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more
of its members the authority to approve in advance all
significant audit or non-audit services to be provided by the
independent auditors so long as it is presented to the full
Audit Committee at a later time.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Assurant, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the index appearing under
item 15 (a)(1) of this Form 10-K, present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Assurant,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (formerly Fortis, Inc. and
subsidiaries) at December 31, 2003, and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion the
financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing
under item 15 (a)(2) of this Form 10-K present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and the
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 142,

1.     Nature of
Operations

Assurant, Inc. (formerly Fortis, Inc.) (the
“Company”) is a holding company provider of
specialized insurance products and related services in North
America and selected other markets. At December 31, 2003,
Fortis, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada and was indirectly
wholly owned by Fortis N.V. of the Netherlands and Fortis
SA/ NV of Belgium (collectively, “Fortis”) through
their affiliates, including their wholly owned subsidiary,
Fortis Insurance N.V. (see Note 12).

On February 5, 2004, Fortis sold
approximately 65% of its ownership interest in Assurant, Inc.
via an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). In connection
with the IPO, Fortis, Inc. was merged into Assurant, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, which was formed solely for the purpose of
the redomestication of Fortis, Inc. After the merger, Assurant,
Inc. became the successor to the business, operations and
obligations of Fortis, Inc. Assurant, Inc. is traded on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol AIZ.

The following events occurred in connection with
the merger: each share of the existing Class A Common Stock
of Fortis, Inc. was exchanged for 10.75882039 shares of Common
Stock of Assurant, Inc.; the automatic conversion of the shares
of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock into
an aggregate of 25,841,418 shares of Common Stock of Assurant,
Inc.; each share of the existing Series B Preferred Stock
of Fortis, Inc. was exchanged for one share of Series B
Preferred Stock of Assurant, Inc.; each share of the existing
Series C Preferred Stock of Fortis, Inc. was exchanged for
one share of Series C Preferred Stock of Assurant, Inc.

The following events occurred in connection with
the Company’s IPO: (1) redeemed the outstanding
$196,224 of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts in January 2004 (see Note 8),
(2) issued 68,976 shares of Common Stock of Assurant, Inc.
to certain officers of the Company, and (3) issued
32,976,854 shares of Common Stock of Assurant, Inc. to Fortis
Insurance N.V. simultaneously with the closing of the IPO in
exchange for a $725,500 capital contribution based on the public
offering price of the Company’s common stock. The Company
used the proceeds of the capital contribution to repay the
$650,000 of outstanding indebtedness under the $650,000 senior
bridge credit facility (see Note 9) and $75,500 of
outstanding indebtedness under the $1,100,000 senior bridge
credit facility. The Company repaid a portion of the $1,100,000
senior bridge credit facility with $49,500 in cash. On
February 18, 2004, the Company refinanced $975,000 of the
remaining $1,100,000 senior bridge credit facility with the
proceeds of the issuance of two senior long-term notes.

Through its operating subsidiaries, the Company
provides creditor-placed homeowners insurance, manufactured
housing homeowners insurance, debt protection administration,
credit insurance, warranties and extended service contracts,
individual health and small employer group health insurance,
group dental insurance, group disability insurance, group life
insurance and prefunded funeral insurance. The Company had
certain individual life insurance policies, investment-type
annuity contracts and mutual fund operations during 2001, which
were sold to the Hartford Financial Services Group (“The
Hartford”) (see note 4).

2.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates when
recording transactions resulting from business operations based
on information currently available. The most significant items
on the Company’s balance sheet that involve accounting
estimates and actuarial determinations are the value of business
acquired (“VOBA”), goodwill, reinsurance recoverables,
valuation of investments, deferred acquisi-

F-8


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

tion costs (“DAC”), liabilities for
future policy benefits and expenses, taxes and claims and
benefits payable. The accounting estimates and actuarial
determinations are sensitive to market conditions, investment
yields, mortality, morbidity, commissions and other acquisition
expenses, and terminations by policyholders. As additional
information becomes available or actual amounts are
determinable, the recorded estimates will be revised and
reflected in operating results. Although some variability is
inherent in these estimates, the Company believes the amounts
provided are reasonable and adequate.

Dollar amounts are presented in U.S. dollars and
all amounts are in thousands except for number of shares and
securities and per share amounts, and per security amounts.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and
balances are eliminated in consolidation. See notes 3 and 4
for acquisitions and dispositions of businesses.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income is comprised of net income
and other comprehensive income, which includes foreign currency
translation, unrealized gains and losses on securities
classified as available for sale, less deferred income taxes and
direct charges for additional minimum pension liability.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2002 and 2001 financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2003
presentation.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

The Company considers cash on hand, all operating
cash and working capital cash to be cash equivalents. These
amounts are carried principally at cost, which approximates fair
value. Cash balances are reviewed at the end of each reporting
period to determine if negative cash balances exist. If negative
cash balances do exist, the cash accounts are netted with other
positive cash accounts of the same bank providing the right of
offset exists between the accounts. If the right of offset does
not exist, the negative cash balances are reclassified to
accounts payable.

Investments

The Company’s investment strategy is
developed based on many factors including appropriate insurance
asset and liability management, rate of return, maturity, credit
risk, tax considerations and regulatory requirements.

Fixed maturities and equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. If
the fair value is higher than the amortized cost for debt
securities or the purchase cost for equity securities, the
excess is an unrealized gain; and if lower than cost, the
difference is an unrealized loss. The net unrealized gains and
losses, less deferred income taxes are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income.

Commercial mortgage loans on real estate are
reported at unpaid balances, adjusted for amortization of
premium or discount, less allowance for losses. Allowances, if
necessary, are established for mortgage loans based on the
difference between the unpaid loan balance and the estimated
fair value of the underlying real estate when such loans are
determined to be in default as to scheduled payments. The change
in the allowance for losses is recorded as realized gains and
losses on investments. Such allowances are based on the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan’s effective interest rate or at the loan’s
observable market price, or the fair market value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

F-9


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Policy loans are reported at unpaid principal
balances, which do not exceed the cash surrender value of the
underlying policies.

Short-term investments include all investment
cash and highly liquid investments. These amounts are carried
principally at cost, which approximates fair value.

Other investments consist of investments in joint
ventures, partnerships, and invested assets associated with a
modified coinsurance arrangement. The joint ventures and
partnerships are valued according to the equity method of
accounting. The invested assets related to the modified
coinsurance arrangements are classified as trading securities
and are reported at fair value. Any changes in the fair value
are recorded as net realized gains and losses in the statement
of operations.

The Company regularly monitors its investment
portfolio to determine that investments that may be other than
temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and
properly valued, and that any impairments are charged against
earnings in the proper period. The Company’s methodology to
identify potential impairments requires professional judgment.
Changes in individual security values are monitored on a
semi-monthly basis in order to identify potential credit
problems. In addition, securities whose market price is equal to
85% or less of their original purchase price are added to the
impairment watchlist, which is discussed at monthly meetings
attended by members of the Company’s investment, accounting
and finance departments. Any security whose price decrease is
deemed other-than-temporary is written down to its then current
market level. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties
involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and
critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more
pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect
one or more companies, industry sectors or countries could
result in additional write downs in future periods for
impairments that are deemed to be other-than-temporary.

Realized gains and losses on sales of investments
and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are
recognized on the specific identification basis.

Investment income is recorded as earned net of
investment expenses.

The Company anticipates prepayments of principal
in the calculation of the effective yield for mortgage-backed
securities and structured securities. The majority of the
Company’s mortgage-backed securities and structured
securities are of high credit quality. Therefore, the
retrospective method is used to adjust the effective yield.

Reinsurance

Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related
to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy
and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and
policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is
accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured
policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account
for the policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are
estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment
expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are
reported in the consolidated balance sheets. The cost of
reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is accounted for
over the life of the underlying reinsured policies. The ceding
of insurance does not discharge the Company’s primary
liability to insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful
accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of
balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency,
management’s experience, and current economic conditions.

Deferred
Acquisition Costs

The costs of acquiring new business that vary
with and are primarily related to the production of new business
are deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed
recoverable from future premiums or gross

F-10


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist of
commissions, policy issuance expenses, premium taxes and certain
direct marketing expenses.

A premium deficiency is recognized by a charge to
the statement of operations as a reduction of DAC to the extent
that future policy premiums, including anticipation of interest
income, are not adequate to recover all DAC and related claims,
benefits and expenses. If the premium deficiency is greater than
unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess
deficiency.

Short
Duration Contracts

DAC relating to property contracts, warranty and
extended service contracts and single premium credit insurance
contracts is amortized over the term of the contracts in
relation to premiums earned.

Acquisition costs on individual medical issued in
most jurisdictions after 2002, small group medical, group term
life, and group disability, consist primarily of commissions to
agents and brokers, which are level, and compensation to
representatives, which is spread out and is not front-end
loaded. These costs do not vary with the production of new
business. As a result, these costs are not deferred, but rather
they are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in
the period in which they are incurred.

Long
Duration Contracts

Acquisition costs for pre-funded funeral life
insurance policies and life insurance policies no longer offered
are deferred and amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums
over the premium-paying period.

For pre-funded funeral investment type annuities
and universal life and investment-type annuities no longer
offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of
estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality,
expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of
the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates
are consistent with those used in computing the policy or
contract liabilities.

Acquisition costs relating to individual medical
contracts issued prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number
of jurisdictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated
average terms of the underlying contracts. These acquisitions
costs relate to commissions and policy issuance expenses.
Commissions represents the majority of deferred costs and result
from commission schedules that pay significantly higher rates in
the first year. The majority of deferred policy issuance
expenses are the costs of separately underwriting each
individual medical contract.

Acquisition costs on the FFG and Long-Term Care
(“LTC”) disposed businesses were written off when the
businesses were sold.

Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment are reported at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives with a maximum
of 39.5 years for buildings, 7 years for furniture and
5 years for equipment. Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to income as incurred. Expenditures for
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining
useful life of the asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition
costs over the net fair values of identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
(“FAS 142”),

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,

as of January 1, 2002. Pursuant to
FAS 142, goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and
should not be amortized, but rather tested at least

annually for impairment. The goodwill impairment
test has two steps. The first identifies potential impairments
by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book
value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting
unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and
the second step is not required. If the carrying value exceeds
the fair value, the second step calculates the possible
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill
with the carrying amount. If the implied goodwill is less than
the carrying amount, a write down is recorded. Prior to the
adoption of FAS 142, goodwill was amortized over
20 years. Upon the adoption of FAS 142, the Company
ceased amortizing goodwill, and recognized a $1,260,939
impairment charge as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. The measurement of fair value was
determined based on a valuation report prepared by an
independent valuation firm. The valuation was based on an
evaluation of ranges of future discounted earnings, public
company trading multiples and acquisitions of similar companies.
Certain key assumptions considered include forecasted trends in
revenues, operating expenses and effective tax rates. The
Company performs a goodwill impairment test during the second
quarter of each year.

Value of
Business Acquired

VOBA is the identifiable intangible asset
representing the value of the insurance business acquired. The
amount is determined using best estimates for mortality, lapse,
maintenance expenses and investment returns at date of purchase.
The amount determined represents the purchase price paid to the
seller for producing the business. Similar to the amortization
of DAC, the amortization of VOBA is over the premium payment
period for traditional life insurance policies and a small block
of limited payment policies. For the remaining limited payment
policies, all universal life policies and annuities, the
amortization of VOBA is over the expected life time of the
policies.

VOBA is tested for recoverability annually. If it
is determined that future policy premiums and investment income
or gross profits are not adequate to cover related losses or
loss expenses, then VOBA is charged to current earnings.

Separate
Accounts

Assets and liabilities associated with separate
accounts relate to premium and annuity considerations for
variable life and annuity products for which the
contract-holder, rather than the Company, bears the investment
risk. Separate account assets are reported at fair value.
Revenues and expenses related to the separate account assets and
liabilities, to the extent of benefits paid or provided to the
separate account policyholders, are excluded from the amounts
reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. Through April 1, 2001, the Company received
administrative fees for managing the funds and other fees for
assuming mortality and certain expense risks. Such fees were
included in net earned premiums and other considerations in the
consolidated statements of operations. Since April 1, 2001,
all fees have been ceded to The Hartford (see note 4).

Income
Taxes

Current federal income taxes are charged to
operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or
recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current
year. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary
differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax
basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and
statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect
the temporary differences to reverse.

Other
Assets

Other assets include prepaid items and intangible
assets. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives,
including costs capitalized relating to developing software for
internal use, are amortized on a straight-line

F-12


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

basis over their estimated useful lives. The
Company tests the intangible assets for impairment whenever
circumstances warrant, but at least annually. If impairment
exists, then excess of the unamortized balance over the fair
value of the intangible assets will be charged to earnings at
that time. Other assets also include the Company’s
approximately 25% interest in Private Health Care Systems, Inc.
(“PHCS”). The Company was a co-founder of PHCS, a
provider network. The Company accounts for PHCS according to the
equity method.

Foreign
Currency Translation

For those foreign affiliates where the foreign
currency is the functional currency, unrealized foreign exchange
gains (losses) net of income taxes have been reflected in
Stockholders’ Equity under the caption “Accumulated
other comprehensive income.”

Premiums

Short
Duration Contracts

The Company’s short duration contracts are
those on which the Company recognizes revenue on a pro-rata
basis over the contract term. The Company’s short duration
contracts primarily include individual medical issued after 2002
in most jurisdictions, small group medical, group term life,
group disability, dental, property, credit insurance, warranties
and extended service contracts.

Long
Duration Contracts

Currently, the Company’s long duration
contracts being sold are individual medical contracts issued in
the State of Minnesota, pre-funded funeral life insurance and
investment type annuities. For pre-funded funeral life insurance
policies, any excess of the gross premium over the net premium
is deferred and is recognized in income in a constant
relationship with the insurance in force. For pre-funded funeral
investment-type annuity contracts, revenues consist of charges
assessed against policy balances.

For individual medical contracts sold prior to
2003, and currently in a limited number of jurisdictions and
traditional life insurance contracts sold by the PreNeed segment
that are no longer offered, revenue is recognized when due from
policyholders.

For universal life insurance and investment-type
annuity contracts sold by the Solutions segment that are no
longer offered, revenues consist of charges assessed against
policy balances.

Premiums for LTC insurance and traditional life
insurance contracts within FFG are recognized as revenue when
due from the policyholder. For universal life insurance and
investment-type annuity contracts within FFG, revenues consist
of charges assessed against policy balances. For the FFG and LTC
businesses previously sold, all revenue is ceded to the Hartford
and John Hancock, respectively.

Reinsurance
Assumed

Reinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based
upon payments received from ceding companies together with
accrual estimates, which are based on both payments received and
in force policy information received from ceding companies. Any
subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in
the period in which they are determined.

Fee
Income

The Company primarily derives income from fees
received from providing administrative services. Fee income is
earned when services are performed.

F-13


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Administrator obligor service contracts are sales
in which the Company is designated as the obligor. For these
contract sales, the Company recognizes revenues in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin
90-1 (“TB 90-1”),

Accounting for Separately Priced
Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts,

and
FAS No. 60,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
Enterprises.

Administration fees related to these contracts
are generally recognized as earned on the same basis as the
premium is recognized or on a straight-line pro-rata basis.
Administration fees related to the unexpired portion of the
contract term are deferred. Acquisition costs related to these
contracts are also deferred. Both the deferred administration
fees and acquisition costs are amortized over the term of the
contracts. Deferred administration fees at December 31,
2003 and 2002 were $29,076 and 28,845, respectively.
Amortization income recognized in fees and other income for 2003
and 2002 were $23,183 and $26,463, respectively.

Reserves

Reserves are established according to generally
accepted actuarial principles and are based on a number of
factors. These factors include experience derived from
historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at
loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors
include trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to
which all claims have been reported, and internal claims
processing charges. The process used in computing reserves
cannot be exact, particularly for liability coverages, since
actual claim costs are dependent upon such complex factors as
inflation, changes in doctrines of legal liabilities and damage
awards. The methods of making such estimates and establishing
the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated.

Short
Duration Contracts

For short duration contracts, claims and benefits
payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The
liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the
claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include
(1) case basis reserves for known but unpaid claims as of
the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported
(“IBNR”) reserves for claims where the insured event
has occurred but has not been reported to the Company as of the
balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense
reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims.

For group disability, the case base reserves and
the IBNR are calculated based on historical experience and on
assumptions relating to claim severity, frequency, and other
factors. These assumptions are modified as necessary to reflect
anticipated trends, with any adjustment being reflected in
current operations. We establish reserves for disability
policies in an amount equal to the net present value of the
expected claims future payments. Group long-term disability
reserves are discounted to the valuation date at the valuation
interest rate. The valuation interest rate is determined by
taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on
our asset portfolio, with adjustments for investment expenses
and provisions for adverse deviation.

The Company has exposure to asbestos,
environmental and other general liability claims arising from
its participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through
1983. The Company carried case reserves for these liabilities as
recommended by the various pool managers and bulk reserves for
claims incurred but not yet reported of $37,000 (before
reinsurance) and $36,000 (after reinsurance) in the aggregate at
December 31, 2003. Any estimation of these liabilities is
subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to
the general lack of sufficient detailed data, reporting delays,
and absence of generally accepted actuarial methodology for the
exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal
issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what
constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of
ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to
financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

Unearned premium reserves are maintained for the
portion of the premiums on short duration contracts that is
related to the unexpired period of the policy.

ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Long
Duration Contracts

Future policy benefits and expense reserves on
LTC, life insurance policies that are no longer offered,
individual medical policies issued prior to 2003 or issued in
the State of Minnesota and the traditional life insurance
contracts within FFG are recorded at the present value of future
benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less
the present value of the future net premiums. These amounts are
estimated and include assumptions as to the expected investment
yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates as
well as other assumptions that are based on the Company’s
experience. These assumptions reflect anticipated trends and
include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.

Future policy benefits and expense reserves for
pre-funded funeral investment-type annuities, universal life
insurance policies and investment-type annuity contracts no
longer offered, and the variable life insurance and
investment-type annuity contracts in FFG consist of policy
account balances before applicable surrender charges and certain
deferred policy initiation fees that are being recognized in
income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged
to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of
policy account balances and interest credited to policy account
balances.

Future policy benefits and expense reserves for
pre-funded funeral life insurance contracts are recorded as the
present value of future benefits to policyholders and related
expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve
assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected
investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates.
These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company
experience and include provision for possible unfavorable
deviation. An unearned premium reserve is also recorded for
these contracts which represents the balance of the excess of
gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized
in future years’ income in a constant relationship to
insurance in force.

Changes in the estimated liabilities are charged
or credited to operations as the estimates are revised.

Stock Based
Compensation

In contemplation of the IPO, the Company’s
Stock Option Plan was terminated effective September 22,
2003, and all stock options thereunder were cancelled in
exchange for a payment of the fair value of such options, as
determined by an independent third party. Payments totaling
$2,237 were made in the fourth quarter of 2003. There is no
further obligation associated with the Company’s Stock
Option Plan.

The Company accounted for the stock option plan
as prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,

(“APB 25”) and related
interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost was charged to
income over the service period (vesting period) and was adjusted
for subsequent changes in the market value of the stock that
were subsequently amortized over the vesting period.

The following table illustrates the effect of
applying the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, on net income and
earnings per share. Pro forma information of

net income (loss) and net income
(loss) per share assuming the Company had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of FAS 123, is a follows:

(A) Represents reversal of expense accrual
due to reduction of intrinsic value.

The fair value of each option granted was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes multiple
option approach with the following assumptions for options
granted in 2002 and 2001:

Business
Combinations

Effective July 1, 2001, the Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standard 141,

Business Combinations

(“FAS 141”). FAS 141 requires that all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and
establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible
assets separately from goodwill. The Company followed this
statement for the acquisitions of the Dental Benefits Division
(“DBD”) of Protective Life Corporation
(“Protective”) and CORE, Inc. (“CORE”) (see
note 3). For the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, the Company recognized $3,898 and $4,010, respectively, of
amortization expense related to other identifiable intangible
assets, which are included in underwriting, general and
administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued FAS 146,

Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

(“FAS 146”). This statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task
Force (“EITF”) Issue 94-3, Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit on
Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in Restructuring
(“EITF 94-3”)). EITF 94-3 required accrual
of liabilities related to exit and disposal activities at a plan
(commitment) date. FAS 146 requires that a liability
for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred. The provisions of
this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities
that are initiated after December 31,

F-16


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2002. The Company adopted this Statement on
January 1, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial position or
the results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees

(“FIN 45”). FIN 45
requires that a liability be recognized at the inception of
certain guarantees for the fair value of the obligation,
including the ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over
the term of the guarantee. Guarantees, as defined in
FIN 45, include contracts that contingently require the
Company to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes
in an underlying obligation that is related to an asset,
liability or equity security of the guaranteed party,
performance guarantees, indemnification agreements and indirect
guarantees of indebtedness of others. This new accounting
standard is effective for certain guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002. In addition, FIN 45 requires
certain additional disclosures. The Company adopted this
standard on January 1, 2003, and the adoption did not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial position or
the results of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure — an Amendment of
FAS No. 123

(“FAS 148”).
FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value-based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. FAS 148 also amends
the disclosure requirements of FAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, to require prominent disclosures in
both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect
of the method used on reported results. This guidance is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002,
for transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions and is
effective for interim reports beginning after December 15,
2002, for interim disclosure provisions. The Company accounts
for stock-based employee compensation as prescribed by APB
No. 25 and its interpretations. Therefore, the transition
requirements of FAS 148 do not apply. However, the Company
adopted the disclosure requirements of this standard for the
year ended December 31, 2002.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
46 (“FIN 46”),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51

(“ARB 51”), which clarifies the
consolidation accounting guidance in ARB 51, Consolidated
Financial Statements, as it applies to certain entities in which
equity investors who do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity
at risk for the entities to finance their activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
Such entities are known as variable interest entities
(“VIEs”). FIN 46 requires that the primary
beneficiary of a VIE consolidate the VIE. FIN 46 also
requires new disclosures for significant relationships with
VIEs, whether or not consolidation accounting is either used or
anticipated. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply
immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. They
apply in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a
variable interest that was acquired before February 1,
2003. On October 8, 2003, the FASB deferred the adoption of
FIN 46 until reporting periods ending after
December 15, 2003. The Company adopted this Interpretation
on December 31, 2003, and the adoption did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB’s Derivative
Implementation Group (“DIG”) released FAS 133
Implementation Issue B36, Embedded Derivatives: Modified
Coinsurance Arrangement and Debt Instrument that Incorporates
Credit Risk Exposures that are Unrelated or Only Partially
Related to the Creditworthiness of the obligor under those
Instruments (“DIG B36”). DIG B36 addresses
whether FAS 133 requires bifurcation of a debt instrument
into a debt host contract and an embedded derivative if the debt
instrument incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk
exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the
creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument. Under
DIG B36, modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds
withheld reinsurance agreements as well as other types of
receivables and payables where interest is determined by
reference to a pool of fixed maturity assets or a total return
debt index are examples of arrangements containing embedded
derivatives requiring bifurcation. The Company adopted
DIG B36 on October 1, 2003 and determined that the
modified coinsurance agreement with The Hartford contained an

F-17


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

embedded derivative. In accordance with
DIG B36, the Company bifurcated the contract into its debt
host and embedded derivative (total return swap) and recorded
the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance sheet with
changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of
operations. The Company recorded a $22,716 increase in accounts
payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet
and a $22,716 net realized loss on investments in the
consolidated statements of operations. Contemporaneous with the
adoption of DIG B36, the Company transferred the invested
assets related to this coinsurance agreement from fixed
maturities available for sale to trading securities, included in
other investments in the December 31, 2003 consolidated
balance sheet. The mark-to-market adjustment of the trading
securities resulted in a net realized gain of $22,716, which was
recorded to the consolidated statement of operations as realized
gains on investments. The combination of the two aforementioned
transactions had no net impact in the consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2003.

In April 2003, the FASB issued FAS 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

(“FAS 149”). This
statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively
referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FAS
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This Statement is effective prospectively for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and
prospectively for hedging relationships designated after
June 30, 2003. The Company has assessed that the adoption
of this standard will not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position or the results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued FAS 150,

Accounting For Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

(“FAS 150”). This statement improves the
accounting for certain financial instruments that, under
previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity, and
requires that these instruments be classified as liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheets. This statement is effective
prospectively for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. This statement shall be implemented by
reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting
principle for financial instruments created before the issuance
date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the
interim period of adoption. The Company has adopted this
standard and has reclassified mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts and mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock from mezzanine to liabilities.

On July 7, 2003, the Accounting Standards
Executive Committee (“AcSEC”) of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”)
issued Statement of Position 03-1,

Accounting and Reporting
by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long
Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts

(“SOP 03-1”). SOP 03-1 provides guidance
on a number of topics unique to insurance enterprises, including
separate account presentation, interest in separate accounts,
gains and losses on the transfer of assets from the general
account to a separate account, liability valuation, returns
based on a contractually referenced pool of assets or index,
accounting for contracts that contain death or other insurance
benefit features, accounting for reinsurance and other similar
contracts, accounting for annuitization benefits and sales
inducements to contract holders. SOP 03-1 will be effective
for the Company’s financial statements on January 1,
2004. The Company assessed this statement and determined that
the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact
on the Company’s financial position or the results of
operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued FAS 132
(Revised 2003),

Employers’ Disclosure about Pensions and
Other Postretirement Benefits

(“FAS 132” — Revised 2003). This
statement revises employers’ disclosure about pension plans
and other postretirement benefit plans. This statement does not
change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by
FAS No. 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,
No. 88, Employers’ Accounting for Settlement and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
Termination Benefits, and No. 106, Employers’
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. This
statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in
FAS 132, Employers’ Disclosure about Pensions and
Other Postretirement Benefits, which it replaces. It requires
additional disclosure to that found

F-18


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in FAS 132 about the assets, obligations,
cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit
pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans and
will be effective for fiscal year ending after December 15,
2003. The Company fully adopted this statement. See Note 17.

3.     Acquisitions

The following transactions have been accounted
for under the purchase method. Consequently, the purchase price
has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on the relative fair values. The results of operations of
the businesses acquired have been included in the consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition.

Dental
Benefits Division (“DBD”) of Protective Life
Corporation (“Protective”)

On December 31, 2001, the Company acquired
DBD, including the acquisition through reinsurance of
Protective’s indemnity dental, life, and disability
businesses and purchase of the stock of its prepaid dental
subsidiaries.

Protective’s Dental Benefits Division at the
time of acquisition was a leading provider of voluntary
(employee-paid) indemnity dental and prepaid dental coverage for
employee groups. As a result of the acquisition, the Company
expects to be a leading provider of dental insurance products in
the voluntary (employee-paid) market. It also expects to reduce
costs through economies of scale.

The following table summarizes the purchase price
and net cash paid for the transaction:

Of the $54,300 of other intangible assets, $5,600
was assigned to licenses that are not subject to amortization.
The remaining $48,700 consists of the current groups in force
and a dental provider network, which are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which
range from 20 to 30 years.

The following table reflects the Company’s
results of operations on an unaudited pro forma basis as if the
acquisition of DBD had been completed on January 1, 2001.
The pro forma results include estimates and assumptions which
management believes are reasonable. However, pro forma results
do not include the effects of synergies and cost reduction
initiatives directly related to the acquisitions. The pro forma
financial information is not necessarily indicative of the
operating results that would have occurred had the acquisitions
been consummated as of the dates indicated, nor are they
necessarily indicative of future operating results.

Core, Inc. (“CORE”)

On July 12, 2001, the Company acquired 100%
of the outstanding common shares of CORE for approximately
$57,000 in cash. CORE at the time of acquisition was a leading
national provider of employee absence management services and a
major provider of disability reinsurance management services to
middle-market insurance carriers. As a result of the
acquisition, the Employee Benefits segment derives expertise in
disability services and solutions, including clinical disability
management and Family and Medical Leave Act administration. The
segment also expects to realize improvements in pricing accuracy
and duration care management through direct access to
CORE’s data.

4.     Dispositions

Neighborhood
Health Partnership (“NHP”)

On June 28, 2002, the Company sold its 50%
ownership in NHP to NHP Holding LLC for $12,000. NHP is a
Florida Health Maintenance Organization. The Company recorded a
pretax gain on sale of $10,672.

Fortis
Financial Group (“FFG”)

On April 2, 2001, the Company sold its FFG
business to The Hartford for $1,086,752, net of expenses. FFG
included certain individual life insurance policies,
investment-type annuity contracts and mutual fund operations.
The transaction was structured as a stock sale for the mutual
fund management operations and as a reinsurance arrangement for
the insurance operations (see note 14).

The sale resulted in a total pre-tax gain of
$623,071 of which $61,688 was for the mutual fund operations and
$3,854 was for property and equipment. The total pre-tax gain
was derived by deducting the value of assets and liabilities
sold or ceded from the net proceeds. The net proceeds
attributable to the mutual fund operations and reinsurance
arrangement were determined based on relative values of the
business sold. Such valuations were based on analyses from
external consultants.

Of the total pre-tax gain, $557,529 related to
the reinsurance contracts and was deferred. The reinsurance
contracts did not legally replace the Company as the insurer to
policyholders or extinguish the Company’s liabilities to
its policyholders. The reserves for this block of business are
included in the Company’s reserves (see note 15). The
deferred gain is being amortized over the remaining life of the
underlying business. The amortization of the deferred gain is
more rapid in the first few years after sale and will be slower
as the liabilities in the reinsured block decrease. During 2003,
2002 and 2001, the Company recognized pre-tax income of
approximately $65,594, $73,024, and $59,647, respectively,
reflecting the amortization of a portion of the deferred gain in
the results of operations.

The Company recorded $20,271, $85,295, and
$78,232 of pre-tax realized losses in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, associated with other-than-temporary declines in
value of available for sale securities.

The investment category and duration of the
Company’s gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and
equity securities at December 31, 2003 were as follows:

The unrealized loss position at December 31,
2003 consisted of approximately $13,300 in unrealized losses on
fixed maturity securities and approximately $700 in unrealized
losses on equity securities. The total unrealized loss
represents less than 2% of the aggregate fair value of the
related securities. Approximately 99% of these unrealized losses
have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve
months. The total unrealized losses are comprised of 284
individual securities with 14% of the individual securities
having an

F-23


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

unrealized loss of more than $100. The total
unrealized losses on securities that were in a continuous
unrealized loss position for longer than six months but less
than 12 months was approximately $7,600, with no security
having a market value below 92% of book value.

As part of the Company’s ongoing monitoring
process, the Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio
to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily
impaired are identified on a timely basis and that any
impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. The
Company has reviewed these securities and concluded that there
were no additional other than temporary impairments as of
December 31, 2003. Due to issuers’ continued
satisfaction of the securities’ obligations in accordance
with their contractual terms and their continued expectations to
do so, as well as the Company’s evaluation of the
fundamentals of the issuers’ financial condition;
therefore, the Company believes that the securities in an
unrealized loss status are not impaired and intends to hold them
until recovery.

The Company has made commercial mortgage loans,
collateralized by the underlying real estate, on properties
located throughout the United States. At December 31, 2003,
approximately 34% of the outstanding principal balance of
commercial mortgage loans were concentrated in the states of
California, New York, and Pennsylvania. Although the Company has
a diversified loan portfolio, an economic downturn could have an
adverse impact on the ability of its debtors to repay their
loans. The outstanding balance of commercial mortgage loans
range in size from $22 to $9,350 at December 31, 2003. The
mortgage loan balance is net of an allowance for losses of
$18,854 and $19,106 at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

At December 31, 2003, loan commitments
outstanding totaled approximately $75,900. Furthermore, at
December 31, 2003, the Company is committed to fund
additional capital contributions of $22,429 to certain
investments in limited partnerships.

The Company had fixed maturities carried at
$148,860 and $216,055 at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, on deposit with various governmental authorities
as required by law.

Security
Lending

The Company engages in transactions in which
fixed maturities, especially bonds issued by the United States
Government and Government agencies and authorities, are loaned
to selected broker/dealers. Collateral, greater than or equal to
102% of the fair value of the securities lent plus interest, is
received in the form of cash or marketable securities and held
by a custodian for the benefit of the Company. The Company
monitors the fair value of securities loaned and the collateral
received on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained
as necessary. The Company is subject to the risk of loss to the
extent that the loaned securities are not returned and the value
of the collateral is less than the market value of the
securities loaned. Management believes such an event is
unlikely. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, securities with a
fair value of $417,533 and $419,000, respectively, were on loan
to select brokers.

1997 Capital
Securities I & II

In May 1997, Fortis Capital Trust, a trust
declared and established by the Company and other parties,
issued 150,000 8.40% capital securities (the “1997 Capital
Securities I”) to purchasers and 4,640 8.40% common
securities (the “1997 Common Securities I”) to the
Company, in each case with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per
security. Fortis Capital Trust used the proceeds from the sale
of the 1997 Capital Securities I and the 1997 Common Securities
I to purchase $154,640 of the Company’s 8.40% junior
subordinated debentures due 2027 (the “1997 Junior
Subordinated Debentures I”). These debentures are the sole
assets of Fortis Capital Trust.

In July 1997, Fortis Capital Trust II, a
trust declared and established by the Company and other parties,
issued 50,000 7.94% capital securities (the “1997 Capital
Securities II” and, together with the 1997 Capital
Securities, the “1997 Capital Securities”) to
purchasers and 1,547 7.94% common securities (the “1997
Common Securities II”) to the Company, in each case with a
liquidation amount of $1,000 per security. Fortis Capital
Trust II used the proceeds from the sale of the 1997
Capital Securities II and the 1997 Common

of the outstanding $196,224 of 1997 Capital Securities. In
December 2003 the Company sent an irrevocable notice of
redemption for the 1997 capital securities; therefore, the
Company accrued interest premiums of $66,734 in 2003 and
expensed $2,088 of cost that was capitalized at the time of the
issuance of these securities and was being amortized over the
life of the securities. The interest premiums and capitalized
costs that were expensed are included in the interest premiums

9.     Debt

In December 2003, the Company entered into two
senior bridge credit facilities of $650,000 and $1,100,000. The
aggregate indebtedness of $1,750,000 under the facility was in
connection with the extinguishment of the Company’s
Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary
Trusts. See Note 8 for a detail description of these securities
and the repayment terms. The $1,750,000 aggregate indebtedness
under the senior bridge credit facility was paid in full in
January 2004. The interest expense of $1,175 related to the
senior bridge credit facility is included in the statement of
operations in 2003. See Note 25 — Subsequent
events for a detailed description of the repayment.

10.     Income
Taxes

The Company and the majority of its subsidiaries
are subject to U.S. tax and file a U.S. consolidated federal
income tax return. Information about current and deferred tax
expense follows:

The provision for foreign taxes includes amounts
attributable to income from U.S. possessions that are considered
foreign under U.S. tax laws. International operations of the
Company are subject to income taxes imposed by the jurisdiction
in which they operate.

A reconciliation of the federal income tax rate
to the Company’s effective income tax rate follows:

F-27


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The tax effects of temporary differences that
result in significant deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities are as follows:

Deferred taxes have not been provided on the
undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries
since the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest these
earnings. The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings for
which the Company has not provided deferred income taxes is
approximately $161,853. Upon distribution of such earnings in a
taxable event, the Company would incur additional U.S. income
taxes of approximately $40,000 net of anticipated foreign tax
credits.

Under pre-1984 life insurance company income tax
laws, a portion of a life insurance company’s “gain
from operations” was not subject to current income taxation
but was accumulated, for tax purposes, in a memorandum account
designated as “policyholders’ surplus account.”
Amounts in this account only become taxable upon the occurrence
of certain events. The approximate amount in this account was
$95,163 at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Deferred taxes have
not been provided on amounts in this account since the Company
neither contemplates any action nor foresees any events
occurring that would create such tax.

At December 31, 2003, the Company and its
subsidiaries had capital loss carryforwards for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Capital loss carryforwards total $91,702
and will expire if unused as follows:

11.     Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Stocks

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Fortis, Inc.
had three classes of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock:
Series A, Series B and Series C. There were
10,000 Series A shares authorized and none issued or
outstanding at December 31, 2003. There were 30,000
Series B shares authorized and 19,160 shares issued and
outstanding at December 31, 2003. There were 5,000
Series C shares authorized, issued and outstanding at
December 31, 2003. In connection with the merger of Fortis,
Inc and Assurant, Inc., each share of the

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

existing Series B and Series C
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of Fortis, Inc. was
exchanged for one share of Series B and C mandatorily
redeemable preferred stock of Assurant, Inc. and all terms of
the stock remained the same. The series A class was retired
at the time of the merger and does not exist in Assurant, Inc.

The carrying value equals the redemption value
for all classes of preferred stock. The Company’s board of
directors has the authority to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, in one or more
series and to fix the powers, preferences, rights and
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, which may
include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms
of redemption, liquidation preferences and the number of shares
constituting any series or the designations of the series.

Information about the preferred stock is as
follows:

There was no change in the outstanding shares of
Series C for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001. Changes in the number of Series B shares
outstanding are as follows:

All shares have a liquidation price of $1,000 per
share and rank senior to common stock with respect to rights to
receive dividends and to receive distributions upon the
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

Series B and C: Holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at
the rate of 4.0% per share per annum, multiplied by the $1,000
per share liquidation price, and holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends at the rate of
4.5% per share per annum multiplied by the $1,000 per share
liquidation price. All dividends are payable in arrears on a
quarterly basis. Any dividend that is not paid on a specified
dividend payment date with respect to a share of such Preferred
Stock shall be deemed added to the liquidation price of such
share for purposes of computing the future dividends on such
share, until such delinquent dividend has been paid.

Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock may
elect to have any or all of their shares redeemed by the Company
at any time after April 1, 2002, and the Company must
redeem all shares of the Series B Preferred Stock no later
than July 1, 2017. Holders of the Series C Preferred
Stock may elect to have any or all of their shares redeemed by
the Company any time after April 1, 2022, and the Company
must redeem all shares of the Series C Preferred Stock no
later than July 1, 2027. The Company also has the right and
the obligation to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock and
Series C Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain
specified events. The redemption price in all cases shall equal
the $1,000 per share liquidation price plus all accumulated and
unpaid dividends. The Company is not required to establish any
sinking fund or similar funds with respect to such redemptions.
None of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Series C
Preferred Stock are convertible into common stock or any other
equity security of the Company. However, holders of the

Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote per share owned of
record on all matters voted upon by the Company stockholders,
voting with the holders of common stock as a single class, and
not as a separate class or classes. The shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock are subject to
certain restrictions on transferability, and the Company has the
right of first refusal to acquire the shares if any holder
thereof desires to make a transfer not otherwise permitted by
the terms thereof.

12.     Stockholders’
Equity

Common
Stock

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Fortis, Inc.
had three classes of common stock, Class A, B and C. There
were 40,000,000 shares authorized, 7,750,000 shares
issued and outstanding of Class A common stock;
150,001 shares authorized, issued and outstanding of
Class B common stock; 400,001 shares authorized,
issued and outstanding of Class C common stock.

In connection with the merger of Fortis, Inc. and
Assurant, Inc., each share of Fortis, Inc. Class A common
stock was exchanged for 10.75882039 shares of common stock
of Assurant, Inc., which totaled 83,380,858 shares. Also,
the Class B common stock and Class C common stock
outstanding were converted into an aggregate of
25,841,418 shares of common stock of Assurant, Inc. These
events resulted in 109,222,276 shares of common stock
outstanding.

In connection with the IPO the Company issued
32,976,854 shares of common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V.
in exchange for $725,500 capital contribution. The Company also
issued 68,976 shares to certain officers of the Company.
These events resulted in 142,268,106 shares of common stock
outstanding as of February 5, 2004.

The Company is authorized to issue
800,000,000 shares of common stock. The 150,001 shares
of Class B and 400,001 shares of Class C common
stock, per the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
Assurant, Inc., are still authorized but have not been retired
and it’s management intent not to reissue these shares.

Preferred
Stock

The Board of Directors of the Company has
designated Preferred Stock shares as Series B and
Series C (see Note 11).

13.     Statutory
Information

The Company’s insurance subsidiaries prepare
financial statements on the basis of statutory accounting
practices (“SAP”) prescribed or permitted by the
insurance departments of their states of domicile. Prescribed
SAP includes the Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual of
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and
administrative rules.

The principal differences between SAP and GAAP
are: 1) policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred under
SAP, but are deferred and amortized under GAAP; 2) the value of
business acquired is not capitalized under SAP but is under
GAAP; 3) amounts collected from holders of universal life-type
and annuity products are recognized as premiums when collected
under SAP, but are initially recorded as contract deposits under
GAAP, with cost of insurance recognized as revenue when assessed
and other contract charges recognized over the periods for which
services are provided; 4) the classification and carrying
amounts of investments in certain securities are different under
SAP than under GAAP; 5) the criteria for providing asset
valuation allowances, and the methodologies used to determine
the amounts thereof, are different under SAP than under GAAP; 6)
the timing of establishing certain reserves, and the
methodologies used to determine the amounts thereof, are
different under SAP than under GAAP; 7) certain assets are not
admitted for purposes of determining surplus under SAP; and 8)
the criteria for obtaining reinsurance accounting treatment is
different under SAP than under GAAP.

F-30


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The combined statutory net income and capital and
surplus of the insurance subsidiaries follow:

Insurance enterprises are required by state
insurance departments to adhere to minimum risk-based capital
(“RBC”) requirements developed by the NAIC. All of the
Company’s insurance subsidiaries exceed minimum RBC
requirements.

The payment of dividends to the Company by the
Company’s insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain
amount (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the
subsidiaries’ domiciliary state department of insurance.
Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is
generally required, are limited to amounts determined by
formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of
the states in which the Company’s subsidiaries are
domiciled is the lesser of (i) 10% of the statutory surplus
as of the end of the prior year or (ii) the prior
year’s statutory net income. In some states the formula is
the greater amount of clauses (i) and (ii). Some states,
however, have an additional stipulation that dividends may only
be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine
that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by
the Company’s insurance subsidiaries to the Company (such
as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for
employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or
creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would
otherwise be permitted without prior approval. As part of the
regulatory approval process for the acquisition of American
Bankers Insurance Group (“ABIG”) in 1999, the Company
entered into an agreement with the Florida Insurance Department
pursuant to which American Bankers Insurance Company and
American Bankers Life Assurance Company have agreed to limit the
amount of ordinary dividends they would pay to the Company to an
amount no greater than 50% of the amount otherwise permitted
under Florida law. This agreement expires in August 2004. In
addition, the Company entered into an agreement with the New
York Insurance Department as part of the regulatory approval
process for the merger of Bankers American Life Assurance
Company, one of the Company’s New York-domiciled insurance
subsidiaries, into First Fortis Life Insurance Company
(“FFLIC”) in 2001, pursuant to which FFLIC agreed not
to pay any dividends to the Company until fiscal year 2004. No
assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory
actions restricting the ability of the Company’s insurance
subsidiaries to pay dividends. Based on the dividend
restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the maximum
amount of dividends that the Company’s subsidiaries could
pay to the Company in 2004 without regulatory approval is
approximately $302,000 (Unaudited).

14.     Reinsurance

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
is involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance
with non-affiliated companies. The following table provides
details of the reinsurance recoverables balance for the years
ended December 31:

F-31


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The effect of reinsurance on premiums earned and
benefits incurred was as follows:

The Company had $624,044 of invested assets held
in trusts or by custodians as of December 31, 2003 for the
benefit of others related to certain reinsurance arrangements.

The Company utilizes ceded reinsurance for loss
protection and capital management, business dispositions, and in
the Solutions’ segment, for client risk and profit sharing.

Loss
Protection and Capital Management

As part of the Company’s overall risk and
capacity management strategy, the Company purchases reinsurance
for certain risks underwritten by the Company’s various
segments, including significant individual or catastrophic
claims, and to free up capital to enable the Company to write
additional business.

For those product lines where there is exposure
to catastrophes, the Company closely monitors and manages the
aggregate risk exposure by geographic area and the Company has
entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these
types of events.

Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which
the Company is the ceding insurer, the Company remains liable
for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its
obligations. To limit this risk, the Company has control
procedures in place to evaluate the financial condition of
reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to
minimize this exposure. The selection of reinsurance companies
is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to
a lesser degree, diversification as well as on developing strong
relationships with the Company’s reinsurers for the sharing
of risks.

Business
Divestitures

The Company has used reinsurance to exit certain
businesses, such as the disposals of FFG (see note 4) and
LTC. Reinsurance was used in these cases to facilitate the
transactions because the businesses shared legal entities with
business segments that the Company retained. Assets backing
liabilities ceded related to these businesses are held in trusts
for the benefit of the Company and the separate accounts
relating to FFG are still reflected in the Company’s
balance sheet.

The reinsurance recoverable from The Hartford was
$1,536,568 and $1,557,660 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The reinsurance recoverable from John Hancock was
$873,477 and $697,365 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company would be responsible for administering
this business

F-32


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in the event of a default by reinsurers. In
addition, under the reinsurance agreement, The Hartford is
obligated to contribute funds to increase the value of the
separate accounts relating to the business sold if such value
declines. If The Hartford fails to fulfill these obligations,
the Company will be obligated to make these payments.

Solutions’
Segment Client Risk and Profit Sharing

The Assurant Solutions segment writes business
produced by its clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers
and financial institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of
such business to insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such
arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the
sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business.

A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions’
reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure
premiums generated by certain clients to the clients’ own
captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in
which the clients have an ownership interest. Collateral is
generally obtained in amounts equal to the outstanding reserves
when captive companies are not authorized to operate in the
Company’s insurance subsidiary’s state of domicile as
required by statutory accounting principles.

The Company’s reinsurance agreements do not
relieve the Company from its direct obligation to its insureds.
Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer
is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance
agreements. To minimize its exposure to reinsurance
insolvencies, the Company evaluates the financial condition of
its reinsurers and holds substantial collateral (in the form of
funds, trusts, and letters of credit) as security under the
reinsurance agreements.

15.     Reserves

The following table provides reserve information
by the Company’s major lines of business at the dates shown:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The following table provides a roll forward of
the claims and benefits payable for the Company’s group
term life, group disability, medical and property and warranty
lines of business. These are the Company’s product lines
with the most significant short duration claims and benefits
payable balances. The majority of the Company’s credit life
and disability claims and benefits payable are ceded to
reinsurers. The Company’s net retained credit life and
disability claims and benefits payable were $129,406, $134,715
and $191,343 at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

(1)

The “other” in reinsurance ceded and
    other included $13,300 and $10,500 in 2002 and 2001,
    respectively, of liability balances primarily related to Medical
    Savings Accounts. In 2003, Medical Savings Accounts were
    transferred to an external third party administrator.

(2)

Represents claims and benefits payable balances
    assumed as part of the DBD acquisition.

The claims and benefits payable include claims in
process as well as provisions for incurred but not reported
claims. Such amounts are developed using actuarial principles
and assumptions that consider, among other things, contractual
requirements, historical utilization trends and payment
patterns, benefits changes, medical inflation, seasonality,
membership, product mix, legislative and regulatory environment,
economic factors, disabled life mortality and claim termination
rates and other relevant factors. The Company

F-35


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

consistently applies the principles and
assumptions listed above from year to year, while also giving
due consideration to the potential variability of these factors.

Because claims and benefits payable include
estimates developed from various actuarial methods, the
Company’s actual losses incurred may be more or less than
the Company’s previously developed estimates. As shown in
the table above, for each of the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 the amounts listed on the line labeled
“Incurred losses related to: Prior year” are negative
(redundant) for the Group Term Life and Medical lines of
business. This means that the Company’s actual losses
incurred related to prior years for these lines were less than
the estimates previously made by the Company. For Group
Disability, the amounts listed are negative (redundant) for
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and positive
(deficient) for the year ended December 31, 2003. This
means that for 2002 and 2001, the Company’s actual losses
incurred related to prior years for this line were less than
what was estimated, while for 2003, actual losses incurred
related to prior years were greater than what was previously
estimated by the Company.

The Group Disability reserve deficiency in 2003,
and its related upward revision reflects the result of reserve
adequacy studies concluded in the third quarter of 2003. Based
on results of those studies, reserves were increased by $44,000,
almost all of which was attributable to a reduction in the
discount rate to reflect current yields on invested assets. The
Group Disability reserve redundancies in 2002 and 2001, which
were less than 1% of prior year reserves, arose as a result of
our actual claim recovery rates exceeding those assumed in our
beginning-of-year case reserves, after taking into account an
offset of one less year of discounting reflected in the
Company’s end-of-year case reserves.

The Group Term Life reserve redundancy in 2003,
and its related downward revision reflects the results of
reserve adequacy studies conducted in the third quarter of 2003.
Based on the results of those studies, reserves were reduced by
$59,000. The change in estimate reflects an increase in the
discount rate, lower mortality rates and higher recovery rates.
These changes were made to reflect current yields on invested
assets, and recent mortality and recovery experience. Another
portion of the Group Term Life reserve redundancies in all years
was caused by actual mortality rates being lower than assumed in
our beginning-of-year reserves and recovery rates being higher
than assumed in our beginning-of-year waiver of premium
reserves. The remaining redundancy and related downward revision
were due to shorter-than-expected lags between incurred claim
dates and paid claim dates. These amounts were offset by one
less year of discounting reflected in the Company’s
end-of-year waiver of premium reserves.

The conclusion of the reserve studies determined
that, in the aggregate, the reserves were redundant. The reserve
discount rate on all claims was changed to reflect the
continuing low interest rate environment. The net impact of
these adjustments was a reduction in reserves of approximately
$18,000, which includes $3,000 of reserve release relating to
the group dental business.

The redundancies in our Medical line of business,
and the related downward revisions in the Company’s Medical
reserve estimates, were caused by the Company’s claims
developing more favorably than expected. The Company’s
actual claims experience reflected lower medical provider
utilization and lower medical inflation than assumed in the
Company’s prior-year pricing and reserving processes.

The redundancy in the Company’s Property and
Warranty lines of business, and the related downward revision in
the Company’s estimated reserves in 2001 occurred mostly in
the Company’s credit unemployment and credit property
insurance coverages, whereas the other coverages showed
immaterial adjustments to prior year incurred losses. The small
deficiency in 2002 largely reflected a shift in the mix of
business away from the credit property and unemployment product
lines. In addition, an increase in the claim frequency of
unemployment contributed to additional development and the small
deficiency experienced in 2002. In 2003, unemployment claim
frequencies stabilized, contributing to a modest redundancy.
These changes reflect experience gains and losses from actual
claim frequencies differing from best estimate claim
frequencies, and differences in actual versus best estimate paid
claim lag rates.

For the longer-tail Property and Warranty
coverages (e.g. asbestos, environmental, other general liability
and personal accident), there were no changes in estimated
amounts for incurred claims in prior years for all years.

Long Duration
Contracts

The Company’s long duration contracts are
comprised of pre-funded funeral life insurance policies and
annuity contracts, life insurance policies no longer offered,
universal life and annuities no longer offered and FFG and LTC
disposed businesses. The principal products and services
included in these categories are described in the summary of
significant accounting polices (see note 2).

The Company’s PreNeed segment distributes
pre-funded funeral insurance products through two separate
divisions, the independent division and the AMLIC division. The
reserves for future policy benefits and expenses for pre-funded
funeral life and annuity contracts and life insurance no longer
offered by the PreNeed segment differ by division and are
established based upon the following assumptions:

PreNeed
Segment — Independent Division

Interest and discount rates for pre-funded
funeral life insurance are level, vary by year of issuance and
product, and ranged from 7.0% to 7.3% in 2003 and 2002 before
provisions for adverse deviation, which ranged from 0.2% to 0.5%
in both 2003 and 2002.

Interest and discount rates for pre-funded life
insurance no longer offered vary by year of issuance and
products and were 7.5% grading to 5.3% over 20 years in
2003 and 2002 with the exception of a block of pre-1980 business
which had a level 8.8% discount rate in both 2003 and 2002.

Mortality assumptions are based upon pricing
assumptions and modified to allow provisions for adverse
deviation. Surrender rates vary by product and are based upon
pricing assumptions. The weighted average lapse rate, including
surrenders, for all life policies issued by the independent
channel was approximately 2.7% and 3.2% in 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Future policy benefit increases on pre-funded
life insurance policies ranged from 1.0% to 7.0% in 2003 and
2002. Some policies have future policy benefit increases, which
are guaranteed or tied to equal some measure of inflation. The
inflation assumption for these inflation-linked benefits was
3.0% in 2003 and 2002. Traditional life products issued by the
PreNeed segment have level benefits.

The reserves for annuities issued by the
independent division are based on assumed interest rates
credited on deferred annuities, which vary by year of issuance,
and ranged from 2.5% to 5.5% in 2003 and 2002. Withdrawal
charges, if any, generally range from 7.0% to 0%, grading to
zero over a period of seven years for business issued in the
United States. Canadian annuity products have a surrender charge
that varies by product series and premium paying period,
typically grading to zero after all premiums have been paid.

PreNeed
Segment — AMLIC Division

Interest and discount rates for pre-funded
funeral life insurance policies issued October 2000 and beyond
vary by issue year and are based on pricing assumptions and
modified to allow for provisions for adverse deviation. 2003
issues used a level 4.8% discount rate, 2002 issues used a level
5.8% discount rate and 2001 issues used a discount rate of 6.0%.
Pre-funded funeral life insurance policies issued prior to
October 2000 and all traditional life policies issued by the
AMLIC division use discount rates, which vary by issue year and
product and ranged from 2.5% to 7.5% in 2003 and 2002.

Mortality assumptions for pre-funded funeral life
insurance products issued in October 2000 and beyond are based
upon pricing assumptions, which approximate actual experience,
and modified to allow for provisions for adverse deviation.
Surrender rates for pre-funded funeral life insurance products
issued in

F-37


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

October 2000 and beyond vary by product and are
based upon pricing assumptions, which approximate actual
experience. Mortality assumptions for all prefunded funeral life
insurance and traditional life insurance issued by the AMLIC
division prior to October 2000 are based on Statutory valuation
requirements with no explicit provision for lapses. The weighted
average lapse rate, including surrenders, for all life policies
issued by the AMLIC division was approximately 1.0% and 1.1% in
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Future policy benefit increases are based upon
pricing assumptions. First-year guaranteed benefit increases
range from 0.0% to 6.0% in 2003 and 2002. Renewal guaranteed
benefit increases range from 0.0% to 3.0% in 2003 and 2002. For
contracts with minimum benefit increases associated with an
inflation index, assumed benefit increases equaled the discount
rate less 3.0% in 2003 and 2002.

The reserves for annuities issued by the AMLIC
division are based on assumed interest rates credited on
deferred annuities and ranged from 1.0% to 6.5% in 2003 and
2002. Withdrawal charges ranged from 0.0% to 8.0% grading to
zero over eight years for business issued in the United States.
Canadian annuity products have a flat 35% surrender charge.
Nearly all the deferred annuities contracts have a 3.0%
guaranteed interest rate.

Universal
Life and Annuities — No Longer Offered

The reserves for universal life and annuity
products no longer offered in the Assurant Solutions segment
have been established based on the following assumptions:
Interest rates credited on annuities, which vary by product and
time when funds were received, and ranged from 3.5% to 4.0% in
2003 and were universally 4.0% in 2002. Guaranteed crediting
rates on annuities range from 3.5% to 4.0%. Annuities are also
subject to surrender charges, which vary by contract year and
grade to zero over a period no longer than seven years.
Surrender values will never be less than the amount of paid-in
premiums (net of prior withdrawals) regardless of the surrender
charge. Credited interest rates on universal life funds vary by
product and the funds received ranged from 4.0% to 5.5% in 2003
and 2002. Guaranteed crediting rates where present are equal to
4.0%. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to
surrender charges that vary by product, age, sex, year of issue,
risk class, face amount and grade to zero over a period not
longer than 20 years.

FFG and
LTC

A description of the disposal of FFG can be found
in the dispositions footnote (see note 4). The reserves for FFG
and LTC are included in the Company’s reserves in
accordance with FAS 113,

Accounting and Reporting for
Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts.

The Company maintains an offsetting reinsurance recoverable
related to these reserves (see note 14).

Short
Duration Contracts

The Company’s short duration contracts are
comprised of group term life, group disability, medical and
dental, property, credit, warranty and all other. The principal
products and services included in these categories are described
in the summary of significant accounting polices (see note 2).

The disability category includes short and long
term disability products. Claims and benefits payable for
long-term disability have been discounted at 5.25% in 2003. The
December 31, 2003 and 2002 liabilities include $1,318,186
and $1,201,592, respectively, of such reserves. The amount of
discounts deducted from outstanding reserves as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002 are $440,460 and $460,937,
respectively.

16.     Fair Value
Disclosures

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 107,

Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

(“FAS 107”) requires disclosure of
fair value information about financial instruments, as defined
therein, for which it is practicable to estimate such fair
value. These financial instruments may or may not be recognized
in the consolidated balance sheets. In the measurement of the
fair value of certain financial

F-38


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

instruments, if quoted market prices were not
available other valuation techniques were utilized. These
derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by the
assumptions used. Additionally, FAS 107 excludes certain
financial instruments including those related to insurance
contracts.

In estimating the fair value of the financial
instruments presented, the Company used the following methods
and assumptions:

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments:

the carrying amount
reported approximates fair value because of the short maturity
of the instruments.

Fixed maturity securities:

the fair value for fixed maturity
securities is based on quoted market prices, where available.
For fixed maturity securities not actively traded, fair values
are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing
services or, in the case of private placements, are estimated by
discounting expected future cash flows using a current market
rate applicable to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of
the investments.

Equity securities:

fair value of equity securities and
non-sinking fund preferred stocks is based upon quoted market
prices.

Commercial mortgage loans and policy loans:

the fair values of mortgage loans are
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on interest
rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers
with similar credit ratings. Mortgage loans with similar
characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations.
The carrying amounts of policy loans reported in the balance
sheets approximate fair value.

Other investments:

the fair values of joint ventures are
calculated based on fair market value appraisals. The invested
assets related to the modified coinsurance arrangements are
classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value.
The carrying amounts of the remaining other investments
approximate fair value.

Policy reserves under investment products:

the fair values for the Company’s
policy reserves under the investment products are determined
using cash surrender value.

Separate account assets and liabilities:

separate account assets and
liabilities are reported at their estimated fair values in the
balance sheet.

F-39


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of the Company’s liabilities
for insurance contracts other than investment-type contracts are
not required to be disclosed. However, the fair values of
liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into
consideration in the Company’s overall management of
interest rate risk, such that the Company’s exposure to
changing interest rates is minimized through the matching of
investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.

17.     Retirement
and Other Employee Benefits

The Company and its subsidiaries participate in a
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all of their employees. Benefits are based on
certain years of service and the employee’s compensation
during certain such years of service. The Company’s funding
policy is to contribute amounts to the plan sufficient to meet
the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional
amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate from time
to time up to the maximum permitted. Contributions are intended
to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date,
but also for those expected to be earned in the future. The
Company also has noncontributory, nonqualified supplemental
programs covering certain employees.

In addition, the Company provides certain life
and healthcare benefits for retired employees and their
dependents. Substantially all employees of the Company may
become eligible for these benefits depending on age and years of
service. The Company has the right to modify or terminate these
benefits.

Summarized information on the Company’s
qualified pension benefits and postretirement plans for the
years ended December 31 is as follows:

The curtailment and settlement gains in 2001
resulted from the sale of FFG (see note 4).

The Company’s nonqualified plans are

plans had projected benefit obligations of $71,634, $64,118 and
$52,790 respectively, and accumulated benefit obligations of
$62,176, $53,511 and $44,495, respectively. A minimum pension
liability of $5,750 for these plans was also recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income in 2003 and 2002.

Determination of the projected benefit obligation
was based on the following weighted average assumptions at
December 31:

Determination of the net periodic benefit cost
was based on the following weighted average assumptions for the
year ended December 31:

(1)

7.75% for the first three months of 2001 and
    7.50% for the last nine months of 2001.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return
on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level
of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily
government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium
associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio
is invested and the expectations for future returns of each
asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then
weighted based on the targeted asset allocation to develop the
expected long-term rate of return on asset assumptions for the
portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 8.25%
assumption for the fiscal year 2003 and 2002, and 9.00% for the
fiscal year 2001.

Assumed health care cost trend rates at
December 31:

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost
trend rates would have the following effects:

December 31 by asset category are as follows:

The goals of the asset strategy are to determine
if the growth in the value of the fund over the long-term, both
in real and nominal terms and manage (control) risk
exposure. Risk is managed by investing in a broad range of asset
classes, and within those asset classes, a broad range of
individual securities.

The Investment Committee that oversees the
investment of the plan assets conducted a review of the
Investment Strategies and Policies of the Plan in the 4th
quarter of 2001. This included a review of the strategic asset
allocation, including the relationship of the Plan liabilities
and portfolio structure. As a result of this review, the
Investment Committee has adopted a target asset allocation and
modified the ranges:

The equity securities category includes both
domestic and foreign equity securities. The target asset equity
security allocation of U.S. and foreign securities is 60% and
15%, respectively.

The Company expects to contribute $11,000 to its
pension plans and $1,200 to its retirement health benefit plan
in 2004.

The following benefit payments, which reflect
expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

The Company and its subsidiaries have a defined
contribution plan covering substantially all employees which
provides benefits payable to participants on retirement or
disability and to beneficiaries of participants in the event of
the participant’s death. Amounts contributed to the plan
and expensed by the Company were $24,684, $23,669 and $21,792 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

20.     Segment
Information

The Company has five reportable segments, which
are defined based on the nature of the products and services
offered: Solutions, Health, Employee Benefits, PreNeed, and
Corporate and Other. Solutions provides credit insurance,
including life, disability and unemployment, debt protection
administration services, creditor-placed homeowners insurance
and manufactured housing homeowners insurance. Health provides
individual, short-term and small group health insurance.
Employee Benefits provides employee-paid dental insurance and
employer-paid dental, disability and life insurance products and
related services. PreNeed provides life insurance policies and
annuity products that provide benefits to fund pre-arranged
funerals. Corporate and Other includes activities of the holding
company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses) on
investments, interest income earned from short-term investments
held and interest income from excess surplus of insurance
subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. Corporate and
Other also includes results of operations of FFG, from
January 1, 2001 to March 31, 2001, the period prior to
its disposition. Corporate and Other also includes the
amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of
the sales of FFG and LTC (a business sold on March 1, 2000)
through reinsurance agreements.

The Company evaluates performance based on
segment income after-tax excluding impairments and amortization
of goodwill. The Company determines reportable segments in a
manner consistent with the way the Company organizes for
purposes of making operating decisions and assessing
performance. The accounting policies of the reportable segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies (See note 2).

The Company allocates a notional amount of
invested assets to the segments primarily based on future policy
benefits, claims and unearned premiums and capital allocated to
each segment. The Company assigns net deferred acquisition
costs, value of businesses acquired, reinsurance recoverables
and other assets and liabilities to the respective segments
where those assets or liabilities originate.

Net investment income is allocated based on a
segment’s proportional share of assets and capital required
to support its business.

In August 2003, the Company began to utilize
derivative instruments in managing the PreNeed segment’s
exposure to inflation risk. The derivative instrument, a
Consumer Price Index Cap (the “CPI CAP”), limits the
inflation risk on certain policies to a maximum of 5% and has a
notional amount of $454,000 amortizing to zero over
20 years. The CPI CAP does not qualify under GAAP as an
effective hedge; therefore, it is marked-to-marked on a
quarterly basis and the accumulated gain or loss is recognized
in the results of operations in fees and other income. As of
December 31, 2003, the CPI CAP included in other assets
amounted to $8,800 and the income recorded in the results of
operations totaled $100.

Incentive Plans

Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan
    (“AAIR Plan”):

Since January 1, 1999, the Company has
maintained the Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan
(formerly the Fortis Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan), which
provides key employees with the right to receive long-term
incentive cash compensation based on the appreciation in value
of incentive units of the Company and incentive units of each of
its operating business segments. The AAIR Plan is administered
by a committee appointed by the Company’s board of
directors. See note 25 for subsequent amendments to the
AAIR Plan.

The Company accounts for the AAIR Plan as a
variable plan in accordance with the provisions of APB 25
and its interpretations. Therefore, compensation expense is
recognized based on the intrinsic value method.

The value of each right is based on an
independent valuation of the Company performed by a qualified
appraiser. Each year, the appraiser determines a fair market
value for Assurant, Inc. and the individual business
segments. Based on this valuation, “phantom share
prices” are established for Assurant, Inc. and each
business segment. These share prices are calculated by dividing
the market value of Assurant, Inc. or a business segment by
the number of outstanding “phantom shares” in
Assurant, Inc. or in that segment.

The phantom share price established for a given
grant year becomes the strike price for that year and the
exercise price for prior grant years. When the phantom share
price determined by subsequent annual valuations increases above
the strike price, the rights accrue intrinsic value that will be
paid in cash when exercised.

Employees of Assurant, Inc. receive 75% of
their award value in Assurant, Inc. incentive rights and
the remaining 25% in equal portions of incentive rights from the
business segments. Segment participants receive 75% of their
award value from their own particular business segment and 25%
from Assurant, Inc.

F-49


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The incentive rights vest over a three-year
period from the date of grant and are exercisable for a period
of 7 years from the date the rights are fully vested.
Unexercised vested incentive rights are exercised automatically
following the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. If upon
expiration of the award the strike price is below the exercise
price, then the award is automatically forfeited.

The Company recognized $27,072, $19,570, and
$7,605 of compensation expense for the AAIR Plan in 2003, 2002,
and 2001, respectively.

Upon the closing of the IPO, the AAIR Plan was
amended to provide for the cash-out and replacement of
Assurant, Inc. incentive rights with stock appreciation
rights on the Assurant common stock. The business segment rights
outstanding under the plan were not changed or effected. The
conversion of outstanding Assurant, Inc. incentive rights
occurred as described in this paragraph. The Assurant, Inc.
incentive rights were valued as of December 31, 2003 using
a special valuation method, as follows. The measurement value of
each Assurant, Inc. incentive right as of December 31,
2002, was adjusted to reflect dividends paid by
Assurant, Inc., consistent with past practices; such
adjusted value was then multiplied by the arithmetic average of
the change during calendar year 2003 in the Dow Jones Life
Insurance Index, the Dow Jones Property Casualty Index, and the
Dow Jones Healthcare Providers Index; and the result became the
measurement value of Assurant, Inc. incentive rights as of
December 31, 2003.

On January 18, 2004, each
Assurant, Inc. incentive right then outstanding under the
plan was cashed out for a cash payment equal to the difference,
if any, between the measurement value of the Assurant, Inc.
incentive rights as of December 31st immediately
preceding the date of grant, and the measurement value of that
right determined as of December 31, 2003, pursuant to the
special valuation. Each outstanding Assurant, Inc.
incentive right, whether or not vested, was cancelled effective
as of the date it was cashed out. Following the cash-out and
cancellation of Assurant, Inc. incentive rights, Assurant
granted to each participant whose rights were cashed out a
number of stock appreciation rights on Assurant’s common
stock (referred to as “replacement rights”). The
number of replacement rights granted to a participant was equal
(1) the measurement value of the participant’s
cashed-out Assurant, Inc. incentive rights, divided by
(2) the IPO price of $22 a share. Each replacement right
that replaces a vested cashed-out right was vested immediately,
and each replacement right that replaces a non-vested cashed-out
right will become vested on the vesting date for the
corresponding cashed-out right, but no replacement right,
whether or not vested, may be exercised sooner than one year
from the closing date of the IPO. After that waiting period,
each replacement right will be exercisable for the remaining
term of the corresponding cancelled right.

Stock Option Plan

In contemplation of the IPO, the Company’s
Stock Option Plan was terminated effective as of
September 22, 2003, and all stock options thereunder were
cancelled in exchange for a payment of the fair value of such
options, as determined by an independent third party. Payments
totaling $2,237 were made in the fourth quarter. There is no
further obligation associated with the Company’s Stock
Option Plan.

The Company accounted for the Stock Option Plan
as a variable plan in accordance with the provisions of
APB 25 and its interpretations. Therefore, compensation
expense was recognized based on the intrinsic value method.
Compensation cost charged to income was $0, $0, and $(1,081)
(represents reversal of expense accrual due to reduction of
intrinsic value) for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

below:

Assurant Investment Plan
    (“AIP”)

The Company has adopted the AIP (formerly the
Fortis Investment Plan), which provides key employees the
ability to exchange a portion of their compensation for options
to purchase certain third-party mutual funds. The plan became
effective as of January 1, 1999 and is administered by the
Company’s Senior Vice President-Compensation and Benefits,
who is referred to as the administrator. Under the AIP, a
participant may exchange all or a portion of his or her eligible
compensation for a specific number of options under the plan.
Each option represents the right to purchase shares of Company
designated third-party mutual funds, as selected by the
participant. Each option is fully vested and exercisable on the
grant date. Options may not be exercised more than twice in any
calendar year, except with the consent of the administrator. For
most options, the exercise period generally will expire
120 months after the participant’s death, disability
or retirement or 60 months after the participant’s
termination of employment for any other reason. Until the
options are exercised, a participant may instruct the
administrator to exchange some or all of the options to purchase
different underlying mutual fund units. Employee compensation
exchanged for options is included as compensation expense prior
to the exchange. Subsequent to the exchange, the Company
accounts for invested assets in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standard 115,

Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

and as such, the
Company marks-to-market the AIP investment balances on a
quarterly basis. This quarterly mark-to-market adjustment
equally impacts the AIP investment and the AIP liability
balance. When options are exercised, the investment and
liability balances are reduced accordingly. The amounts included
in other investments and other liabilities were $57,451 and
$46,620 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Related Party Transactions

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
has entered into a number of agreements with Fortis.

Historically, Fortis maintained a $1,000,000
commercial paper facility that prior to the IPO the Company had
been able to access (via intercompany loans) for up to $750,000.
The Company has used the commercial paper facility to cover any
cash shortfalls, which may occur from time to time. In
mid-December 2003, the Company used the commercial paper
facility in the amount of $74,991 for three days to cover a cash
shortfall in the early extinguishment of the Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust. There were
no intercompany loans with Fortis associated with this
commercial paper facility during 2002. The Company had no
outstanding intercompany loans with Fortis related to this
commercial paper facility at year-end December 31, 2003 and
2002.

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid
$644, $749, and $516, respectively, to Fortis for costs
representing salary, benefits and other expenses of a director
of the Company, who was then an employee of a Fortis subsidiary,
and his support staff. The Company discontinued these payments
as of October 3, 2003.

The other related party transactions are
disclosed in notes 1, 8, 11, 12, and 25.

certain employee benefit programs as follows:

2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan

The 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan was effective
on February 5, 2004.

The 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes the
granting of awards to employees, officers, and directors in the
following forms: (1) options to purchase shares of
Assurant’s common stock, which may be non-statutory stock
options or incentive stock options under the U.S. tax code;
(2) stock appreciation rights, which give the holder the
right to receive the difference between the fair market value
per share on the date of exercise over the grant price;
(3) performance awards, which are payable in cash or stock
upon the attainment of specified performance goals;
(4) restricted stock, which is subject to restrictions on
transferability and subject to forfeiture on terms set by the
Compensation Committee; (5) dividend equivalents, which
entitle the participant to payments equal to any dividends paid
on the shares of stock underlying an award; and (6) other
stock-based awards in the discretion of the Compensation
Committee, including unrestricted stock grants.

There are 10,000,000 shares reserved and
available for issuance under the plan.

ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Upon the closing of the IPO, 68,976 shares
of common stock of Assurant, Inc. were granted to certain
officers of the Company on February 5, 2004. Any awards
will be made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

Executive Management Incentive
    Plan

The Executive Management Incentive Plan went into
effect January 1, 2004. Participation in the Executive
Management Incentive Plan is limited to senior officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries who are selected to participate in
the plan for a given year by the Compensation Committee. The
plan provides for the payment of annual monetary awards to each
participant equal to a percentage of such participant’s
base salary based upon the achievement of certain designated
performance goals. The amount of awards under the plan will be
determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

Assurant IPO

See note 1 and 21 for a discussion of the
IPO, merger and related activities.

The Company issued 32,976,854 shares to
Fortis Insurance N.V. simultaneously with the closing of the IPO
in exchange for a $725,500 capital contribution. The Company
also issued 68,976 shares of Common Stock to certain
officers of the Company.

On February 5, 2004, the Company received a
$725,500 capital contribution from Fortis simultaneously with
the closing of the IPO. The proceeds from that contribution were
used to repay the $650,000 of outstanding indebtedness under the
senior bridge credit facility and $75,500 of outstanding
indebtedness under the $1,100,000 senior bridge credit facility.

Assurant Senior Notes

On February 18, 2004, the Company issued two
series of senior notes in an aggregate principal amount
$975,000. The first series is $500,000 in principal amount,
bears interest at 5.63% per year and is payable in a single
installment due February 15, 2014. The second series is
$475,000 in principal amount, bears interest at 6.75% per
year and is payable in a single installment due
February 15, 2034.

Interest on the senior notes is payable
semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each
year, commencing August 15, 2004. The senior notes are
unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the
Company’s other senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior
notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds
from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay the
remaining portion of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness
under the $1,100,000 senior bridge facility.

At the time of the offering of the Company’s
senior notes, the Company entered into a registration rights
agreement. The registration rights agreement requires the
Company to file a registration statement under the Securities
Act to permit the exchange of the senior notes for registered
notes having nearly identical terms as the senior notes or to
permit the registered resale of the senior notes. If the Company
fails to comply with the filing requirements under the
registration rights agreement within certain time periods, the
interest rates on the senior notes are subject to increase.

The Company is subject to several debt covenants
associated with these senior notes.

As of March 11, 2004, the Company is in
compliance with all of the covenants associated with these
senior notes.

On January 30, 2004, the Company entered
into a $500,000 senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of banks, which will be available for working capital
and other general corporate purposes. The revolving credit
facility is unsecured and is available until February 2007.

F-54


ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The revolving credit facility contains
restrictive covenants and also requires that the Company
maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds.

As of March 11, 2004, the Company is in
compliance with all of the covenants associated with this senior
revolving credit facility.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries lease office
space and equipment under operating lease arrangements. Certain
facility leases contain escalation clauses based on increases in
the lessors’ operating expenses. At December 31, 2003,
the aggregate future minimum lease payment under operating lease
agreements that have initial or non-cancelable terms in excess
of one year are:

Rent expense was $40,463, $43,412 and $32,546 for
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In the normal course of business, letters of
credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements.
These letters of credit are supported by commitments with
financial institutions. The Company had approximately $117,000
and $109,000 of letters of credit outstanding as of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2003, the Company had an
unused $50,000 letter of credit facility.

The Company is regularly involved in litigation
in the ordinary course of business, both as a defendant and as a
plaintiff. The Company may from time to time be subject to a
variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to the
Company’s current and past business operations. While the
Company cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future
litigation, examination or investigation, the Company does not
believe that any pending matter will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations.

The Solutions segment is subject to a number of
pending actions, primarily in the State of Mississippi, many of
which allege that the Company’s credit insurance products
were packaged and sold with lenders’ products without buyer
consent. The judicial climate in Mississippi is such that the
outcome of these cases is extremely unpredictable. The Company
has been advised by legal counsel that the Company has
meritorious defenses to all claims being asserted against the
Company. The Company believes, based on information currently
available, that the amounts accrued are adequate.

American Bankers Insurance Company, part of the
Solutions segment, on behalf of certain of its subsidiaries,
including American Bankers Insurance Company (“ABIC”)
and American Bankers Life Assurance Company (“ABLAC”)
previously entered into a Consent Order and a comprehensive
Compliance Plan with 43 participating states relating to
compliance with the often disparate state insurance laws,
regulations and administrative interpretations which have been
difficult to apply to the marketing of ABIG’s credit
insurance products through financial institutions, retailers and
other entities offering consumer financing as a regular part of
their business. In addition to an initial settlement of $12,000,
ABIG agreed to a multi-state market conduct examination
commencing November 23, 1999, for review of ABIG’s
implementation of the Compliance Plan. A final report was issued
on December 19, 2001, and ABIC paid a final settlement of
$3,000 to participating states.

ASSURANT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In February 2002, the State of Minnesota
initiated an enforcement action against ABIC and ABLAC, two of
the Company’s subsidiaries, in connection with certain
alleged regulatory violations. Thereafter, ABIC and ABLAC filed
suit in Minnesota state court seeking to enjoin the enforcement
action because the alleged regulatory matters included within
the enforcement action were resolved as a part of the
above-described Consent Order and Compliance Plan to which
Minnesota was a party. In February 2003, the State of Minnesota,
ABIC and ABLAC reached a final settlement of all matters
included within the enforcement action and the separate state
court action filed by ABIC and ABLAC. Pursuant to the
settlement, ABIC and ABLAC each agreed to pay $100 to the State
of Minnesota and agreed to compensate the state for its
investigative costs which totaled $1,800. In addition, ABIC and
ABLAC agreed to stop selling insurance in Minnesota for five
years, though it could apply for reinstatement in
20 months. Other member companies of the Solutions segment
with product lines that overlap those offered by ABIC and ABLAC
currently remain authorized to do business in the State of
Minnesota. The Company does not believe that the effect of the
settlement during the next five years will have a material
impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
its operations.

On October 1, 2003, a grand jury in Mower
County, Minnesota issued an indictment of ABIC and two corporate
officers of the Solutions segment. The indictment alleges that
ABIC and its two named corporate officers each violated the
Minnesota Fair Campaign Practices Act in connection with two
contributions by ABIC to the Republican National State Election
Committee totaling $15. The maximum penalty for ABIC is a $40
fine for each alleged violation and/or forfeiture of ABIC’s
license to conduct business in Minnesota. In addition, the
maximum monetary penalty for each officer would be $20 per
violation, which the Company may reimburse under certain
circumstances. Other member companies of the Solutions segment
with product lines that overlap those offered by ABIC currently
remain authorized to conduct business in the State of Minnesota.
ABIC believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims
being asserted against it, and the Company believes, based on
information currently available, that any liabilities that could
result are not expected to have a material effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, one of the Company’s
subsidiaries, American Reliable Insurance Company
(“ARIC”), participated in certain excess of loss
reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result,
reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance
risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a
portion of these risks to other reinsurers (retrocessionaires).
ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain
risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance
contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers
involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties
on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and
non-disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries
involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the
retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with
ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking
collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The
disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and
allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated
claims “spirals” devised to disproportionately pass
claims losses to higher-level reinsurance layers. Many of the
companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are
currently involved in negotiations, arbitration and/or
litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires,
reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including
brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those
disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those
involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss
accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program
year were adequate. However, the Company’s exposure under
the 1995 program year was less significant than the exposure
remaining under the 1996 and 1997 program years. The Company
believes, based on information currently available, that the
amounts accrued for currently outstanding disputes are adequate.
This loss accrual is management’s best estimate. However,
the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including
the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements the
Company may enter into in the future would be on favorable
terms, makes it difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty.
