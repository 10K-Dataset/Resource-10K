PART I

Item 1.

Business

Assurant, Inc. (Assurant) is a Delaware corporation, formed in
connection with the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) of
its Common Stock, which began trading on the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) on February 5, 2004. Prior to
that initial trading date, Fortis, Inc., a Nevada corporation,
had formed Assurant and merged into it on February 4, 2004.
The merger was executed in order to redomesticate Fortis, Inc.
from Nevada to Delaware and to change its name. As a result of
the merger, Assurant is the successor to the business operations
and obligations of Fortis, Inc.

Prior to the IPO, 100% of the outstanding common stock of
Fortis, Inc. was owned indirectly by Fortis N.V., a public
company with limited liability incorporated as naamloze
vennootschap under Dutch law, and Fortis SA/ NV, a public
company with limited liability incorporated as société
anonyme/naamloze vennootschap under Belgian law. Following the
IPO, Fortis N.V. and Fortis SA/ NV, through a wholly owned
subsidiary Fortis Insurance N.V., owned approximately 35%
(50,199,130 shares) of the outstanding common stock of
Assurant.

On January 21, 2005, Fortis N.V. and Fortis SA/ NV, through
a wholly owned subsidiary Fortis Insurance N.V. owned
approximately 36% (50,199,130 shares) of the outstanding
common stock of Assurant based on the number of shares
outstanding that day and sold 27,200,000 of those shares in a
secondary offering to the public. Assurant did not receive any
of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock. Fortis
N.V. received all net proceeds from the sale and concurrently
sold exchangeable bonds, due January 26, 2008, that are
mandatorily exchangeable for their remaining
22,999,130 shares of Assurant. The exchangeable bonds and
the shares of Assurant’s common stock into which they are
exchangeable have not been and will not be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and may not
be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or
an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

In this report, references to the “Company,”
“Assurant,” “we,” “us” or
“our” refer to (1) Fortis, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, and (2) Assurant, Inc. and its subsidiaries
after the consummation of the merger described above. References
to “Fortis” refer collectively to Fortis N.V. and
Fortis SA/ NV. References to our “separation” from
Fortis refer to the fact that Fortis reduced its ownership of
our common stock in connection with the secondary offering.

Overview

We pursue a differentiated strategy of building leading
positions in specialized market segments for insurance products
and related services in North America and selected international
markets. We provide creditor-placed homeowners insurance,
manufactured housing homeowners insurance, debt protection
administration, credit insurance, warranties and extended
service contracts, individual health and small employer group
health insurance, group dental insurance, group disability
insurance, group life insurance and pre-funded funeral insurance.

The markets we target are generally complex, have a relatively
limited number of competitors and, we believe, offer attractive
profit opportunities. In these markets, we leverage the
experience of our management team and apply our expertise in
risk management, underwriting and business-to-business
management, as well as our technological capabilities in complex
administration and systems. Through these activities, we seek to
generate above-average returns by building on specialized market
knowledge, well-established distribution relationships and
economies of scale.

As a result of our strategy, we are a leader in many of our
chosen markets and products. In our Assurant Solutions business,
we have leadership positions or are aligned with clients who are
leaders in creditor-placed homeowners insurance based on
servicing volume, manufactured housing homeowners insurance
based on number of homes built and debt protection
administration based on credit card balances outstanding. In our
Assurant Health business we were among one of the first
companies to offer Medical Savings Accounts (“MSA”)
and Health Savings Accounts (“HSA”). In our Assurant
Employee Benefits business, we are a



leading writer of group dental plans sponsored by employers
based on the number of subscribers and based on the number of
master contracts in force. A master contract refers to a single
contract issued to an employer that provides coverage on a group
basis; group members receive certificates, which summarize
benefits provided and serve as evidence of membership. In our
Assurant PreNeed business, we are the largest writer of
pre-funded funeral insurance measured by face amount of new
policies sold. We believe that our leadership positions give us
a sustainable competitive advantage in our chosen markets.

We currently have four decentralized operating business segments
to ensure focus on critical activities close to our target
markets and customers, while simultaneously providing
centralized support in key functions. Each operating business
segment has its own experienced management team with the
autonomy to make decisions on key operating matters. These
managers are eligible to receive incentive-based compensation
based in part on operating business segment performance and in
part on company-wide performance, thereby encouraging strong
business performance and cooperation across all our businesses.
At the operating business segment level, we stress disciplined
underwriting, careful analysis and constant improvement and
product redesign. At the corporate level, we provide support
services, including investment, asset/liability matching and
capital management, leadership development, information
technology support and other administrative and finance
functions, enabling the operating business segments to focus on
their target markets and distribution relationships while
enjoying the economies of scale realized by operating these
businesses together. Also, our overall strategy and financial
objectives are set and continuously monitored at the corporate
level to ensure that our capital resources are being properly
allocated.

We organize and manage our specialized businesses through four
operating business segments:



(1)

DRMS refers to Disability Reinsurance Management Services, Inc.,
    one of our wholly owned subsidiaries that provides a turnkey
    facility to other insurers to write principally group disability
    insurance.

We also have a Corporate and Other segment, which includes
activities of the holding company, financing expenses, net
realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income earned
from short-term investments held and, prior to 2004, interest
income from excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not
allocated to other segments. The Corporate and Other segment
also includes the amortization of deferred gains associated with
the portions of the sales of Fortis Financial Group
(“FFG”) and Long Term Care (“LTC”) sold
through reinsurance agreements. See
“Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Corporate and Other.”

Recent Accomplishments

Our business has exhibited strong performance in 2004, which we
believe demonstrates the strength of our diversified specialty
insurance operating model. We generated higher net income in
2004 than during the comparable period in 2003 and our
stockholders’ equity increased by 8% from December 31,
2003 through December 31, 2004 (pro forma to include in the
December 31, 2003 stockholders’ equity the
$725.5 million capital contribution we received from Fortis
in February 2004 in conjunction with our IPO). For the year
ended December 31, 2004, we generated total revenues of
$7,404 million and net income of $351 million. This
was achieved in a period of unprecedented hurricane activity
where we incurred substantial claims associated with these
storms.

We continued to focus on deploying our capital in an efficient
manner. Using cash flow generated from operations as well as
capital released as a result of our ongoing effort to
consolidate legal entities, we returned capital to our
stockholders through both quarterly cash dividends of
$0.07 per share and the repurchase of 2.4 million
outstanding shares of common stock through December 31,
2004.

We also executed on our strategy of strengthening our existing
distribution relationships and adding new partners. For example,
we renewed our exclusive health insurance distribution agreement
with State Farm,



and expanded our agreement with General Electric signed in 2003
to provide extended service contracts on home appliances.

Our operating segments continue to build their positions in
their specialty market niches. In Assurant Solutions, we have
seen top-line growth in specialty property, resulting in
improved operating results due to improved loss experience when
hurricane losses are excluded. Our consumer protection revenues
have also grown. Extended service contract revenues in both
domestic and international markets as well as international
credit insurance revenues have grown as well. This growth has
helped to offset the continued run-off of our U.S. credit
insurance business. In Assurant Health, individual medical
insurance premiums have grown significantly in 2004. Our
underwriting strength and pricing discipline, combined with
favorable claims development, drove combined ratios in Assurant
Health to historical lows in 2004. Additionally, we have seen an
increasing percentage of our individual health insurance sales
sold in conjunction with HSAs. In Assurant Employee Benefits, we
have continued to focus on the attractive employee-paid, or
voluntary, market segment. In Assurant PreNeed, we instituted
several expense management initiatives to help offset the
negative impact of continued low interest rates.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, Assurant Solutions
generated total revenues of $2,770 million, versus
$2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Assurant Health generated $2,338 million of total revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2004, versus
$2,091 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Assurant Employee Benefits generated $1,456 million of
total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, versus
$1,450 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Assurant PreNeed generated $739 million in total revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2004, versus
$723 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Competitive Strengths

We believe our competitive strengths include:

Leadership Positions in Specialized Markets.

We are a
market leader in many of our chosen markets. We hold a leading
position or are aligned with clients who are leaders in
creditor-placed homeowners insurance based on servicing volume,
manufactured housing homeowners insurance based on number of
homes built and credit insurance and debt protection
administration based on credit card balances outstanding. In
addition, we are market leaders in group dental plans sponsored
by employers based on the number of subscribers and based on the
number of master contracts in force, as well as a market leader
in pre-funded funeral insurance based on face amount of new
policies sold. We seek to participate in markets in which there
are a limited number of competitors and that allow us to achieve
a market leading position by capitalizing on our market
expertise and capabilities in complex administration and
systems, as well as on our established distribution
relationships. We believe that our leadership positions provide
us with the opportunity to generate high returns in these niche
markets.

Strong Relationships with Key Clients and Distributors.

As a result of our expertise in business-to-business management,
we have created strong relationships with our distributors and
clients in each of the niche markets we serve. In our Assurant
Solutions segment, we have strong long-term relationships in the
United States with six out of the ten largest mortgage lenders
and servicers based on servicing volume, three out of the six
largest manufactured housing builders based on number of homes
built, eight out of the ten



largest general purpose credit card issuers based on credit card
balances outstanding, and five out of the ten largest consumer
electronics and appliances retailers based on combined product
sales. Assurant Solutions’ relationships with these
distributors and clients average more than ten years. In our
Assurant Health segment, we have exclusive distribution
relationships with leading insurance companies based on total
assets, as well as relationships with independent brokers.
Through exclusive distribution relationships with companies such
as Insurance Placement Service, Inc. (“IPSI”), a
wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm, and United Services
Automobile Association (“USAA”), we gain access to a
broad distribution network and a significant number of potential
customers. In our Assurant PreNeed segment, we distribute our
pre-funded funeral insurance products through two distribution
channels: the independent channel, which distributes through
approximately 2,000 funeral homes and selected third-party
general agencies, and our American Memorial Life Insurance
Company (“AMLIC”) channel, which distributes through
an exclusive relationship with SCI in North America. Our
policies are sold by licensed insurance agents or enrollers who
in some cases may also be a funeral director. We believe that
the strength of our distribution relationships enables us to
market our products and services to our customers in an
effective and efficient manner that would be difficult for our
competitors to replicate.

History of Product Innovation and Ability to Adapt to
Changing Market Conditions.

We are able to adapt quickly to
changing market conditions by tailoring our product and service
offerings to the specific needs of our clients. This flexibility
has developed, in part, as a result of our entrepreneurial focus
and the encouragement of management autonomy at each business
segment. By understanding the dynamics of our core markets, we
design innovative products and services to seek to sustain
profitable growth and market leading positions. For instance, we
believe we were one of the first providers of credit insurance
to migrate towards fee-based debt protection solutions for our
financial institution clients. This has allowed us to meet the
evolving needs of our clients. It also has allowed us to
continue generating profitable business despite a significant
regulatory change that permitted financial institutions to offer
debt protection products similar to credit insurance as part of
their basic loan agreements with customers without being subject
to insurance regulations. Other examples of our innovative
products include: warranty products in our property business
designed specifically for vertically integrated manufacturers of
manufactured homes; specialty products, such as short-term
health insurance, to address specific developments in the health
insurance market and HSA features in our individual health
products, which we were one of the first companies to offer. In
addition, we developed our creditor-placed homeowners insurance
business when we identified a niche market opportunity.

Disciplined Approach to Underwriting and Risk Management.

Our businesses share best practices of disciplined underwriting
and risk management. We focus on generating profitability
through careful analysis of risks and draw on our experience in
core specialized markets. Examples of tools we use to manage our
risk include our tele-underwriting program, which enables our
trained underwriters to interview individual health insurance
applicants over the telephone, as well as our electronic billing
service in Assurant Employee Benefits, which enables us to
collect more accurate data regarding eligibility of insureds.
Also, at Assurant Solutions, in order to align our clients’
interests with ours and to help us to better manage risk
exposure, a significant portion of Assurant Solutions’
consumer protection solutions contracts are written on a
retrospective commission basis, which permits Assurant Solutions
to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Under this
commission arrangement, as permitted by law, compensation to the
financial institutions and other agents distributing our
products is predicated upon the actual losses incurred compared
to premiums earned after a specific net allowance to Assurant
Solutions. We also continually seek to improve and redesign our
product offerings based on our underwriting experience. In
addition, we closely monitor regulatory and market developments
and adapt our approach as we deem necessary to achieve our
underwriting and risk management goals. In Assurant Health, for
example, we have exited states in which we were not achieving
acceptable profitability and have re-entered states where the
insurance environments have become more favorable. We are
focused on loss containment, and we purchase reinsurance as a
risk management tool to diversify risk and protect against
unexpected events, such as catastrophes. We believe that our
disciplined underwriting and risk management philosophy have
enabled us to realize above average financial returns while
focusing on our strategic objectives.



Prudent Capital Management.

We focus on generating
above-average returns on a risk-adjusted basis from our
operating activities. We invest capital in our operating
business segments when we identify attractive profit
opportunities in our target markets. To the extent that we
believe we can achieve, maintain or improve on leadership
positions in these markets by deploying our capital and
leveraging our expertise and other competitive advantages, we
have done so with the expectation of generating high returns.
When expected returns have justified continued investment, we
have reinvested cash from operations into enhancing and growing
our operating business segments through the development of new
products and services, additional distribution relationships and
other operational improvements. In addition, when we have
identified external opportunities that are consistent with these
objectives, we have acquired businesses, portfolios,
distribution relationships, personnel or other resources. For
example, we acquired Protective Life Corporation’s Dental
Benefits Division (“DBD”) in December 2001. Finally,
our management has consistently taken a disciplined approach
towards withdrawing capital when businesses are no longer
anticipated to meet our expectations. For example, we have
exited or divested a number of operations including our LTC
division, which was sold to John Hancock in 2000 and our FFG
division, which was sold to The Hartford Financial Service Group
Inc. (“The Hartford”) in 2001. We believe we have
benefited from having the discipline and flexibility to deploy
capital opportunistically and prudently to maximize returns to
our stockholders.

Diverse Business Mix and Excellent Financial Strength.

We
have four operating business segments across distinct areas of
the insurance market. These businesses are generally not
affected in the same way by economic and operating trends, which
we believe allows us to maintain a greater level of financial
stability than many of our competitors across business and
economic cycles. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, we
had $24,504 million of total assets, including separate
accounts, and $3,635 million of stockholders’ equity.
Our domestic rated operating insurance subsidiaries have
financial strength ratings of A (“Excellent”) or A-
(“Excellent”) from A.M. Best, six of our domestic
operating insurance subsidiaries have financial strength ratings
of A2 (“Good”) or A3 (“Good”) from
Moody’s and seven of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries have financial strength ratings of A
(“Strong”) or A- (“Strong”) from Standard
and Poors (“S&P”). We employ a conservative
investment policy and our portfolio primarily consists of high
grade fixed income securities. As of December 31, 2004, we
had $12,148 million of investments, consisting primarily of
investment grade bonds with an average rating of “A”.
We believe our solid capital base and overall financial strength
allow us to distinguish ourselves from our competitors and
continue to enable us to attract clients that are seeking
long-term financial stability.

Experienced Management Team with Proven Track Record and
Entrepreneurial Culture.

We have a talented and experienced
management team both at the corporate level and at each of our
business segments.

Our management team is led by our President and Chief Executive
Officer, J. Kerry Clayton, who has been with our Company or its
predecessors for 34 years. Our senior officers have an
average tenure of approximately 21 years with our Company
and close to 26 years in the insurance and related risk
management business. Our management team has successfully
managed our business and executed on our specialized niche
strategy through numerous business cycles and political and
regulatory challenges. Our management team also shares a set of
corporate values and promotes a common corporate culture that we
believe enables us to leverage business ideas, risk management
expertise and focus on regulatory compliance across our
businesses. At the same time, we reward and encourage
entrepreneurship at each business segment, accomplished in part
by our long history of utilizing performance-based compensation
systems.

Growth Strategy

Our objective is to achieve superior financial performance by
enhancing our leading positions in our specialized niche
insurance and related businesses. We intend to achieve this
objective by continuing to execute the following strategies in
pursuit of profitable growth:

•

Enhance Market Position in Our Business Lines;

•

Develop New Distribution Channels and Strategic Alliances;



•

Deploy Capital and Resources to Maintain Flexibility and
    Establish or Enhance Market Leading Positions;

•

Maintain Disciplined Pricing Approach; and

•

Continue to Manage Capital Prudently.

Enhance Market Position in Our Business Lines.

We have
leading market positions in several of our business lines. We
have been selective in developing our product and service
offerings and will continue to focus on providing products and
services to those markets that we believe offer attractive
growth opportunities. We will also seek to continue penetrating
our target markets and expand our market positions by developing
and introducing new products and services that are tailored to
the specific needs of our clients. For example, we are
developing products that are targeted to purchasers of
recreational vehicles, cell phones and other consumer products.
In addition, we will continue to market our products to our
existing client base and seek to identify clients in new target
markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Germany and other
countries with emerging middle class populations.

Develop New Distribution Channels and Strategic
Alliances.

We have a strong, multi-channel distribution
network already in place with leading market participants. These
relationships have been critical to our market penetration and
growth. We will continue to be selective in developing new
distribution channels as we seek to expand our market share,
enter new geographic markets and develop new niche businesses.
For example, we have entered into a strategic alliance with GE
Consumer Products, which has enabled us to sell and administer
extended service contracts for consumer electronics, major
appliances and other consumer goods to General Electric’s
customers.

Deploy Capital and Resources to Maintain Flexibility and
Establish or Enhance Market Leading Positions.

We seek to
deploy our capital and resources in a manner that provides us
with the flexibility to grow internally through product
development, new distribution relationships and investments in
technology, as well as to pursue acquisitions. As we expand
through internal growth and acquisitions, we intend to leverage
our expertise in risk management, underwriting and
business-to-business management, as well as our technological
capabilities in running complex administration systems and
support services.

Maintain Disciplined Pricing Approach.

We intend to
maintain our disciplined pricing approach by seeking to focus on
profitable products and markets and by pursuing a flexible
approach to product design. We continuously evaluate the
profitability of our products, and we will continue to pursue
pricing strategies and adjust our mix of businesses by geography
and by product so that we can maintain attractive pricing and
margins. We seek to price our products at levels in order to
achieve our target profit objectives.

Continue to Manage Capital Prudently.

We intend to manage
our capital prudently relative to our risk exposure to maximize
profitability and long-term growth in stockholder value. Our
capital management strategy is to maintain financial strength
through conservative and disciplined risk management practices.
We do this through product design, strong underwriting and risk
selection and prudent claims management and pricing. In
addition, we will maintain our conservative investment portfolio
management philosophy and properly manage our invested assets in
order to match the duration of our insurance product
liabilities. We will continue to manage our business segments
with the appropriate level of capital required to obtain the
ratings necessary to operate in their markets and to satisfy
various regulatory requirements. We will also continue to
evaluate ways to reduce costs in each of our business lines,
including by streamlining the number of legal entities through
which we operate.

Operating Business Segments

Our business is comprised of four operating business segments:
Assurant Solutions; Assurant Health; Assurant Employee Benefits;
and Assurant PreNeed. We also have a Corporate and Other
segment. Our



business segments and the related net earned premiums and other

Assurant Solutions

Assurant Solutions, which we began operating with the
acquisition of American Security Group in 1980, has leadership
positions or is aligned with clients who are leaders in
creditor-placed homeowners insurance and related mortgage
tracking services based on servicing volume, manufactured
housing homeowners insurance based on number of homes built and
debt protection administration based on credit card balances
outstanding. We develop, underwrite and market our specialty
insurance products and services through collaborative
relationships with our clients (financial institutions, mortgage
lenders and servicers, retailers, manufactured housing and
automobile dealers, utilities and other entities) to their
customers. We serve our clients throughout North America, the
Caribbean and selected countries in South America and Europe.

Our principal business lines within our Assurant Solutions
segment have experienced growth in varying degrees. Growth in
premiums in the homeowners market has been driven by increased
home purchase activity



due to the low interest rate environment, appreciation in home
values, an increasing percentage of the population purchasing
homes and mortgage industry consolidation. We have also
experienced growth in our extended service contract and
international businesses due to the acquisition of new clients
as well as the expansion of our relationships with our existing
clients. The manufactured housing market has been more
challenging because of a more restrictive lending environment
with fewer lenders extending credit and increasingly strict
underwriting standards being applied since the late 1990’s.
Finally, the domestic consumer credit insurance market has been
contracting due to an adverse regulatory environment; however,
this decline has been offset somewhat by growth in the debt
protection market. This adverse regulatory environment has
included, in the last few years, many state regulatory
interpretations that impose rigorous agent licensing
requirements for employees of lenders who offer credit insurance
products as well as federal legislation which dissuades, and
various state laws that either dissuade or prohibit, financial
institutions from financing single premium credit or other
credit insurance on consumer or home loans secured by real
estate.

In Assurant Solutions, we provide specialty property and
consumer protection products and services. In our specialty
property solutions division, our strategy is to further develop
our creditor-placed homeowners and manufactured housing
homeowners insurance products and related services in order to
maintain our leadership position or relationships with clients
who are leaders and to gain market share in the mortgage and
manufactured housing industries, as well as to develop our
renters’ insurance product line. Renters’ insurance
generally provides coverage for the contents of a renter’s
home or apartment and for liability. In our consumer protection
solutions division, we intend to continue to focus on being a
low-cost provider of debt protection administration services, to
leverage our administrative infrastructure with our large
customer base clients and to manage the switch from credit
insurance programs to debt protection programs in the United
States. In addition, our consumer protection solutions division
offers a variety of warranties and extended service contracts on
consumer electronics, personal computers, appliances and
vehicles.

Specialty Property Solutions.

We underwrite a variety of

property coverages on manufactured housing, specialty
automobiles, including antique automobiles, recreational
vehicles, including motorcycles and watercraft, and leased and
financed equipment. We also offer complementary programs such as
flood insurance, renters’ insurance and various other
property coverages. We are a leading provider of creditor-placed
and other collateral protection insurance programs based on
number of loans serviced. These other collateral protection
insurance programs may include those that protect a
lender’s interest in homes, manufactured homes and
automobiles. We also offer administration services for some of
the largest mortgage lenders and servicers, manufactured housing
lenders, dealers and vertically integrated builders and
equipment leasing institutions in the United States. Many of our
products and services are sold in conjunction with the sale or
lease of the underlying property, vehicle or equipment by our
clients. Our market strategy is to establish relationships with
institutions who are leaders in their chosen



markets and therefore can effectively and efficiently distribute
our products and services to large customer bases.

The homeowners insurance product line is our largest line in the
specialty property solutions division and accounted for
approximately 17.1% of Assurant Solutions’ net earned
premiums and other considerations for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The primary program within this line is
our creditor-placed homeowners insurance. Creditor-placed
homeowners insurance generally consists of fire and dwelling
insurance that we provide to ensure collateral protection to a
mortgage lender in the event that a homeowner fails to purchase
or renew homeowners insurance on a mortgaged dwelling. In our
typical arrangements with our mortgage lender and servicer
clients, we agree that we will monitor the client’s
mortgage loan portfolio over time to verify the existence of
homeowners insurance protecting the lender’s interest in
the underlying properties. We have developed a proprietary
insurance tracking and administration process to verify the
existence of insurance on a mortgaged property. In situations
where such mortgaged property does not have appropriate
insurance and after notification to the mortgage holder of the
failure to have such insurance, we issue creditor-placed
insurance policies to ensure the mortgaged property is protected.

We also provide fee-based services to our mortgage lender and
servicer clients in the creditor-placed homeowners insurance
administration area, which services are complementary to our
insurance products. Our ability to offer these services is a
critical factor in establishing relationships with our clients.
The vast majority of our mortgage lender and servicer clients
outsource their insurance processing to us. These fee-based
services include receipt of the insurance-related mail, matching
of insurance information to specific loans, payment of insurance
premiums on escrowed accounts, insurance-related customer
service, loss draft administration and other related services.
Loss drafts refers to the payment of insurance proceeds for a
claim resulting from a loss to insured mortgage property.

The second largest specialty property line in the specialty
property solutions division is homeowners insurance for owners
of manufactured homes, which accounted for approximately 8.6% of
Assurant Solutions’ net earned premiums and other
considerations for the year ended December 31, 2004. We
primarily distribute our manufactured housing insurance programs
utilizing three marketing channels. Our primary channel is the
nation’s leading manufactured housing retailers based on
number of homes built. Through our proprietary premium rating
technology, which is integrated with our clients’ sales
process, we are able to offer our property coverages at the time
the home is being sold, thus enhancing our ability to penetrate
the new home point-of-sale market place. We also offer our
programs to independent specialty agents who distribute our
products to individuals subsequent to new home purchases.
Finally, we perform the collateral tracking, homeowners
insurance placement and administration services for these
leading manufactured housing lending organizations. Through
these collaborative relationships, we place our homeowners
coverage on the manufactured home in the event that the
homeowner fails to obtain or renew homeowners coverage on the
home. In a typical arrangement with a manufactured housing
lending organization, we agree to monitor the
organization’s portfolio of loans over time to verify the
existence of homeowners insurance protecting the
organization’s interest in the underlying manufactured
homes.

We also provide voluntary homeowners insurance and voluntary
manufactured housing homeowners insurance, which generally
provide comprehensive coverage for the structure, contents and
liability, as well as coverage for floods.

Consumer Protection Solutions.

We offer a broad array of
credit insurance programs, debt protection services and product
warranties and extended service contracts, all of which are
consumer-related, both domestically and in selected
international markets. Consumer protection products and services
accounted for approximately 68.6% of Assurant Solutions’
net earned premiums and other considerations for the year ended
December 31, 2004. Credit insurance and debt protection
programs generally offer a consumer a convenient option to
protect a credit card or installment loan in the event of a
disability, unemployment or death so that the amount of coverage
purchased equals the amount of outstanding debt. Under the
credit insurance program, the loan or credit card balance is
paid off in the case of death and, in the case of unemployment
or disability, payments are made on a loan until the covered
holder is employed again or medically able to return to work.
Under the terms and conditions of a debt protection agreement,
the monthly interest due from a



customer may be waived or the monthly payments may be paid for a
covered life event, such as disability, unemployment or family
leave. Most often in the case of the death of a covered account
holder, the debt is extinguished under the debt protection
program. Coverage is generally available to all consumers
without the underwriting restrictions that apply to term life
insurance. Term life insurance is life insurance written for a
specified period and under which no cash value is generally
available on surrender, such as medical examinations and medical
history reports. We are the exclusive provider of debt
protection administration services and credit insurance for
eight of the ten largest general purpose credit card issuers
based on credit card balances outstanding.

Almost all of the largest credit card issuing institutions in
the United States have switched from offering credit insurance
to their credit card customers to offering their own
banking-approved debt protection programs. Assurant Solutions
has been able to maintain all of its major credit card clients
as they switched from our credit insurance programs to their
debt protection programs. We earn fee income rather than net
earned premiums from our debt protection administration
services. In addition, margins are lower in debt protection
administration than in traditional credit insurance programs.
However, because debt protection is not an insurance product,
certain costs, such as regulatory costs and costs of capital,
are expected to be eliminated as the transition from credit
insurance to debt protection administration services continues.
The fees from debt protection administration do not fully
compensate for the decrease in credit insurance premiums. In
addition, we continue to provide credit insurance programs for
many leading retailers, consumer finance companies and other
institutions who are involved in consumer lending transactions.
For the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2003, our net earned premiums in the
U.S. credit insurance business decreased by approximately
$56.7 million while debt protection fee income increased by
$5.1 million. However, the decrease in credit insurance net
earned premiums is not analogous to the increase in debt
protection fee income because in the credit insurance business
we bear insurance risk and pay claims, whereas in the debt
protection business we bear no insurance risk and we collect
fees for the administrative services we render.

We also underwrite, and provide administration services on,
warranties and extended service contracts on appliances,
consumer electronics, including personal computers, cellular
phones and other wireless devices, and vehicles, including
automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats. Our strategy is to
provide our clients with all aspects of the warranty or extended
service contract, including: program design, marketing strategy,
technologically advanced administration, claims handling and
customer service. We believe that we maintain a differentiated
position in the marketplace as a provider of both the required
administrative infrastructure and insurance underwriting
capabilities.

On September 26, 2003, Assurant Solutions entered into an
agreement with General Electric to become the obligor and
insurer of all extended service contracts issued directly by
entities of GE Consumer Products and their clients. In addition,
Assurant Solutions has become the administrator of service
contracts covering personal computer products as well as a
variety of lawn and garden products.

Marketing and Distribution

Assurant Solutions markets its insurance programs and
administration services directly to large financial
institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, credit card
issuers, finance companies, automobile retailers, consumer
electronics retailers, manufactured housing lenders, dealers and
vertically integrated builders and other institutions.

Assurant Solutions enters into exclusive and other distribution
agreements, typically with terms of one to five years, and
develops interdependent systems with its clients that permit
Assurant Solutions’ information systems to interface with
its clients’ systems in order to exchange information in a
seamless and integrated manner. Through its long-standing
relationships, Assurant Solutions has access to numerous
potential policyholders and, in collaboration with its clients
can tailor its products to suit various market segments.
Assurant Solutions maintains a dedicated sales force that
establishes and maintains relationships with its clients.
Assurant Solutions has a multiple step business development
process that is employed by its direct sales force. This
multiple step business development process is a sales
methodology for contacting, negotiating



and consummating business relationships with new clients and
enhancing business relationships with existing clients. Assurant
Solutions maintains a specialized consumer acquisition marketing
services group that manages its direct marketing efforts on
behalf of its clients.

In the United States, we have strong distribution relationships
with six out of the ten largest mortgage lenders and servicers
based on servicing volume, four out of the seven largest
manufactured housing builders based on number of homes built,
eight out of the ten largest general purpose credit card issuers
based on credit card balances outstanding and five out of the
ten largest consumer electronics and appliances retailers based
on combined product sales, with an average relationship of at
least ten years.

Underwriting and Risk Management

We, along with Assurant Solutions’ predecessors, have over
50 years of experience in providing specialty insurance
programs and therefore maintain extensive proprietary actuarial
databases and catastrophe models. We believe these databases and
catastrophe models enable us to better identify and quantify the
expected loss experience of particular products and are employed
in the design of our products and the establishment of rates.

We have a disciplined approach to the management of our property
product lines. We monitor pricing adequacy on a product by
region, state, risk and producer. Subject to regulatory
considerations, we seek to make timely commission, premium and
coverage modifications where we determine them to be
appropriate. In addition, we maintain a segregated risk
management area for property exposures whose emphasis includes
catastrophic exposure management, reinsurance purchasing and
analytical review of profitability based on various catastrophe
models. We do not underwrite in our creditor-placed homeowners
insurance line, as our contracts with our clients require that
we automatically issue these policies, after notice, when a
policyholder’s homeowners policy lapses or is terminated.

A distinct characteristic of our credit insurance programs is
that the majority of these products have relatively low
exposures. This is because policy size is equal to the size of
the installment loan or credit card balance. Thus, loss severity
for most of this business is low relative to other insurance
companies writing more traditional lines of insurance. For those
product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes (for
example, our homeowners policies), we monitor and manage our
aggregate risk exposure by geographic area and have entered into
reinsurance treaties to manage our exposure to these types of
events.

Also, a significant portion of Assurant Solutions’ consumer
protection solutions contracts are written on a retrospective
commission basis, which permits Assurant Solutions to adjust
commissions based on claims experience. Under this commission
arrangement, as permitted by law, compensation to the financial
institutions and other clients is predicated upon the actual
losses incurred compared to premiums earned after a specific net
allowance to Assurant Solutions, which we believe aligns our
clients’ interests with ours and helps us to better manage
risk exposure.

In Assurant Solutions, our claims processing is automated and
combines the efficiency of centralized claims handling, customer
service centers and the flexibility of field representatives.
This flexibility adds savings and efficiencies to the
claims-handling process. Our claims department also provides
automated feedback to help with risk assessment and pricing. In
our specialty property solutions division, we complement our
automated claims processing with field representatives who
manage the claims process on the ground where and when needed.

Assurant Health

Assurant Health, which we began operating in 1978, is a writer
of individual and short-term major medical health insurance. We
also provide small employer group health insurance to employer
groups primarily of two to 50 employees in size, and health
insurance plans to full-time college students. We serve more
than 1.1 million people throughout the United States. We
were one of the first companies to offer the MSA feature as
part of our individual health products and, due to the enactment
of the Medicare Prescription and Modernization Act (“The
Act”), effective January 1, 2004, we began to offer an
HSA feature instead of



the MSA feature. HSAs are tax-sheltered savings accounts
earmarked for medical expenses and are established in
conjunction with one of our qualified high deductible health
plans.

We expect growth in the health insurance market to be driven by
inflation and increases in the cost of providing medical care as
well as growth in demand for individual and small group medical
products. We generally expect medical cost inflation to be a
principal driver of growth in this market; however, reduced
funding of health insurance by employers and the increasing
attractiveness and flexibility of MSAs could create
opportunities for the individual medical insurance market to
expand. We believe that the number of persons covered by
individually purchased health insurance as well as the number of
small employer groups in the United States will increase
primarily as a result of the recently passed The Act, which
includes a provision for HSAs that we believe will increase
health insurance options available to consumers and make health
insurance more affordable.

At Assurant Health, we intend to continue to concentrate on
developing our product capabilities in the individual health
insurance market. From 2000 through 2004, we increased the
relative percentage of individual health insurance products to
our total health insurance products from approximately 30% of
premium dollars to approximately 55% of premium dollars. We have
a variety of distribution relationships focused on the
individual health insurance market. We seek to maintain the
lowest combined ratio of any of our major competitors serving
the health care financing needs of individuals, families and
small employer groups. We have made progress in achieving this
goal and believe we currently have one of the lowest combined
ratios in our industry based on the reported results of
publicly-traded managed care and health insurance companies as
of September 30, 2004.

The following table provides net earned premiums and other
considerations, fees and other income and other operating data
for Assurant Health for the periods and as of the dates
indicated:

(1)

The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net
    earned premiums and other considerations.

(2)

The expense ratio is equal to selling, underwriting and general
    expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations
    and fees and other income.

(3)

The combined ratio is equal to total benefits, losses and
    expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations
    and fees and other income.



Products and Services

Individual Health Insurance Products.

Assurant
Health’s individual health insurance products are sold to
individuals, primarily between the ages of 18 and 64 years,
and their families who do not have employer-sponsored coverage.
Due to increasingly stringent federal and state restrictions
relating to insurance policies sold directly to individuals, we
emphasize the sale of individual products through associations
and trusts that act as the master policyholder for such
products. Our association and trust products offer greater
flexibility in pricing, underwriting and product design compared
to products sold directly to individuals on a true individual
policy basis.

Substantially all of the individual health insurance products we
sell are PPO plans, which offer the member the ability to select
any health care provider, with benefits reimbursed at a higher
level when care is received from a participating network
provider. Coverage is typically subject to co-payments or
deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing for
covered services limited by lifetime policy maximums of
$2 million or $3 million, with options to purchase
between $6 million and $8 million. Product features
often included in these plans are inpatient pre-certification
and benefits for preventative services. These products are
individually underwritten taking into account the member’s
medical history and other factors, and consist primarily of
major medical insurance that renews on an annual basis. The
remaining products we sell are indemnity, or fee-for-service,
plans. Indemnity plans offer the member the ability to select
any health care provider for covered services.

At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we had
total in force medical policies of 322,300 and 306,400,
respectively, covering approximately 649,000 and 613,000
individuals, respectively. Approximately 21% of the members
covered by individual health insurance policies we sold in 2003
included an MSA and approximately 37% of the members covered by
individual health insurance policies we sold in the year ended
December 31, 2004 were sold in conjunction with an HSA.

Assurant Health markets additional products to the individual
market: short-term medical insurance and student health coverage
plans. The short-term medical insurance product is designed for
individuals who are between jobs or seeking interim coverage
before their major medical coverage becomes effective.
Short-term medical insurance products are generally sold to
individuals with gaps in coverage for six months or less.
Student health coverage plans are medical insurance plans sold
to full-time college students who are not covered by their
parents’ health insurance, are no longer eligible for
dependant coverage or are seeking a more comprehensive
alternative to a college-sponsored plan.

Small Employer Health Insurance Products.

Our small
employer market primarily includes companies with two to 50
employees, although larger employer coverage is available. Our
average group size, as of December 31, 2004, was
approximately five employees.

Substantially all of the small employer health insurance
products that we sold in 2004 and 2003 were PPO products. At
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we had total
in force medical certificates of 182,500 and 204,000,
respectively, covering approximately 333,000 and 376,000
individuals, respectively. The number of small employer groups
as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was
approximately 33,900 and 37,700, respectively.

We offer Health Reimbursement Accounts, which are
employer-funded accounts provided to employees for reimbursement
of qualifying medical expenses. We also offer certain ancillary
products to meet the demands of small employers for life
insurance, short-term disability insurance and dental insurance.
In addition, beginning in January 2004, we began offering HSA
products to individuals and small employer groups.

Marketing and Distribution

Our health insurance products are principally marketed to an
extensive network of independent agents by Assurant Health
distributors. Approximately 165,000 agents had access to
Assurant Health products during 2004. We also market our
products to individuals through a variety of exclusive and
non-exclusive national account relationships and direct
distribution channels. In addition, we market our products
through NorthStar



Marketing, a wholly owned affiliate that proactively seeks
business directly from independent agents. Since 2000, Assurant
Health has had an exclusive national marketing agreement with
IPSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm, pursuant to which
IPSI captive agents market Assurant Health’s individual
health products. Captive agents are representatives of a single
insurer or group of insurers who are obligated to submit
business only to that insurer, or at a minimum, give that
insurer first refusal rights on a sale. The term of this
agreement with IPSI will expire in June 2008, but may be
extended if agreed to by both parties. In addition, Assurant
Health has an exclusive distribution relationship with USAA to
market Assurant Health’s individual health products. The
agreement that provides for our arrangement with USAA terminates
in July 2005, but may be extended for a one-year period if
agreed to by both parties. All of these arrangements have
four-year terms from their commencement dates and are generally
terminable upon bankruptcy or similar proceeding or a breach of
a material provision by either party. Additionally, some of
these arrangements permit termination after a specified notice
period. We also have a solid relationship with Health Advocates
Alliance (“HAA”), the association through which we
provide many of our individual health insurance products through
Assurant Health’s agreement with HAA’s administrator
National Administration Company (“NAC”), Inc. The term
of this agreement with NAC will expire in September 2006, but
will be automatically extended for an additional two-year term
unless prior notice of a party’s intent to terminate is
given to the other party. Assurant Health also has had a
long-term relationship with Rogers Benefit Group, a national
marketing organization through which we offer our products
through 60 of their offices. Short-term medical insurance and
student health coverage plans are also sold through the Internet
by Assurant Health and numerous direct writing agents.

Underwriting and Risk Management

Assurant Health’s underwriting and risk management
capabilities include pricing discipline, policy underwriting,
renewal optimization, development and retention of provider
networks and claims processing.

In establishing premium rates for our health care plans, we use
underwriting criteria based upon our accumulated actuarial data,
with adjustments for factors such as claims experience and
member demographics to evaluate anticipated health care costs.
Our pricing considers the expected frequency and severity of
claims and the costs of providing the necessary coverage,
including the cost of administering policy benefits, sales and
other administrative costs. State rate regulation significantly
affects pricing. Our health insurance operations are subject to
a variety of legislative and regulatory requirements and
restrictions covering a range of trade and claim settlement
practices. State insurance regulatory authorities have broad
discretion in approving a health insurer’s proposed rates.
In addition, Health Insurance Protability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (“HIPAA”) requires certain guaranteed issuance
and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals
and small employer groups and limits exclusions based on
existing conditions.

In our individual health insurance business, we medically
underwrite our applicants and have implemented programs to
improve our underwriting process. These include our
tele-underwriting program, which enables individual insurance
applicants to be interviewed over the telephone by trained
underwriters. Gathering information directly from prospective
clients over the telephone greatly reduces the need for costly
and time-consuming medical exams and physician reports. We
believe this approach leads to lower costs, improved
productivity, faster application processing times and improved
underwriting information. Our individual underwriting considers
not only an applicant’s medical history, but also lifestyle
factors such as avocations and alcohol and drug and tobacco use.
Our individual health insurance products generally permit us to
rescind coverage if an insured has falsified his or her
application.

Assurant Health offers a broad choice of PPO network options in
each of its markets and enrolls members in the network that
Assurant Health believes reduces our price paid for health care
services while providing high quality care. Assurant Health
enrolls indemnity customers in selected PPO networks to obtain
discounts on provider services that would otherwise not be
available. In situations where a customer does not obtain
services from a contracted provider, Assurant Health applies
various usual and customary fees, which limit the amount paid to
providers within specific geographic areas.



Provider network contracts are a critical dimension in
controlling medical costs since there is often a significant
difference between a network negotiated rate and the
non-discounted rate. To this end, we retain provider networks
through a variety of relationships, which include leased
networks that contract directly with individual health care
providers, proprietary contracts and Private Health Care
Systems, Inc. (PHCS). PHCS is a national private company that
maintains a provider network, which consisted of approximately
4,200 hospitals and approximately 450,000 physicians as of
December 31, 2004. Assurant Health was a co-founder of
PHCS, and as of December 31, 2004 we owned approximately
38% of the company. PHCS has a staff solely dedicated to
provider relations.

We seek to manage claim costs in our PPO plans by selecting
provider networks that have negotiated favorable arrangements
with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals
and requiring participation in our various medical management
programs. In addition, we manage costs through extensive
underwriting, pricing and product design decisions intended to
influence the behavior of our insureds. We provide case
management programs and have doctors, nurses and pharmacists on
staff who endeavor to manage risks related to medical claims and
prescription costs.

We utilize a broad range of focused traditional cost containment
and care management processes across our various product lines
to manage risk and to lower costs. These include case
management, disease management and pharmacy benefits management
programs. Our case management philosophy is built on helping our
insureds confront a complex care system to find the appropriate
care in a timely and cost effective manner. We believe this
approach builds positive relationships with our providers and
insureds and helps us achieve cost savings.

Effective July 1, 2003, Assurant Health transitioned its
pharmacy benefits management function to Medco Health Solutions,
formerly known as Merck-Medco. Medco Health Solutions has
established itself as a leader in its industry with more than
60,000 participating pharmacies nationwide. Through Medco Health
Solutions’ advanced technology platforms, Assurant Health
is able to access information about customer utilization
patterns on a more timely basis to improve its risk management
capabilities. In addition to the technology-based advantages,
Medco Health Solutions allows us to purchase our pharmacy
benefits at competitive prices. Our agreement with Medco Health
Solutions expires June 30, 2007. Assurant Health also
utilizes co-payments and deductibles to reduce prescription drug
costs.

We employ approximately 525 claims employees in locations
throughout the United States dedicated to Assurant Health. We
have an appeals process pursuant to which policyholders can
appeal claims decisions made.

Assurant Employee Benefits

Assurant Employee Benefits, which we began operating with the
acquisition of Mutual Benefit Life Group Division (now Fortis
Benefits Insurance Company) in 1991, is a market leader in group
dental benefit plans sponsored by employers and funded through
payroll deductions based on the number of master contracts in
force. We are also a leading provider of disability and term
life insurance products and related services to small and
medium-sized employers based on number of master contracts in
force.

In our core benefits business, we focus on employer-sponsored
programs for employers with typically between 20 and 1,000
employees. We are willing to write programs for employers with
more than 1,000 covered employees when they meet our risk
profile. At December 31, 2004, substantially all of our
coverages in force and 77% of our annualized premiums in force
were for employers with less than 1,000 employees. We have a
particularly strong emphasis on employers with under 250
employees, which represented approximately 97% and 60% of our in
force coverages and premiums, respectively, as of
December 31, 2004. Our average in force case size was 58
enrolled employees as of December 31, 2004.

We believe that the small employer market is growing, and that
there is no dominant player in the small group market. We
believe that growth in our Assurant Employee Benefits segment
will be principally driven by increases in the numbers of
employees enrolled in our plans, inflation and increases in the
cost of providing dental care and, for our group disability and
term life business, increases in salaries. We believe that
increased



penetration of our target employer base could generate growth
for this segment. According to the 2004 National Compensation
Survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
U.S. Department of Labor, in March 2004, 40% of full-time
non-agricultural private industry employees lack employer
provided or sponsored life insurance coverage, 54% lack
short-term disability coverage, 64% lack long-term disability
coverage and 54% lack dental coverage. During 2003, according to
National Association of Dental Plans and Life Insurance
Marketing Research Association studies, approximately
$7.5 billion in annualized premiums of group dental,
disability and life insurance was sold in the United States.
Exclusive of group dental, for which historical data from these
sources is not available, the average annual growth rate in
sales of the remaining group products for 2000 through 2003 was
4.1% per year. We believe that our broad product and
distribution coverage and our expertise in small case
underwriting will position us favorably as these markets
continue to grow.

Trends in the U.S. employment market and, in particular, in
the cost of the medical benefits component of total
compensation, are leading an increasing number of employers to
offer new benefits on a voluntary basis. That is, after
originally vetting the insurer and typically selecting the
particular plan features to be offered, the employer offers the
new benefits to employees at their election and at their cost,
administered through payroll deduction. Because these products
can be economically distributed on this group basis and are
convenient to purchase and maintain, they are appealing to
employees who might have little opportunity or inclination to
purchase similar coverage on an individual basis.

We believe that voluntary products represent a sizeable growth
opportunity. Soliciting employees to enroll in
employer-sponsored health plans requires effective communication
and interaction with the target employee. We have reorganized
our home office and sales operations to reflect the strategic
importance of this area. As part of this reorganization, we have
divided our sales force into those who sell voluntary products
and those who sell “true group” products with each
division collaborating with the other to help meet the needs of
shared brokers and clients. True group products are group
insurance products in which the employer or other group
policyholder pays all or part of the premium on behalf of the
insured members. We are also investing resources in enhanced
enrollment and specialized administrative capabilities for the
voluntary market.

The following table provides net earned premiums and other
considerations, fees and other income and other operating data
for Assurant Employee Benefits for the periods and as of the
dates indicated:

(1)

The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net
    earned premiums and other considerations.



(2)

The expense ratio is equal to selling, underwriting and general
    expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations
    and fees and other income.

(3)

The premium persistency ratio is equal to the rate at which
    existing business for all issue years at the beginning of the
    period remains in force at the end of the period. The
    calculation for the year ended December 31, 2002 excludes
    the DBD of Protective Life Corporation.

Products and Services

Group Dental.

Dental benefit plans provide for the
funding of necessary or elective dental care. We provide both
employee-paid and employer-paid plans. Plans may involve a
traditional indemnity arrangement, a PPO arrangement, a
“prepaid” arrangement, or some combination of these
programs with employee choice. In a PPO plan, insureds may
select any dental provider, but benefits are reimbursed at a
higher level when they visit a provider who participates in the
PPO. Coverage is subject to deductibles, coinsurance and annual
or lifetime maximums. In a prepaid plan, members must go to
participating dentists in order to receive benefits. Depending
upon the procedure, dental benefits are provided by
participating dentists at either no cost or a nominal co-payment.

Success in the group dental business requires strong provider
network development and management skills, a focus on expense
management and a claim system capable of efficiently and
accurately adjudicating high volumes of transactions. We have
developed local managed care networks in 25 states.

In addition to fully insured dental benefits, we also offer
Administrative Services Only (“ASO”) for self-funded
dental plans. Under these arrangements, the employers or plan
sponsors pay Assurant Employee Benefits a fee for providing
these services. As of December 31, 2004, our block of this
business consisted of approximately 200 groups and approximately
83,000 covered employees and, for the year ended
December 31, 2004, generated $4.3 million of fee
revenue.

As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we had
approximately 25,100 and 29,300 group dental plans insured or
administered through this segment, respectively, covering or
involving approximately 1.3 million and 1.4 million
members, respectively.

Group Disability Insurance.

Group disability insurance
provides partial replacement of lost earnings for insured
employees who become disabled and otherwise qualify for
benefits. Our group disability products include both short-term
and long-term disability insurance. Group long-term disability
insurance provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of
income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or
injury. Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or
180 day waiting periods, and benefits are limited to
specified maximums as a percentage of income. Group short-term
disability insurance provides coverage for temporary loss of
income due to injury or sickness, often effective immediately
for accidents and after one week for sickness, also limited to
specified maximums as a percentage of income.

DRMS, our wholly owned subsidiary, provides insurance carriers
that wish to supplement their core product offerings a turnkey
facility with which to write group disability insurance.
Services we provide to the insurers for a fee include product
development, state insurance regulatory filings, underwriting,
claims management or any of the other functions typically
performed by an insurer’s back office. The risks written by
DRMS’ various clients are reinsured into a pool, with the
clients generally retaining shares ranging from 0% to 50% of the
risks they write. As the largest reinsurer in the pools, our
licensed insurance subsidiaries reinsure a substantial majority
of the insurance risk that is ceded by the client. Since DRMS
clients operate in niches not often reached through our
traditional distribution, our participation in the pools enables
us, through a form of alternate distribution, to reach customers
to whom we would not otherwise have access.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had approximately
37,300 and 37,500 group disability plans in force, reinsured or
administered on an ASO basis, covering approximately
2.8 million and 2.7 million enrolled employees,
respectively.

Group Term Life Insurance.

Group term life insurance is
one of the principal means by which working people in the United
States provide for their families against the risk of premature
death and often the means



whereby they obtain lesser amounts of coverage for their
spouses, children or domestic partners. Group term life
insurance consists primarily of renewable term life insurance,
which is term life coverage that is renewable at the option of
the insured who is not required to take a medical examination in
order to renew existing amounts of coverage, with the amount of
coverage as a flat amount, an amount linked to the
employees’ earnings, or a combination of the two. Employers
generally provide a base or foundation level of coverage for
their employees and offer the opportunity for employees to
increase their coverage to meet specific needs. Also, basic term
life insurance is often supplemented with an accidental death or
dismemberment policy or rider, which provides additional
benefits in the indicated events. Because there are few ways to
differentiate an insurer in the area of traditional group term
life insurance, we often sell this product line as a complement
to our other core employee benefit insurance products.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had approximately
25,300 and 25,200 group life plans in force, respectively,
covering approximately 1.7 million enrolled employees in
each year.

Marketing and Distribution

We distribute the products of Assurant Employee Benefits
primarily through approximately 173 group sales representatives,
located in 37 offices in or near major U.S. metropolitan
areas. These representatives work through independent employee
benefits advisors, including brokers and other intermediaries,
to reach our customers, who are primarily small to medium-sized
employers. DRMS employs an independent distribution arm tailored
to its needs. Our marketing efforts concentrate on the
identification of the employee benefit needs of our targeted
customers, the development of tailored products and services
designed to meet those needs, the alignment of our Company with
select brokers and other intermediaries who value our approach
to the market, and the promotion of our Company’s brand.

To compete effectively in the small to medium-sized employer
marketplace requires a large and broadly distributed sales force
with relationships with the brokers and other intermediaries who
act as advisors to those employers in connection with their
benefits programs. In many cases, these employers and their
advisors rely on us for expertise in matching their needs to the
collection of solutions available through group benefit
programs. Competing effectively also requires systems and work
practices suited to a high transaction volume business and the
ability to provide a high level of customer service to a large
number of clients operating in almost all industries found in
the U.S. economy.

Underwriting and Risk Management

True group products are normally offered to employees on a
guaranteed issue basis, meaning that if the group is an
acceptable risk, the insurer generally foregoes individual
medical underwriting and agrees in advance to accept all
applications for insurance from members of the eligible class up
to a formula-determined limit. Individual medical underwriting
is required on applications for amounts in excess of this limit,
or in connection with untimely applications. Our sales
representatives and underwriters evaluate the risk
characteristics of each prospective insured group and design
appropriate plans of insurance. They utilize various techniques
such as deductibles, co-payments, guarantee issue limits and
waiting periods to control the risk we assume. Voluntary
products introduce additional risks due to the fact that
employees have some awareness of the risk of loss they
personally face, and those employees who believe themselves to
be more at risk will be more likely to elect coverage. In order
to manage these risks, we customize our plan designs to seek to
mitigate adverse selection problems. We also require that a
minimum percentage of eligible employees elect a voluntary
coverage.

We base the pricing of our products on the expected pay-out of
benefits that we calculate using assumptions for mortality,
morbidity, interest, expenses and persistency, depending upon
the specific product features. Group underwriting takes into
account demographic factors such as age, gender and occupation
of members of the group as well as the geographic location and
concentration of the group. Our disability policies often limit
the payment of benefits for certain kinds of conditions, such as
pre-existing conditions or disabilities arising from
specifically listed medical conditions, in each case as defined
in the policies.



Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of
risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any
employer or intermediary. Requests for coverage are reviewed on
their merits and generally a policy is not issued unless the
particular risk or group has been examined and approved by our
underwriters. Group products are typically written with an
initial rate guarantee of two years for disability and life
insurance and one year for other group products. They are also
written on a guaranteed renewable basis, meaning that they are
renewable at the option of the policyholder for a specified
number of years, with the right, upon expiration of the
guarantee, to re-price to reflect the aggregate experience of
our block of business and, where credible, the experience of the
group. Credibility in this context means the assessment of the
likelihood that the past history of the group is predictive of
the future experience of the group. Credibility generally
increases with group size or with the quantity of claims filed.

The business underwritten by our Assurant Employee Benefits
segment is widely dispersed across geographic areas as well as
the industries insured. At December 31, 2004, our top ten
states measured by percentage of in force annual premiums
contributed approximately 54.6% of our total annualized premiums
in force, with our largest geographic area, California,
contributing 10.5%.

Similarly, at December 31, 2004, our top ten industry
segments measured by percentage of in force annual premiums, as
aggregated by the first two digits of their Standard Industry
Code (“SIC”), contributed approximately 49.8% of our
total annualized premiums in force, with the largest
contributor, health services, accounting for 9.1%.

Our efforts are focused on facilitating claimants’ return
to work through a variety of means, including physical therapy,
vocational rehabilitation and retraining and workplace
accommodation to assist the insured. In support of this effort,
we also employ or contract with a staff of doctors, nurses and
vocational rehabilitation specialists. We also utilize a broad
range of outside medical and vocational experts for independent
evaluations and local vocational services. Finally, we have an
investigations unit focused on individuals who have or may be
capable of returning to work but continue to claim benefits. Our
dental business utilizes a highly automated claims system
focused on rapid handling of claims, with 68% of claims
adjudicated within seven calendar days for claims received from
January 1, 2004 to and including December 31, 2004.

We employ approximately 630 claims employees in locations
throughout the United States dedicated to the Assurant Employee
Benefits segment. We have a claims review process, including an
appeals process pursuant to which policyholders can appeal
claims decisions made.

Assurant PreNeed

Assurant PreNeed, which we began operating with the acquisition
of United Family Life Insurance Company in 1980, is the market
leader in the United States in pre-funded funeral insurance
based on face amount of new policies sold. Pre-funded funeral
insurance provides whole life insurance death benefits or
annuity benefits used to fund costs incurred in connection with
pre-arranged funerals. An annuity is a contract that provides
for periodic payments to an annuitant for a specified period of
time. In the case of annuities sold by Assurant PreNeed, all the
benefits under the contract are generally paid out at the death
of the purchaser of the annuity. We distribute our pre-funded
funeral insurance products through two separate channels, our
independent channel and our AMLIC channel. Our pre-funded
funeral insurance products provide benefits to cover the costs
incurred in connection with pre-arranged funeral contracts and
are distributed primarily through funeral homes and sold mainly
to consumers over the age of 65, with an average issue age of
72. Our pre-funded funeral insurance products are typically
structured as whole life insurance policies in the United States
and as annuity products in Canada. Our independent
channel’s target market is comprised of the 23,000 funeral
firms in the United States and Canada, of which approximately
2,000 are active customers.

With our acquisition of AMLIC in 2000, we have become the market
leader in the area of pre-funded funeral insurance based on face
amount of policies sold. Through our AMLIC channel, we provide
the insurance products and support services for the pre-need
activities of SCI, the largest funeral provider in North America
based on total revenues. As of December 31, 2004, SCI
operated approximately 1,200 funeral service locations,
cemeteries and crematoria in North America. This
commission-based arrangement is anchored by an exclusive
ten-year marketing agreement, which commenced on October 1,
2000.



Growth in pre-need sales has been traditionally driven by
distribution with a high correlation between new sales of
pre-funded funeral insurance and the number of pre-need
counselors marketing the product and expansion in sales and
marketing capabilities. In addition, as alternative distribution
channels are identified, such as targeting affinity groups and
employers, we believe growth in this market could accelerate. We
believe that the pre-need market is characterized by an aging
population combined with low penetration of the over-65 market.

In Assurant PreNeed, our strategy in our independent channel is
to increase sales potential by strengthening our distribution
relationships. We offer marketing support and programs to our
funeral firm clients to increase their local market share,
providing training for their sales counselors and assisting them
in developing direct-to-consumer marketing programs and lead
generation and management tools. Through our AMLIC channel our
strategy is to reduce SCI’s cost to sell and manage its
pre-need operation. We integrate our processes for managing
SCI’s insurance production into its process for managing
its pre-need business. Additionally, in keeping with our goal of
aligning SCI’s interest with ours, our arrangement with SCI
is commission-based; however, we compensate SCI with an
escalating production-based commission, with a defined maximum.

The following table provides net earned premiums and other
considerations, fees and other income and other operating data
for Assurant PreNeed for the periods and as of the dates
indicated:

Products

Pre-Funded Funeral Insurance Policies.

Pre-funded funeral
insurance provides whole life insurance death benefits or
annuity benefits to fund the costs incurred in connection with
pre-arranged funeral contracts, or, in a minority of situations,
pre-arranged funerals without a pre-arranged funeral contract,
which costs typically include funeral firm merchandise and
services. Our pre-funded funeral insurance products are
typically structured as whole life insurance policies in the
United States. In Canada, our pre-funded funeral insurance
products are typically structured as annuity contracts for newly
issued business. A pre-arranged funeral contract is an
arrangement between a funeral firm and an individual whereby the
funeral firm agrees to perform the selected funeral upon the
individual’s death. The consumer then purchases an
insurance policy intended to cover the cost of the pre-arranged
funeral, and the funeral home generally becomes the irrevocable
assignee, or, in certain cases, the beneficiary, of the
insurance policy proceeds. However, the insured may name a
beneficiary other than the funeral home. The funeral home agrees
to provide the selected funeral at death in exchange for the
policy proceeds. Because the death benefit under many of our
policies is designed to grow over time, the funeral firm that is
the assignee of such a policy has managed some or all of its
funeral



inflation risk. Consumers have the choice of making their policy
payments as a single lump-sum payment or through multi-payment
plans that spread payments out over a period of three to ten
years. We do not provide any funeral goods and services in
connection with our pre-funded funeral insurance policies; these
policies pay death benefits in cash only.

Marketing and Distribution

We distribute our pre-funded funeral insurance products through
two distribution channels: the independent channel, which
distributes through approximately 2,000 funeral homes and
selected third-party general agencies, and our AMLIC channel,
which distributes through an exclusive relationship with SCI in
North America. Our policies are sold by licensed insurance
agents or enrollers who in some cases may also be a funeral
director. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the face amount
of our contracts sold through our AMLIC channel represented
approximately 49% and 50%, respectively, of our total new life
and annuity face sales in Assurant PreNeed.

Risk Management

Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life insurance policies
with increasing death benefits and obtains the majority of its
profits through interest rate spreads. Interest rate spreads
refer to the difference between the death benefit growth rates
on pre-funded funeral insurance policies and the investment
returns generated on the assets we hold related to those
policies. To manage these spreads, we monitor weekly the
movement in new money yields and monthly evaluate our actual net
new achievable yields. This information is used to evaluate
rates to be credited on applicable new and in force pre-funded
funeral insurance policies and annuities. In addition, we review
asset benchmarks and perform asset/liability matching studies to
develop the optimum portfolio to maximize yield and reduce risk.

In Assurant PreNeed, we utilize underwriting to select and price
insurance risks. We regularly monitor mortality assumptions to
determine if experience remains consistent with these
assumptions and to ensure that our product pricing remains
appropriate. We periodically review our underwriting, agent and
policy contract provisions and pricing guidelines so that our
policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing
strategies and profitability goals.

Many of our pre-funded whole-life funeral insurance policies
have increasing death benefits. As of December 31, 2004,
approximately 83% of Assurant PreNeed’s in force insurance
policy reserves relate to policies that provide for death
benefit growth, some of which provide for minimum death benefit
growth pegged to changes in the Consumer Price Index
(“CPI”). Policies that have rates guaranteed to change
with the CPI represented approximately 12% of Assurant
PreNeed’s reserves as of December 31, 2004. We have
employed risk mitigation strategies to seek to minimize our
exposure to a rapid increase in inflation.

In our independent channel, we outsource all of the servicing
and administration of our policies.

Ceded Reinsurance

Our operating business segments utilize ceded reinsurance for
three major business purposes:

•

Loss Protection and Capital Management.

As part of our
    overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase
    reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various
    operating business segments, including significant individual or
    catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to
    write additional business.

•

Business Dispositions.

We have used reinsurance to exit
    certain businesses, such as our FFG division in 2001 and our LTC
    business in 2000. Reinsurance was used in these cases to
    facilitate the transactions because the businesses shared legal
    entities with business segments that we retained.

•

Assurant Solutions’ Client Risk and Profit Sharing.

Assurant Solutions writes business produced by its clients, such
    as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial institutions,
    and reinsures all or a



portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of the
    clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in
    structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying
    business.

Loss Protection and Capital Management

In a traditional indemnity reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer
agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its
liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed
upon premium. These agreements provide for recovery of a portion
of losses and associated loss expenses from reinsurers. The
terms of these agreements, which are typical for agreements of
this type, generally provide, among other things, for the
automatic acceptance by the reinsurer of ceded risks in excess
of our retention limits (i.e. the amount of loss per individual
risk that we are willing to absorb). For excess of loss
coverage, we pay premiums to the reinsurers based on rates
negotiated and stated in the treaties. For pro rata reinsurance,
we pay premiums to the reinsurers based upon percentages of
premiums received by us on the business reinsured. These
agreements are generally terminable as to new risks by us or by
the reinsurer on appropriate notice; however, termination does
not affect risks ceded during the term of the agreement, which
generally remain with the reinsurer.

We work with our business segments to develop effective
reinsurance arrangements that are consistent with their pricing
and operational goals. For example, Assurant Employee Benefits
cedes 100% of monthly disability claims in excess of
$10,000 per individual insured. For our group term life
business, the maximum amount retained on any one life is
$800,000 of life insurance including accidental death, limited
to $500,000 in life insurance and $300,000 in accidental death
and dismemberment insurance. Amounts in excess of these figures
are reinsured with other life insurance companies on a yearly
renewable term basis. Assurant Solutions purchases property
reinsurance for flood risk, with per property limits of $925,000
in excess of $75,000 per individual loss. This treaty has a
per occurrence cap of $2,775,000.

For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes
(for example, homeowners’ policies written by Assurant
Solutions), we closely monitor and manage our aggregate risk
exposure by geographic area and have entered into reinsurance
treaties to manage our exposure to these types of events. For
2004, catastrophe reinsurance was purchased to manage our risk
exposure to a hurricane loss in excess of the modeled 300-year
return time loss. We maintain $160 million of catastrophic
excess of loss coverage for fire, flood and personal liability
risks, with a per occurrence retention of the first
$25 million. In addition, Florida hurricane losses are
covered by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF), with
coverage equal to 90% of $102.1 million in excess of
$27.5 million. This coverage has been in place as of
June 1, 2004 and will continue through May 31, 2005.
Future FHCF coverage will be determined by the FHCF in
accordance with Florida statutes and will depend upon Assurant
Solutions’ in force Florida risks and the FHCF claims
paying capacity. Also, in Assurant Employee Benefits, we have
purchased catastrophic reinsurance coverage in the group term
life product line of $40 million in excess of our retention
of the first $20 million.

Historically, a significant portion of Assurant Health’s
business has been reinsured under non-proportional reinsurance
agreements that provide for the reinsurers to indemnify us for
losses in a calendar year on combined ratios up to but not
exceeding 110%. We will not renew or replace this reinsurance
effective as of December 31, 2004. If our loss ratios in
this segment deteriorate beyond a certain level, we will not be
entitled to certain reinsurance recoverables to which we were
previously entitled.

With the exception of a small block of older policy forms, all
of the LTC business of John Alden, one of our subsidiaries, has
been reinsured with Employers Reassurance Corporation
(“ERC”), a subsidiary of General Electric. All risks
and profits generated by the reinsured business have been
transferred to ERC. The reserves and premium transferred are in
excess of 95% of the direct long-term care amounts generated by
John Alden. The remaining small block of long-term care policies
in John Alden has been reinsured with John Hancock as part of
the sale of that division. See “— Business
Dispositions” below.

Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the
ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the
assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this
risk, we have control procedures in place to evaluate the
financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the
concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The
selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related
to solvency and



reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well as
on developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the
sharing of risks.

In addition, we also purchase reinsurance when capital
requirements and the economic terms of the reinsurance make it
appropriate to do so.

Business Dispositions

We have exited businesses through reinsurance ceded to third
parties, such as our 2001 sale of the insurance operations of
FFG to The Hartford. The assets backing the liabilities on these
businesses are held in a trust. All separate account business
and John Alden general account business relating to FFG were
transferred through modified coinsurance, a form of proportional
reinsurance in which the underlying assets and liabilities are
still reflected on the ceding company’s balance sheet.
Under this arrangement, The Hartford receives all premiums, pays
all claims and funds all reserve increases net of investment
income on reserves held. All other FFG business was reinsured by
100% coinsurance, which transfers all affected assets and
liabilities as well as all premiums and claims to the assuming
company. We would be responsible for administering this business
in the event of a default by The Hartford.

In 1997, John Alden sold substantially all of its annuity
operations to SunAmerica Life Insurance Company
(“SunAmerica”), now a subsidiary of American
International Group, Inc. In connection with the sale, John
Alden reinsured its existing block of annuity policies to
SunAmerica on a coinsurance basis. This coinsurance was
initially on an indemnity basis and the parties agreed to
transition the business to an assumption basis as soon as
practical. An assumption basis is a form of reinsurance under
which policy administration and the contractual relationship
with the insured, as well as liabilities, pass to the reinsurer.
In certain states, the transition to an assumption basis is
subject to policyholder approval. To the extent that such
transition does not take place with respect to any particular
policy, the policy will remain reinsured on an indemnity basis.
As of December 31, 2004, more than 97% of the ceded annuity
reserves had either transitioned to an assumption basis or had
lapsed.

In 2000, we sold all of our LTC operations to John Hancock. In
connection with the sale, we reinsured our existing block of
long-term care policies to John Hancock on a coinsurance basis.
Under the coinsurance agreement, we transferred 100% of the
policy reserves and related assets on this block of business to
John Hancock, and John Hancock agreed to be responsible for 100%
of the policy benefits. The assets backing the liabilities on
this business are held in a trust and John Hancock is obligated
to fund the trust if the value of the assets is deemed
insufficient to fund the liabilities. If John Hancock fails to
fulfill these obligations, we will be obligated to make these
payments.

Assurant Solutions’ Client Risk and Profit
    Sharing

Historically, our insurance subsidiaries in Assurant Solutions
have ceded a portion of the premiums and risk related to
business generated by certain clients to the client’s
captive insurance companies or to reinsurance companies in which
the clients have an ownership interest. In some cases, our
insurance subsidiaries have assumed a portion of these ceded
premiums and risk from the captive insurance companies and
reinsurance companies. Through these arrangements, our insurance
subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to
client-generated business with these clients. When the
reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in our
insurance subsidiary’s domiciliary state, our insurance
subsidiary generally obtains collateral, such as a trust or a
letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate
in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full
financial credit in the domiciliary state for the third-party
reinsurance. See “Item 7A — Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Credit
Risk.”

In addition, we complied with a John Doe summons received from
the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) requesting
information as to the identities of U.S. taxpayers that
have engaged in producer-owned reinsurance company transactions
in the Turks and Caicos with us. The IRS previously issued
Notice 2002-70, which stated that certain tax benefits claimed
in connection with producer-owned reinsurance company
transactions involving credit insurance transactions with
producers who own reinsurance companies located in



the Turks and Caicos will be denied and is investigating whether
tax benefits claimed by the taxpayers they wish to identify are
available. IRS Notice 2004-65 modified Notice 2002-70 by
removing these transactions from the transactions listed under
that notice. This summons did not raise any issue in the
investigation relating to our tax liability and we have been
notified that this matter is closed.

Claims Provisions/ Reserves

In accordance with industry and accounting practices and
applicable insurance laws and regulatory requirements, we
establish reserves for payment of claims and claims expenses for
claims that arise from our insurance policies. We maintain
reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims expenses.
Policy reserves represent the accumulation of the premiums
received that are set aside to provide for future benefits and
expenses on claims not yet incurred. Claim reserves are
established for future payments and associated expenses not yet
due on claims that have already been incurred, whether reported
to us or not. Reserves, whether calculated under Accounting
Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) or Statutory Accounting Principles
(“SAP”), do not represent an exact calculation of
future policy benefits and expenses but are instead estimates
made by us using actuarial and statistical procedures. There can
be no assurance that any such reserves would be sufficient to
fund our future liabilities in all circumstances. Future loss
development could require reserves to be increased, which would
adversely affect earnings in current and/or future periods.
Adjustments to reserve amounts may be required in the event of
changes from the assumptions regarding future morbidity, the
incidence of disability claims and the rate of recovery,
including the effects thereon of inflation and other societal
and economic factors, persistency, mortality, property claim
frequency and severity and the interest rates used in
calculating the reserve amounts. The reserves reflected in our
consolidated financial statements are calculated in accordance
with GAAP.

See “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates —
Reserves.”

Reserves are regularly reviewed and updated, using the most
current information. Any adjustments are reflected in the
current results of operations. However, because the
establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process,
there can be no assurance that ultimate losses will not exceed
existing reserves.

Reserves are reviewed at least quarterly by our business segment
management.

Investments

The investment portfolio is a critical part of our business
activities and important to our overall profitability. The
fundamental investment philosophy is to manage assets, within
our stated risk parameters, to generate consistent and high
levels of investment income, before gains and losses, while
providing a total return that is competitive over the long-term.
Our investment team is charged with: maintaining safety of
principal and sufficient liquidity; managing credit, interest
rate, prepayment and market risks; maintaining



adequate diversification among asset classes, industry
concentrations and individual issuers; and adhering to all
applicable regulatory requirements.

We have individual business segments with different needs and
characteristics. Hence, our investment approach for each
business segment is tailored to that business segment’s
needs in terms of asset allocation, liquidity needs and duration
of assets and liabilities.

Organization

The general account is managed by our asset management
department, Assurant Asset Management (“AAM”). In this
capacity, AAM acts as both our investment advisor and our asset
manager. As investment advisor, the AAM organization oversees
the design and implementation of overall investment policy. As
asset manager, AAM is responsible for (i) directly
investing those general account assets for which the department
has in-house expertise and (ii) selecting and monitoring
outside managers for those assets for which AAM has limited
expertise. AAM fulfills these roles through its involvement in
the establishment of risk management techniques, business
segment investment policy and asset benchmark construction and
through leadership and participation in our two investment
oversight entities: the Company’s risk management committee
and the individual business segment investment committees.

Our risk management committee consists of the Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer,
Corporate Actuary and Head of Strategic Analysis. It meets
quarterly and is responsible for setting overall corporate risk
tolerance for the general account. As such, it approves all
investment risk limits including those affecting overall
portfolio quality, liquidity, duration and asset class
concentration. Additionally, it approves the use of new asset
classes when appropriate and business segment asset allocation
and investment policy.

The business segment investment committees meet quarterly and
are co-chaired by the business segment Chief Financial Officer
and either the Co-Head of Fixed Income Investments or the Head
of Mortgage and Real Estate Investments. These committees are
responsible for setting appropriate asset allocation and
investment policy for our specific business segments.
Additionally, they monitor investment strategy, performance,
pricing and liability cash flows and research and recommend the
use of new asset classes.

These committees, together with AAM, manage the overall risk
parameters of our investment portfolios and seek to employ
investment policies and strategies that are appropriate for and
supportive of the needs of the individual businesses.

The portfolio and investment performance results are reviewed
quarterly with our board of directors.

Investment Process

Our investment process is initiated by the strategic analysis
group within AAM. This group designs an appropriate asset
allocation benchmark for each portfolio that is tailored to the
associated liabilities and is designed to generate the highest
level of investment income available given each business
segment’s overall risk tolerance. Although income is the
primary objective, total return is a significant secondary
objective. We operate our business through multiple legal
entities. At least one portfolio is maintained for each legal
entity. In addition, separate portfolios are maintained for
legal entities that conduct business for more than one business
segment. The maturities of the assets are selected so as to
satisfy a duration corridor for each portfolio that is
appropriate to its underlying liabilities. Duration is the
sensitivity of the portfolio to movements of interest rates. The
actual duration is dynamic and will change with time and
interest rate movement, as will the liability duration. The
duration corridor is chosen by analyzing various risk/reward
measures from appropriate asset/liability studies. The duration
of our portfolio as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was 5.97
and 5.92 years, respectively. This represents the
amalgamated duration of our four operating business segments
that is directly tied to their liabilities, many of which are
short-tail. It is our intent to manage the portfolios such that
their durations closely match the liabilities that they support.

In addition, the asset allocation benchmark will reflect
multiple constraints, such as all risk tolerances established by
our risk management committee, appropriate credit structure,
prepayment risk tolerance,



liquidity requirements, capital efficiency, tax considerations
and regulatory and rating agency requirements. The individual
benchmarks are then aggregated together to give a total asset
profile. Asset management is conducted at the portfolio level;
however, risk constraints are also in place for the aggregate
portfolio. Each benchmark is reviewed at least annually for
appropriateness.

Our investment portfolios are invested in the following key
asset classes: fixed income securities, including
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities; preferred
stocks; commercial mortgage loans; and commercial real estate.
The investment portfolio contains private placements, including
144A securities. Currently we hold $1,087 million in 144A
securities and $220 million in other private placements. We
began investing in other private placement loans in the fourth
quarter of 2003 and ultimately over the next few years intend to
invest $500 million in other private placements. We do not
currently invest new money in equity securities; however, we may
do so in the future. As of December 31, 2004, less than 1%
of the fair value of our total invested assets was invested in
common stock.

Changes in individual security values are monitored on a regular
basis in order to identify potential credit problems. In
addition, each month the portfolio holdings are screened for
securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less of their
original purchase price. Management then makes their assessment
as to which of these securities are other than temporarily
impaired. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to,
the financial condition of the issuer, any collateral held and
the length of time the market value of the security has been
below cost. Each quarter the watchlist is discussed at a meeting
attended by members of our investment, accounting and finance
departments. At this meeting, any security whose price decrease
is deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired is
written down to its then current market level, with the amount
of the writedown reflected in our statement of operations for
that quarter. Previously impaired issues are also monitored
monthly, with additional writedowns taken quarterly if necessary.

Fixed Income Portfolio Process

AAM controls the credit risk in the fixed income portfolio
through a combination of issuer level credit research and
portfolio level credit risk management. At the issuer level, we
maintain a credit database that contains both qualitative and
quantitative assessments of over 200 issuers and 35 industries.
At the portfolio level, we control credit risk primarily through
quality and industry diversification, individual issuer limits
based upon credit rating and a sell discipline designed to
reduce quickly exposure to deteriorating credits. In addition,
we monitor changes in individual security values on a
semi-monthly basis in order to identify potential problem
credits. This process is also incorporated into our impairment
watchlist process. The risks in the fixed income portfolio are
controlled and monitored.

In order to invest in a wide variety of asset classes in our
portfolio and to appropriately manage the accompanying risks, we
had outsourced the management of approximately 16.1% of our
portfolio’s market value as of December 31, 2004. We
have engaged Wellington Management Co. for high yield
investments, Spectrum Asset Management, Inc. and
Flaherty & Crumrine Inc. for preferred stock
investments, Prudential Private Placement Investors, LP for our
private placements and Lancaster Investment Counsel and Phillips
Hager & North Investment Management Ltd. for our
Canadian investment portfolios.

Commercial Mortgage Loans Investment Process

We originate fixed rate, first commercial mortgage loans through
a nationwide group of exclusive, regional mortgage
correspondents. We have a mortgage loan committee within AAM
that is responsible for the approval of our mortgage loan
related investments. Generally the mortgage correspondents
service the loans they originate and we regularly meet with them
to help foster a strong working relationship. We are a portfolio
lender and generally hold our commercial mortgage loans to
maturity. We typically do not securitize or otherwise sell our
commercial mortgage loans.

A potential loss reserve based on historical data adjusted for
current expectations is maintained and is typically between
1.25% and 2.25% of commercial mortgage loans on real estate. As
of December 31, 2004, the reserve was approximately 1.7% of
the unpaid principal of our commercial mortgage loans, or
$18 million.



Investment Real Estate Process

We invest in income-producing commercial properties to generate
attractive risk-adjusted returns as well as to generate
operating investment income with the potential for capital gains
upon sale of the property. We invest with regional operating
partners who generally invest capital in the property with us
and provide management and leasing services. Our portfolio is
diversified by location, property type, operating partner and
lease term. Property types include office buildings,
warehouse/industrial buildings and multi-family housing.

Portfolio Composition

Our total invested assets were $12,148 million and
$11,344 million, or 50% and 47%, of our total assets, as of
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.
Our net investment income for the year ended December 31,
2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003 was 9% and 9%,
respectively, of our total revenue, excluding realized
investment losses and gains. We had a net realized gain on
investments of $24 million and $2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003,
respectively. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of:
fixed income securities, including mortgage-backed and other
asset-backed securities; preferred stocks; private placement
loans, commercial mortgage loans; and commercial real estate.

As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, fixed
maturity securities accounted for 76% and 77%, respectively, of
our total invested assets. The corporate bond portfolio is well
diversified across industry classes.

The following table sets forth the carrying value of the
securities held in our investment portfolio at the dates
indicated:

Investment Results

The overall income yield on our investments after investment
expenses, excluding net realized investment gains (losses), was
5.45% for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 5.61% for
the year ended December 31, 2003. The overall income yield
on our investments after investment expenses, including realized
gains (losses), was 5.66% for the year ended December 31,
2004 and 5.63% for the year ended December 31, 2003.



The following table sets forth the income yield and net
investment income, excluding realized investment gains/(losses),
for each major investment category for the periods indicated.

(1)

The yield is calculated by dividing income by average assets.
    The yield calculation for the year ended December 31, 2004
    includes the average of asset positions as of December 31,
    2003 and December 31, 2004. The yield calculation for the
    year ended December 31, 2003 includes the average of asset
    positions as of December 31, 2002 and December 31,
    2003.

(2)

Total return is calculated using beginning and ending market
    portfolio value adjusted for external cash flows.

(3)

The actual portfolio is customized for the liabilities that it
    supports. It will therefore differ from the Lehman Index, both
    in asset allocation and duration. As of December 31, 2004,
    the actual portfolio had a duration of 5.97 years with 3%
    of the total portfolio in U.S. Government securities, 67%
    in U.S. credit and 13% in securitized assets. Commercial
    mortgages and real estate comprised the remainder of the
    portfolio. In contrast, the Lehman Index had a duration of
    4.34 years with 36% in U.S. Government securities, 25%
    in U.S. credit and 39% in securitized assets.

Virtually all of our fixed maturity securities portfolio is
publicly traded. Our investment portfolio contains private
placements, including 144A securities. We have recently
initiated the private placement program and plan to invest
approximately $500 million in other privately placed
securities over the next two years. Currently, we have less than
3% of our fixed maturity securities invested in other private
placements, excluding 144A securities. As of December 31,
2004, approximately 92% of the fair market value of our fixed
maturity securities were dollar denominated. As of
December 31, 2004, we had approximately $710
(Canadian) million invested in Canadian fixed maturity
securities; however, these assets directly support Canadian
liabilities.

Commercial Mortgage Loans

We have made commercial mortgage loans, collateralized by the
underlying real estate, on properties located throughout the
United States. At December 31, 2004 approximately 41% of
the outstanding principal balance of commercial mortgage loans
was concentrated in the states of California, New York, and
Pennslyvania. Although we have a diversified loan portfolio, an
economic downturn could have an adverse impact on the ability of
our debtors to repay their loans. At December 31, 2004, the
outstanding balances of commercial mortgage loans ranged in size
from less than $1 million to $13 million with an
average outstanding balance of $2.2 million. Loan
commitments outstanding at December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003 totaled $32 million and
$76 million, respectively.

Investment Real Estate

We also hold commercial equity real estate as part of our
investment portfolio. We own real estate through real estate
joint ventures and partnerships. Investments in real estate
joint ventures totaled $57 million as of December 31,
2004 and 2003. Investments in limited partnership totaled
$37 million and $31 million at December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively. The main property types within our
portfolio are office, industrial/warehouse and multi-family
housing. At December 31, 2004, we are committed to fund
additional capital contributions of $15 million to joint
ventures and $14 million to certain investments in limited
partnerships.

Competition

We face competition in each of our businesses; however, we
believe that no single competitor competes against us in all of
our business lines and the business lines in which we operate
are generally characterized by a limited number of competitors.
Competition in our operating business segments is based on a
number of factors, including: quality of service, product
features, price, scope of distribution, financial strength
ratings and name recognition.

The relative importance of these factors depends on the
particular product and market. We compete for customers and
distributors with insurance companies and other financial
services companies in our various businesses.



Assurant Solutions has numerous competitors in its product
lines, but we believe no other company participates in all of
the same lines or offers comparable comprehensive capabilities.
Competitors include insurance companies and financial
institutions. In Assurant Health, we believe the market is
characterized by many competitors, and our main competitors
include health insurance companies and the Blue Cross/ Blue
Shield plans in the states in which we write business. In
Assurant Employee Benefits, commercial competitors include other
life insurance companies as well as not-for-profit Delta Dental
plans. In Assurant PreNeed, our main competitors are two
pre-need life insurance companies with nationwide
representation, Forethought Financial Services and Homesteaders
Life Company, and several small regional insurers. While we are
among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many
of our business lines, in some cases there are one or more major
market players in a particular line of business.

Some of these companies may offer more competitive pricing,
greater diversity of distribution, better brand recognition or
higher financial strength ratings than we have. Some may also
have greater financial resources with which to compete. In
addition, many of our insurance products, particularly our group
benefits and health insurance policies, are underwritten
annually and, accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers
may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors
rather than renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition
may, as a result, adversely affect the persistency of these and
other products, as well as our ability to sell products in the
future.

Ratings

Rating organizations continually review the financial positions
of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries. Insurance
companies are assigned financial strength ratings by independent
rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders.
Ratings provide both industry participants and insurance
consumers meaningful information on specific insurance companies
and are an important factor in establishing the competitive
position of insurance companies. Most of our active domestic
operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best. A.M.
Best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from
“A++” (Superior) to “S” (Suspended). Six of
our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are also rated by
Moody’s. In addition, seven of our domestic operating
insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P.

All of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries rated by
A.M. Best have financial strength ratings of A
(“Excellent”), which is the second highest of ten
ratings categories and the highest within the category based on
modifiers (i.e., A and A- are “Excellent”), or A-
(“Excellent”), which is the second highest of ten
ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on
modifiers.

The Moody’s financial strength rating for one of our
domestic operating insurance subsidiaries is
A2 (“Good”), which is the third highest of nine
ratings categories and mid-range within the category based on
modifiers (i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are “Good”), and for
five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries is A3
(“Good”), which is the third highest of nine ratings
categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers.

The S&P financial strength rating for four of our domestic
operating insurance subsidiaries is A (“Strong”),
which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and
mid-range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A
and A- are “Strong”), and for three of our domestic
operating insurance subsidiaries is A- (“Strong”),
which is the third highest of nine ratings categories and the
lowest within the category based on modifiers.

The objective of A.M. Best’s, Moody’s and
S&P’s ratings systems is to assist policyholders and to
provide an opinion of an insurer’s financial strength,
operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet
ongoing obligations to its policyholders. These ratings reflect
the opinions of A.M. Best, Moody’s and S&P of our
ability to pay policyholder claims, are not applicable to our
common stock or debt securities and are not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold any security, including our common stock or
debt securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by
and may be revised upward, downward or revoked at the sole
discretion of A.M. Best, Moody’s and S&P.



REGULATION

United States

State Regulation

General

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the
various states and jurisdictions in which they transact
business. The extent of regulation varies, but generally derives
from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and
administrative authority to a department of insurance in each
state. The regulation, supervision and administration relate,
among other things, to: standards of solvency that must be met
and maintained, the payment of dividends, changes of control of
insurance companies, the licensing of insurers and their agents,
the types of insurance that may be written, guaranty funds, high
risk and reinsurance pools, privacy practices, the ability to
enter and exit certain insurance markets, the nature of and
limitations on investments, premium rates, or restrictions on
the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy,
reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other
obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders, payment of sales compensation to third parties,
approval of policy forms, and the regulation of market conduct,
including underwriting and claims practices.

State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations
of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of
annual and other reports, prepared under SAP, relating to the
financial condition of companies and other matters. Financial
examinations completed during the past three years with respect
to our operating subsidiaries have not resulted in material
negative adjustments to statutory surplus and pending financial
and market conduct examinations with respect to these
subsidiaries have not identified any material findings to date.
Two of our subsidiaries have responded affirmatively to an NAIC
survey regarding race-based premiums, resulting in examinations
by two state insurance departments. This relates to actions of
the subsidiaries or predecessor companies before acquisition by
us. One examination has been concluded and one is still in
progress and, to date, no penalties have been imposed as a
result of these examinations. The amount of in force business as
to which these subsidiaries charged race-based premiums is very
small, representing less than 1% of our in force block of
business at December 31, 2004. While we do not expect that
these examinations will have a material adverse effect on us,
there can be no assurance that further examinations or
litigation will not occur with respect to race-based premiums.

Recently, the insurance industry has been the subject of several
investigations and increased regulatory activity by various
state regulators and enforcement authorities concerning certain
business practices, including the payment of contingent
commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and
agents, and the extent to which such compensation has been
disclosed, the solicitation and provision of fictitious or
inflated quotes, the use of inducements to brokers or companies
in the sales of group insurance products, and the accounting
treatment for finite reinsurance or other non-traditional or
loss mitigation insurance products. We have received inquiries
and informational requests from various insurance departments in
certain states in which our insurance subsidiaries operate. To
date, none of these inquiries, nor our own internal review, has
resulted in any determination or finding that we have provided
inflated or fictitious quotes or used improper inducements in
the sale of our insurance products. For further information
concerning the risks related to this and other regulatory
actions and litigation see “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Risk Factors.”

At the present time, our insurance subsidiaries are collectively
licensed to transact business in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia, although several of our insurance
subsidiaries individually are licensed in only one or a few
states. We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states
of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah,
Wisconsin, and in Puerto Rico.



Regulation of Credit Insurance Products

Most states and other jurisdictions in which our insurance
subsidiaries do business have enacted laws and regulations that
apply specifically to consumer credit insurance. The methods of
regulation vary but generally relate to, among other things, the
amount and term of coverage, the content of required disclosures
to debtors, the filing and approval of policy forms and rates,
the ability to provide creditor-placed insurance and limitations
on the amount of premiums that may be charged and on the amount
of compensation that may be paid as a percentage of premiums. In
addition, some jurisdictions have enacted or are considering
regulations that may limit profitability arising from credit
insurance based on underwriting experience.

The regulation of credit insurance is also affected by judicial
activity. For example, federal court decisions have enhanced the
ability of national banks to engage in activities that
effectively compete with our consumer credit insurance business
without being subject to various aspects of state insurance
regulation.

Regulation of Service Contracts and Warranties

The extent of regulation over the sale of service contracts and
warranties varies considerably from state to state. In the
states that do regulate the sales of these products, the
regulations generally are less stringent than those applicable
to the sale of insurance. For example, most states do not
require the filing and approval of contract forms and rates for
service contracts and warranties. States that do regulate such
contract forms typically require specific wording regarding
cancellation rights and regarding the consumer’s rights in
the event of a claim. Most states do not require that individual
salespersons of service contracts and warranties be licensed as
insurance agents. In the states that do require such a license,
salespersons may qualify for a limited license to sell service
contracts and warranties without meeting the education and
examination requirements applicable to insurance agents. In
addition, the compensation paid to salespersons of service
contracts and warranties is generally not regulated.

Regulation of Health Insurance Products

State regulation of health insurance products varies from state
to state, although all states regulate premium rates, policy
forms and underwriting and claims practices to one degree or
another. Most states have special rules for health insurance
sold to individuals and small groups. For example, a number of
states have passed or are considering legislation that would
limit the differentials in rates that insurers could charge for
health care coverage between new business and renewal business
for small groups with similar demographics. Every state has also
adopted legislation that would make health insurance available
to all small employer groups by requiring coverage of all
employees and their dependents, by limiting the applicability of
pre-existing conditions exclusions, by requiring insurers to
offer a basic plan exempt from certain benefits as well as a
standard plan, or by establishing a mechanism to spread the risk
of high risk employees to all small group insurers. The
U.S. Congress and various state legislators have from time
to time proposed changes to the health care system that could
affect the relationship between health insurers and their
customers, including external review. In addition, various
states are considering the adoption of “play or pay”
laws requiring that employers either offer health insurance or
pay a tax to cover the costs of public health care insurance. We
cannot predict with certainty the effect that any proposals, if
adopted, or legislative developments could have on our insurance
businesses and operations.

A number of states have enacted new health insurance legislation
over the past several years. These laws, among other things,
mandate benefits with respect to certain diseases or medical
procedures, require health insurers to offer an independent
external review of certain coverage decisions and establish
health insurer liability. There has also been an increase in
legislation regarding, among other things, prompt payment of
claims, privacy of personal health information, health insurer
liability, prohibition against insurers including discretionary
clauses in their policy forms and relationships between health
insurers and providers. We expect that this trend of increased
legislation will continue. These laws may have the effect of
increasing our costs and expenses.

In most states in which we operate, we provide our individual
health insurance products through an association. The use of
associations offers greater flexibility on pricing, underwriting
and product design



compared to products sold directly to individuals on a true
individual policy basis due to the greater regulatory scrutiny
of true individual policies. The marketing of health insurance
through association groups has recently come under increased
scrutiny. An interruption in, or changes to, our relationships
with various third-party distributors or our inability to
respond to regulatory changes could impair our ability to
compete and market our insurance products and services and
materially adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

Regulation of Employee Benefits Products

State regulation of non-medical group products, including group
term life insurance, group disability and group dental products,
also varies from state to state. As with individual insurance
products, the regulation of these products generally also
includes oversight over premium rates and policy forms, but
often to a lesser degree. The regulatory environment for group
term life insurance is relatively established, with few
significant changes from year to year.

Group PPO dental insurance policies are generally regulated in
the same manner as non-PPO dental policies, except to the extent
that a small number of states have chosen to restrict the
difference in benefits allowable between in-network and
out-of-network services. Also, some states directly regulate the
operation of the PPO network by requiring separate licensing or
registration for the organization that contracts with the
providers of dental care. In those states, PPOs also must comply
with varying levels of regulatory oversight concerning the
content of PPO contracts and provider practice standards. Most
of the states in which prepaid dental plans are written
recognize prepaid dental plans as an activity separate from
traditional insurance, because providers are compensated through
capitation arrangements. In most of these states, prepaid dental
plans are written by a single-purpose, single-state affiliate
that holds a license distinct from the life and health insurance
license required for group dental insurance policies. Entities
providing prepaid plans are variously licensed as Health
Maintenance Organizations (“HMO”), prepaid dental
plans, limited service health plans, life and health insurers or
risk-bearing PPOs, where such licenses are required. Each state
has different rules regarding organization, capitalization and
reporting for the separate entities, with additional variations
relating to provider contracting, oversight, plan management and
plan operations.

Providers of group disability and dental insurance, like
providers of group health insurance, are subject to state
privacy laws, claims processing rules and “prompt pay”
requirements in various states.

As an extension of past legislative activities in the medical
insurance arena, legislative and regulatory consideration, at
both the federal at state levels, is being directed toward an
effort to mandate what its proponents call “mental health
parity” in the policy provisions of group disability
insurance plans. This would require providers of group
disability insurance to extend the same benefits for
disabilities related to mental illness as are provided for other
disabilities.

Group benefit plans and the claims thereunder are also largely
subject to federal regulation under ERISA, a complex set of laws
and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the
IRS and the Department of Labor. Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (“ERISA”) regulates certain aspects of
the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee
benefit plans subject to ERISA. Some of our administrative
services and other activities may also be subject to regulation
under ERISA.

Regulation of Pre-Funded Funeral Insurance Products

State regulation of the pre-funded funeral insurance products
business varies considerably from state to state. Our pre-funded
funeral insurance products are typically structured as small
whole life insurance policies, usually under $10,000 face
amount, and are regulated as such by the states. State laws also
restrict who may sell a pre-funded funeral. For example, in
certain states a pre-funded funeral may only be offered through
licensed funeral directors. In New York, the payment of
commissions to a funeral director for the sale of insurance is
prohibited.

State privacy laws, particularly those with “opt-in”
clauses, can also affect the pre-funded funeral insurance
business. These laws make it harder to share information for
marketing purposes, such as generating



new sales leads. Similarly, state “do not call” lists,
as well as the recently created national “do not call”
list, also make it more difficult for our pre-funded funeral
insurance agents to solicit new customers, particularly on a
cold call basis.

In certain states, insurance companies offering pre-funded
funeral insurance products must offer a “free-look
period” of typically 30 days, during which the
purchaser of the product may cancel and receive a full refund.
Furthermore, in certain states, death benefits under pre-funded
funeral insurance products must grow with the CPI.

Insurance Holding Company Statutes

Although as a holding company, Assurant, Inc. is not regulated
as an insurance company, we own capital stock in insurance
subsidiaries and therefore are subject to state insurance
holding company statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each
of the states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries. All
holding company statutes, as well as other laws, require
disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of material
transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate. The
holding company statutes as well as other laws also require,
among other things, prior approval of an acquisition of control
of a domestic insurer, some transactions between affiliates and
the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions.

Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends

The payment of dividends to us by any of our insurance
subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e., extraordinary
dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary’s domiciliary
state department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no
regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to
amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The
formula for the majority of the states in which our subsidiaries
are domiciled is the lesser of (i) 10% of the statutory
surplus as of the end of the prior year or (ii) the prior
year’s statutory net income. In some states, the formula is
the greater amount of clauses (i) and (ii). Some states,
however, have an additional stipulation that dividends may only
be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine
that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by
our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax
sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services)
would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators
may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted
without prior approval. Based on the dividend restrictions under
applicable laws and regulations, the maximum amount of dividends
that our subsidiaries could pay to us in 2005 without regulatory
approval is approximately $364 million. Dividends paid by
our subsidiaries totaled $361.7 million through
December 31, 2004.

SAP

SAP is a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance
regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of
insurance companies. It is primarily concerned with measuring an
insurer’s statutory surplus. Accordingly, statutory
accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers
at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate
insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each
insurer’s domiciliary state.

GAAP is concerned with a company’s solvency, but it is also
concerned with other financial measurements, such as income and
cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to
appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for
management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a
direct result, different assets and liabilities and different
amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as opposed to SAP.

SAP established by the NAIC and adopted, for the most part, by
the various state insurance regulators determine, among other
things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income
of our insurance subsidiaries and thus determine, in part, the
amount of funds they have available to pay as dividends to us.



Assessments for Guaranty Funds

Virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in
their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some
insureds as a result of the insolvency of other insurers.
Depending upon state law, insurers can be assessed an amount
that is generally equal to between 1% and 3% of premiums written
for the relevant lines of insurance in that state each year to
pay the claims of an insolvent insurer. A portion of these
payments is recoverable through premium rates, premium tax
credits or policy surcharges. Significant increases in
assessments could limit the ability of our insurance
subsidiaries to recover such assessments through tax credits or
other means. In addition, there have been some legislative
efforts to limit or repeal the tax offset provisions, which
efforts, to date, have been generally unsuccessful. These
assessments are expected to increase in the future.

Insurance Regulations Concerning Change of Control

Many state insurance regulatory laws intended primarily for the
protection of policyholders contain provisions that require
advance approval by the state insurance commissioner of any
change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled, or,
in some cases, having such substantial business that it is
deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that state. Prior to
granting such approval, the state insurance commissioner will
consider such factors as the financial strength of the
applicant, the integrity of the applicant’s board of
directors and executive officers, the applicant’s plans for
the future operations of the domestic insurer and any
anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of
the acquisition of control. We own, directly or indirectly, all
of the shares of stock of insurance companies domiciled in the
states listed in the “General” section above.
“Control” is generally presumed to exist through the
ownership of 10% (5% in the case of Florida, in which certain of
our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled) or more of the voting
securities of a domestic insurance company or of any company
that controls a domestic insurance company. Any purchaser of
shares of common stock representing 10% (5% in the case of
Florida) or more of the voting power of our capital stock will
be presumed to have acquired control of our domestic insurance
subsidiaries unless, following application by that purchaser in
each insurance subsidiary’s state of domicile, the relevant
insurance commissioner determines otherwise.

In addition to these filings, the laws of many states contain
provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to
any change in control of a non-domestic insurance company
admitted to transact business in that state. While these
pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to
disapprove the change of control, they do authorize issuance of
cease and desist orders with respect to the non-domestic insurer
if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market
concentration, would result from the acquisition.

Any future transactions that would constitute a change in
control of any of our insurance subsidiaries would generally
require prior approval by the insurance departments of the
states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or
commercially domiciled and may require pre-acquisition
notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition
notification provisions and in which such insurance subsidiaries
are admitted to transact business. Regulatory approval for a
change of control may also be required in one or more of the
foreign jurisdictions in which we have insurance subsidiaries.

These requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions
affecting the control of our common stock, including
transactions that could be advantageous to our stockholders.

Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”)

The NAIC IRIS was developed to help state regulators identify
companies that may require special attention. The IRIS system
consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby
financial examiners review annual statements and financial
ratios. The statistical phase consists of 12 key financial
ratios based on year-end data that are generated from the NAIC
database annually; each ratio has an established “usual
range” of results. These ratios assist state insurance
departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the
financial condition of insurance companies.



A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios is
not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are
viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system.
Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for
financially sound companies to have several ratios with results
outside the usual ranges. Generally, an insurance company will
become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the
usual ranges of four or more of the ratios. In the past,
variances in certain ratios of our insurance subsidiaries have
resulted in inquiries from insurance departments, to which we
have responded. These inquiries have not led to any restrictions
affecting our operations.

Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) Requirements

In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the NAIC
has adopted formulas and model laws to implement RBC
requirements for life and health insurers, for property and
casualty insurers, and, most recently, for health organizations.
These formulas and model laws are designed to determine minimum
capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that
statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations.

Under laws adopted by individual states, insurers having less
total adjusted capital (generally, as defined by the NAIC), than
that required by the relevant RBC formula will be subject to
varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of
capital inadequacy. The RBC laws provide for four levels of
regulatory action. The extent of regulatory intervention and
action increases as the ratio of total adjusted capital to RBC
falls. The first level, the company action level, requires an
insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the regulator
if total adjusted capital falls below 200% of the RBC amount (or
below 250%, when the insurer has a “negative trend” as
defined under the RBC laws). The second level, the regulatory
action level, requires an insurer to submit a plan containing
corrective actions and requires the relevant insurance
commissioner to perform an examination or other analysis and
issue a corrective order if total adjusted capital falls below
150% of the RBC amount. The third level, the authorized control
level, authorizes the relevant insurance commissioner to take
whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect the
best interests of the policyholders and creditors of the
insurer, which may include the actions necessary to cause the
insurer to be placed under regulatory control, i.e.,
rehabilitation or liquidation, if total adjusted capital falls
below 100% of the RBC amount. The fourth action level is the
mandatory control level, which requires the relevant insurance
commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control if
total adjusted capital falls below 70% of the RBC amount.

The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among
adequately capitalized companies that operate with higher levels
of capital. Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to
use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. At
December 31, 2004, all of our insurance subsidiaries had
total adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring company or
regulatory action at any prescribed RBC action level.

Federal Regulation

General

In 1945, the U.S. Congress enacted the McCarran-Ferguson
Act which declared the regulation of insurance to be primarily
the responsibility of the individual states. Although repeal of
McCarran-Ferguson is debated in the U.S. Congress from time
to time, the federal government generally does not directly
regulate the insurance business. However, federal legislation
and administrative policies in several areas, including
healthcare, pension regulation, age and sex discrimination,
financial services regulation, securities regulation, privacy
laws, terrorism and federal taxation, do affect the insurance
business.

Federal Securities Regulation of Fortis Variable Insurance
    Product Business

Two of our subsidiaries, Fortis Benefits Insurance Company and
First Fortis Life Insurance Company, are subject to various
federal securities regulations because they have been involved
in the issuance of variable insurance products that are required
to be registered as securities under the Securities Act. These
registered insurance contracts, which are no longer being sold,
have been 100% reinsured with The Hartford through modified
coinsurance agreements. The Hartford now administers this closed
block of business pursuant to a third-party administration
agreement. Nevertheless, because these two subsidiaries are
still considered the



issuers of the products, they are subject to regulation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As a
result, they must file periodic reports under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) and
are periodically examined for compliance with applicable federal
securities laws by the SEC. See also “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Critical Factors Affecting
Results — Acquisitions and Dispositions of
Businesses.”

HIPAA

As with other lines of insurance, the regulation of health
insurance historically has been within the domain of the states.
However, HIPAA and the implementing regulations promulgated
thereunder by the Department of Health and Human Services impose
new obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance
coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors. HIPAA
requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health
insurance coverage for individuals and small employer groups
(generally 50 or fewer employees) and limits exclusions based on
pre-existing conditions. Most of the insurance reform provisions
of HIPAA became effective for plan years beginning on or after
July 1, 1997.

HIPAA also establishes new requirements for maintaining the
confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health
information and new standards for electronic health care
transactions. The Department of Health and Human Services
promulgated final HIPAA regulations in 2002. The privacy
regulations required compliance by April 2003, the electronic
transactions regulations by October 2003 and the security
regulations by April 2005. As have other entities in the health
care industry, we have incurred substantial costs in meeting the
requirements of these HIPAA regulations and expect to continue
to incur costs to achieve and to maintain compliance. We have
been working diligently to comply with these regulations in the
time periods required. However, there can be no assurances that
we will achieve such compliance with all of the required
transactions or that other entities with which we interact will
take appropriate action to meet the compliance deadlines.
Moreover, as a consequence of these new standards for electronic
transactions, we may see an increase in the number of health
care transactions that are submitted to us in paper format,
which could increase our costs to process medical claims.

HIPAA is far-reaching and complex and proper interpretation and
practice under the law continue to evolve. Consequently, our
efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to
comply with HIPAA are ongoing. Failure to comply could result in
regulatory fines and civil lawsuits. Knowing and intentional
violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal
penalties.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act

On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was
enacted to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for
terrorist acts in the United States. This law requires insurers
writing certain lines of property and casualty insurance to
offer coverage against certain acts of terrorism causing damage
within the United States or to U.S. flagged vessels or
aircraft. In return, the law requires the federal government to
indemnify such insurers for 90% of insured losses resulting from
covered acts of terrorism, subject to a premium-based
deductible. Any existing policy exclusions for such coverage
were immediately nullified by the law, although such exclusions
may be reinstated if either the insured consents to
reinstatement or fails to pay any applicable increase in premium
resulting from the additional coverage within 30 days of
being notified of such an increase. It should be noted that an
“act of terrorism” as defined by the law excludes
purely domestic terrorism. For an act of terrorism to have
occurred, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury must make
several findings, including that the act was committed on behalf
of a foreign person or foreign interest. The law expires
automatically at the end of 2005, although legislation has been
introduced to extend the law through 2007.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act required the
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to conduct an expedited
study as to whether or not group life insurance should be
covered under the law. Based on the study, the Secretary
concluded that inclusion of group life insurance was not
appropriate.

We have a geographically diverse block of group life business
and have secured limited reinsurance protection against
catastrophic losses in our group life product line.
Nevertheless, we are exposed to the risk of substantial group
life losses from a catastrophe, including a terrorist act.



Given that our property and casualty insurance products
primarily cover personal residences and personal property, we do
not believe our property and casualty exposure to terrorist acts
to be significant.

Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001(“USA PATRIOT
    Act”)

On October 26, 2001, the International Money Laundering
Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001 was enacted
into law as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. Among its many
provisions the law requires that financial institutions adopt
anti-money laundering programs that include policies, procedures
and controls to detect and prevent money laundering, designate a
compliance officer to oversee the program and provide for
employee training, and periodic audits in accordance with
regulations proposed by the U.S. Treasury Department.
Proposed Treasury regulations governing portions of our life
insurance business would require us to develop and implement
procedures designed to detect and prevent money laundering and
terrorist financing. We remain subject to U.S. regulations
that prohibit business dealings with entities identified as
threats to national security. We have licensed software to
enable us to detect and prevent such activities in compliance
with existing regulations and we are developing policies and
procedures designed to comply with the proposed regulations
should they come into effect.

There are significant criminal and civil penalties that can be
imposed for violation of the aforementioned Treasury
regulations. We believe that the steps we are taking to comply
with the current regulations and to prepare for compliance with
the proposed regulations should be sufficient to minimize the
risks of such penalties.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act

On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
became law, implementing fundamental changes in the regulation
of the financial services industry in the United States. The Act
permits the transformation of the already converging banking,
insurance and securities industries by permitting mergers that
combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms under
one holding company. Under the Act, national banks retain their
existing ability to sell insurance products in some
circumstances. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify
and elect to be treated as “financial holding
companies” may engage in activities, and acquire companies
engaged in activities, that are “financial” in nature
or “incidental” or “complementary” to such
financial activities, including acting as principal, agent or
broker in selling life, property and casualty and other forms of
insurance, including annuities. A financial holding company can
own any kind of insurance company or insurance broker or agent,
but its bank subsidiary cannot own the insurance company. Under
state law, the financial holding company would need to apply to
the insurance commissioner in the insurer’s state of
domicile for prior approval of the acquisition of the insurer,
and the act provides that the commissioner, in considering the
application, may not discriminate against the financial holding
company because it is affiliated with a bank. Under the Act, no
state may prevent or interfere with affiliations between banks
and insurers, insurance agents or brokers, or the licensing of a
bank or affiliate as an insurer or agent or broker. Privacy
provisions of the Act became fully effective in 2001. These
provisions established consumer protections regarding the
security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information
and require us to make full disclosure of our privacy policies
to our customers.

Regulation by the Federal Reserve Board

Fortis Bank, which is a company in the Fortis Group, obtained
approval in 2002 from state banking authorities and the Federal
Reserve to establish branch offices in Connecticut and New York.
By virtue of the opening of these offices, the Fortis
Group’s operations and investments (including the Fortis
Group’s investment in us) became subject to the nonbanking
prohibitions of Section 4 of the U.S. Bank Holding
Company Act (“BHCA”). Except to the extent that a BHCA
exemption or authority is available, Section 4 of the BHCA
does not permit foreign banking organizations with
U.S. branches to own more than 5% of any class of voting
shares or otherwise to control any company that conducts
commercial activities, such as manufacturing, distribution of
goods or real estate development.



To broaden the scope of activities and investments permissible
for the Fortis Group and us, the Fortis Group in 2002 notified
the Federal Reserve of its election to be a “financial
holding company” for purposes of the BHCA and the Federal
Reserve’s implementing regulations in Regulation Y. As
a financial holding company, the Fortis Group may own shares of
companies engaged in activities in the United States that are
“financial in nature,” “incidental to such
financial activity” or “complementary to a financial
activity.” Activities that are “financial in
nature” include, among other things: insuring, guaranteeing
or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability
or death, or providing and issuing annuities and acting as
principal, agent or broker for purposes of the foregoing.

In connection with Fortis Bank’s establishment of
U.S. branches, staff of the Federal Reserve inquired as to
whether certain of our activities are financial in nature under
Section 4(k) of the BHCA. In light of the Fortis
Group’s contemplated divestiture of our shares, this
inquiry was suspended at the Fortis Group’s and our
request. To the extent that any of our activities might be
deemed not to be financial in nature under Section 4(k),
the Fortis Group may rely on an exemption in
Section 4(a)(2) of the BHCA that permits the Fortis Group
to continue to hold interests in companies engaged in activities
that are not financial in nature for an initial period of two
years and, with Federal Reserve approval for each extension, for
up to three additional one-year periods. The Federal Reserve
also has the discretion to permit the Fortis Group to hold such
interests after the five-year period under certain provisions
other than Section 4(a)(2). The initial two-year period
under Section 4(a)(2) expired on December 2, 2004. The
Fortis Group has requested an initial one-year extension of the
divestiture period.

If the Federal Reserve does not grant an extension of the
divestiture period for any one-year period or if Fortis holds
more than 5% of any class of our voting shares after
December 2, 2007, without the consent or acquiescence of
the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve determined that
certain of our activities are nonfinancial, the Fortis Group may
be required (i) to rely on another provision of the BHCA,
(ii) to close the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank, or
(iii) to divest any of our shares exceeding 5% of any class
of our voting shares and to divest any control over us for
purposes of the BHCA.

The Fortis Group will continue to qualify as a financial holding
company so long as Fortis Bank remains “well
capitalized” and “well managed,” as those terms
are defined in Regulation Y. Generally, Fortis Bank will be
considered “well capitalized” if it maintains tier 1
and total RBC ratios of at least 6% and 10%, respectively. The
Fortis Group will be considered “well managed” if it
has received at least a satisfactory composite rating of its
U.S. branch operations at its most recent examination. If
the Fortis Group lost and were unable to regain its financial
holding company status, the Fortis Group could be required
(i) to close the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank or
(ii) to divest any of our shares exceeding 5% of any class
of our voting securities and to divest any control over us for
purposes of the BHCA.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has jurisdiction under the BHCA
over all of the Fortis Group’s direct and indirect
U.S. subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries will be
considered subsidiaries of the Fortis Group for purposes of the
BHCA so long as the Fortis Group owns 25% or more of any class
of our voting shares or otherwise controls or has been
determined to have a controlling influence over us within the
meaning of the BHCA. The Federal Reserve could take the position
that the Fortis Group continues to control us until the Fortis
Group reduces its ownership to less than 5% of our voting
shares. So long as the Fortis Group controls us for purposes of
the BHCA, the Federal Reserve could require us immediately to
discontinue, restructure or divest any of our operations that
are deemed to be impermissible under the BHCA, which could
result in reduced revenues, increased costs or reduced
profitability for us.

Legislative Developments

Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that
would allow state-chartered and regulated insurance companies,
such as our insurance subsidiaries, to choose instead to be
regulated exclusively by a federal insurance regulator. We do
not believe that such legislation will be enacted during the
current Congressional term.

Numerous proposals to reform the current health care system have
been introduced in the U.S. Congress and in various state
legislatures. Proposals have included, among other things,
modifications to the existing



employer-based insurance system, a quasi-regulated system of
“managed competition” among health insurers, and a
single-payer, public program. Changes in health care policy
could significantly affect our business. For example, federally
mandated, comprehensive major medical insurance, if proposed and
implemented, could partially or fully replace some of our
current products. Furthermore, legislation has been introduced
from time to time in the U.S. Congress that could result in
the federal government assuming a more direct role in regulating
insurance companies.

In addition, the U.S. Congress is considering the expansion
of risk retention groups, which were originally established in
1986 to address the lack of available product liability
insurance. Risk retention groups may be chartered in a state
with favorable regulations and then proceed to do business in
any state, even though insurance companies competing in the
other states may be subject to more stringent regulations. This
is a continuing risk to the extended service contract business
at Assurant Solutions.

There is also legislation pending in the U.S. Congress and
in various states designed to provide additional privacy
protections to consumer customers of financial institutions.
These statutes and similar legislation and regulations in the
United States or other jurisdictions could affect our ability to
market our products or otherwise limit the nature or scope of
our insurance operations.

The NAIC and individual states have been studying small face
amount life insurance for the past two years. Some initiatives
that have been raised at the NAIC include further disclosure for
small face amount policies and restrictions on premium to
benefit ratios. The NAIC is also studying other issues such as
“suitability” of insurance products for certain
customers. This may have an effect on our pre-funded funeral
insurance business. Suitability requirements such as a customer
assets and needs worksheet could extend and complicate the sale
of pre-funded funeral insurance products.

MSA’s were created by U.S. Congress as a trial program
in 1996. MSAs allow self-employed individuals, as well as
employees of small employers (i.e., employers with 50 or fewer
employees), to set aside funds on a tax-free basis for the
purpose of paying eligible medical expenses, so long as such
persons are covered under a high-deductible health insurance
policy. MSA health insurance policies have become an important
and growing product line for Assurant Health. On
December 8, 2003, The Act was signed into law. The Act
includes a provision providing for HSAs. In addition, the House
passed a 12-month extension on MSAs, providing a transition
period for the continued offering of MSAs.

We are unable to evaluate new legislation that may be proposed
and when or whether any such legislation will be enacted and
implemented. However, many of the proposals, if adopted, could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash
flows or results of operations, while others, if adopted, could
potentially benefit our business.

Foreign Jurisdictions

A portion of our business is carried on in foreign countries. We
have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Argentina, Brazil,
Mexico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands and
the United Kingdom. Certain subsidiaries operate in Canada under
the branch system. The degree of regulation and supervision in
foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent
in others. Generally, our insurance subsidiaries operating in
such jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements.
Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our insurance
subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such
authorities, and these subsidiaries could be prevented from
conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they
currently operate. In the past, we have been allowed to modify
our operations to conform with new licensing requirements in
most jurisdictions.

In addition to licensing requirements, our foreign operations
are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to:
currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security
deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local
investment and the share of profits to be returned to
policyholders on participating policies.

Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of
policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance
institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which
admitted insurers are obligated to



cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always
allow foreign insurers full compensation. In some countries,
regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and
remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and
repatriation of assets.

Employees

As of March 4, 2005, we had approximately 12,000 employees.
In Assurant Solutions, we have employees in Brazil, Mexico and
Argentina who are represented by labor unions. None of our other
employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements
governing employment with us or represented by labor unions. We
believe that we have an excellent relationship with our
employees.

Item 2.

Properties

We own seven properties, including five buildings that serve as
headquarters locations for our operating business segments and
two buildings that serve as operation centers for Assurant
Solutions. Assurant Solutions has headquarters buildings located
in Miami, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia. Assurant Solutions
operation centers are located in Florence, South Carolina and
Springfield, Ohio. Assurant Employee Benefits has a headquarters
building in Kansas City, Missouri. Assurant Health has a
headquarters building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Assurant
PreNeed’s AMLIC channel has a headquarters building in
Rapid City, South Dakota. We lease office space for various
offices and service centers located throughout the United States
and internationally, including our New York corporate office,
Assurant PreNeed’s independent distribution headquarters in
Atlanta and our data center in Woodbury, Minnesota. Our leases
have terms ranging from month-to-month to twenty-five years. We
believe that our owned and leased properties are adequate for
our current business operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are regularly involved in litigation in the ordinary course
of business, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff. We may from
time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory
actions relating to our current and past business operations.
While we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future
litigation, examination or investigation and although no
assurances can be given, we do not believe that any pending
matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

The Assurant Solutions segment is subject to a number of pending
actions, primarily in the State of Mississippi, many of which
allege that our credit insurance products were packaged and sold
with lenders’ products without buyer consent. The judicial
climate in Mississippi is such that the outcome of these cases
is extremely unpredictable. We have been advised by legal
counsel that we have meritorious defenses to all claims being
asserted against us. We believe, based on information currently
available, that the amounts accrued for any losses are adequate.

One of our subsidiaries, American Reliable Insurance Company
(“ARIC”), participated in certain excess of loss
reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result,
reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance
risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a
portion of these risks to retrocessionaires. ARIC ceased
reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain risks
continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance
contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers
involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties
on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and
non-disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries
involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the
retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with
ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking
collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The
disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and
allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated
claims “spirals” devised to disproportionately pass
claims losses to higher-level reinsurance layers. Many of the
companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are
currently involved in negotiations, arbitrations and/or
litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires,
reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including
brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those
disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those
involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss



accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program
year were adequate. However, our exposure under the 1995 program
year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the
1996 and 1997 program years. While the majority of the
negotiations, arbitrations and/or litigations between the
multiple layers of reinsurers, ceding companies and
intermediaries are still ongoing, ARIC and an affiliated
company, Bankers Insurance Company Limited (BICL), did resolve
disputes with two of its reinsurers in the 1996 and 1997 program
years by means of a commutation agreement. As a result of the
settlement, the two affiliated reinsurers paid ARIC and BICL
$6 million and both parties agreed to release each other
from any past, present or future obligations of any kind.

We were notified on August 26, 2004 that one of our
employees is being investigated by the criminal division of the
IRS for responses he made to questions he was asked by the IRS
relating to an approximately $18 million tax reserve taken
by us in 1999. At this stage, it would be speculative to predict
the outcome of this investigation. However, it could result in a
fine assessed against the employee and the Company, negative
publicity for the Company or more serious sanctions.

We believe, based on information currently available, that the
amounts accrued for currently outstanding disputes are adequate.
The inherent uncertainty of arbitrations and lawsuits, including
the uncertainty of estimating whether any settlements we may
enter into in the future, would be on favorable terms, makes it
difficult to predict the outcomes with certainty.

As a result of regulatory scrutiny of our industry practices or
our businesses, such as examinations of race-based premiums
charged in the past by two of our acquired subsidiaries, it is
possible that we may be subject to legal proceedings in the
future relating to those practices and businesses. See
“Item 1 — Business —
Regulation.”

See “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risk Factors.”

On February 9, 2005 we announced that our board of
directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per
common shares payable on March 14, 2005 to shareholders of
record as of February 28, 2005. We paid dividends of
$0.07 per share of common stock on June 8, 2004,
September 7, 2004 and December 7, 2004. Any
determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion
of our board of directors and will be dependent upon: our
subsidiaries’ payment of dividends and/or other statutorily
permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash
flows; our financial position and capital requirements; general
business conditions; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual
restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors
our board of directors deems relevant.

We are a holding company and, therefore, our ability to pay
dividends, service our debt and meet our other obligations
depends primarily on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries
to pay dividends and make other statutorily permissible payments
to us. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant
regulatory and contractual restrictions limiting their ability
to declare and pay dividends. See “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Risk Factors —
Risks Relating to Our Company — The inability of our
subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could
harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay future
stockholder dividends.” For the calendar year 2005, the
maximum amount of dividends that our subsidiaries could pay to
us under applicable laws and regulations without prior
regulatory approval is approximately $364 million.
Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $361.7 million
through December 31, 2004.

We may seek approval of regulators to pay dividends in excess of
any amounts that would be permitted without such approval.
However, there can be no assurance that we would seek such
approval or would obtain such approval.

In addition, payments of dividends on the shares of common stock
are subject to the preferential rights of preferred stock that
our board of directors may create from time to time. For more
information regarding restrictions on the payment of dividends
by us and our insurance subsidiaries, including pursuant to the
terms



of our revolving credit facilities, see
“Item 1 — Business —
Regulation — United States — State
Regulation — Insurance Regulation Concerning
Dividends and — SAP” and
“Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources.

”

In addition, our $500 million senior revolving credit
facility restricts payments of dividends in the event that an
event of default under the facility has occurred or a proposed
dividend payment would cause an event of default under the
facility.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which
appear elsewhere in this report. It contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see
“Forward-Looking Statements” for more information. Our
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,
including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report,
particularly under the headings “— Risk Factors”
and “Forward-Looking Statements.”

General

We pursue a differentiated strategy of building leading
positions in specialized market segments for insurance products
and related services in North America and selected other
markets. We provide: creditor-placed homeowners insurance;
manufactured housing homeowners insurance; debt protection
administration; credit insurance; warranties and extended
service contracts; individual health and small employer group
health



insurance; group dental insurance; group disability insurance;
group life insurance and pre-funded funeral insurance.

The markets we target are generally complex, have a relatively
limited number of competitors and, we believe, offer attractive
profit opportunities.

We report our results through five segments: Assurant Solutions,
Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits, Assurant PreNeed
and Corporate and Other. The Corporate and Other segment
includes activities of the holding company, financing expenses,
net realized gains (losses) on investments, interest income
earned from short-term investments held and interest income from
excess surplus of insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other
segments. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the
amortization of deferred gains associated with the portions of
the sales of FFG and LTC. FFG and LTC were sold through
reinsurance agreements as described below.

Critical Factors Affecting Results

Our profitability depends on the adequacy of our product
pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for
the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits
and claims, returns on invested assets and our ability to manage
our expenses. As such, factors affecting these items may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial condition.

Revenues

We derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance
policies and, to a lesser extent, fee income by providing
administrative services to certain clients. Sales of insurance
policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while
sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income.
In late 2000, the majority of our credit insurance clients began
a transition from the purchase of our credit insurance products
from which we earned premium revenue to debt protection
administration programs, from which we earn fee income. Debt
protection administration programs include services for
non-insurance products that cancel or defer the required monthly
payment on outstanding loans when covered events occur.

Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from
our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest
payments, dividends and sales of investments. Our investment
portfolio is currently primarily invested in fixed maturity
securities. Both investment income and realized capital gains on
these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in
interest rates.

Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create
unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly
sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary
policies, domestic and international economic and political
conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in
interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of,
fixed maturity and short-term investments.

The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our
portfolio and the investment income from these securities
fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions.
The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an
inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while
net investment income realized by us from future investments in
fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decease
with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income
and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk,
such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may
differ from those anticipated at time of investment as a result
of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining interest
rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and
bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid
or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates,
and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower
interest-bearing investments.

In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life
insurance policies with increasing death benefits. As of
December 31, 2004, approximately 83% of Assurant
PreNeed’s in force insurance policy reserves relate to
policies that provide for death benefit growth that is either
pegged to changes in the CPI or determined periodically at the
discretion of the Company. In extended periods of declining
interest rates or high inflation, there may be compression in
the spread between Assurant PreNeed’s death benefit growth
rates



and its investment earnings. As a result, declining interest
rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and our overall financial condition.

Expenses

Our expenses primarily consist of policyholder benefits,
underwriting, general and administrative expenses, and
distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses consist primarily of
commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of
deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and value of
businesses acquired (“VOBA”) and general operating
expenses. For a description of DAC and VOBA, see Notes 2,
19 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this report.

Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting
benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental
costs. It also depends on our ability to manage future benefit
and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria,
utilization review or claims management and, in health and
dental insurance, negotiation of favorable provider contracts.
Changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the
economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also
materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs.
As a result of one or more of these factors or other factors,
claims could substantially exceed our expectations, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

In 2004, we granted approximately 3.9 million stock
appreciation rights to our employees and directors. For every
dollar by which our stock price exceeds $22.00, we will
recognize an expense of approximately $3 million.

At December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2004, we had
$1,970 million and $996 million, respectively of debt
and preferred stock. This has had an impact on our annual
interest and dividend costs.

We will need to comply with certification requirements under
Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act as of
December 31, 2005, and we expect to incur increased
expenses to comply with these requirements.

Regulation

Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the
regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we
are able to do business may significantly harm our business or
results of operations in the future. For example, some states
have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested
covered claims and require health care and dental service plans
to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within
the required time period. Some states have also granted their
insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose
monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental
plans engaging in certain “unfair payment practices.”
If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these
requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may
materially adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, in some of our businesses,
such as individual medical products, our revenues and net income
will be affected by our ability to get regulatory approval for
rate increases. Where rate increases are unacceptable to us, we
could withdraw from a state but may for a limited period of time
be required to participate in state sponsored risk pools for our
former insureds who cannot get replacement policies.

For other factors affecting our results of operations or
financial condition, see “— Risk Factors.”

Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses

Our results of operations were affected by the following
material dispositions, including:

On May 3, 2004, we sold the assets of our WorkAbility
division of CORE, Inc. (“CORE”). We recorded a pre-tax
loss on the sale of $9 million, which was included in the
Corporate and Other segment.



On June 28, 2002, we sold our 50% ownership in Neighborhood
    Health Partnership (“NHP”) to NHP Holding LLC. We
    recorded pre-tax gains on sale of $11 million, which was
    included in the Corporate and Other segment.

Critical Accounting Estimates

There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be
critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent
in the application of those policies. In calculating financial
statement estimates, the use of different assumptions could
produce materially different estimates. In addition, if factors
such as those described above or in “— Risk
Factors” cause actual events to differ from the assumptions
used in applying the accounting policies and calculating
financial estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require
significant estimates which, if such estimates are not
materially correct, could affect the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements. Also, see
“— Reserves” for the sensitivity analysis of
our significant critical accounting estimates.

Premiums

Short Duration Contracts

Our short duration contracts are those on which we recognize
revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract term. Our short
duration contracts primarily include: group term life, group
disability, group medical and group dental, property and
warranty, credit life and disability and extended service
contracts and individual medical contracts issued after 2002 in
most jurisdictions.

Long Duration Contracts

Currently, our long duration contracts being sold are pre-funded
funeral life insurance and investment-type annuities. For
pre-funded funeral life insurance policies, any excess of the
gross premium over the net premium is deferred and is recognized
in income in a constant relationship with the insurance in
force. For pre-funded funeral investment-type annuity contracts,
revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances.

For individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 and
currently in a limited number of jurisdictions and traditional
life insurance contracts sold by Assurant PreNeed that are no
longer offered, revenue is recognized when due from
policyholders.

For universal life insurance and investment-type annuity
contracts sold by Assurant Solutions that are no longer offered,
revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances.

Premiums for LTC insurance and traditional life insurance
contracts within FFG are recognized as revenue when due from the
policyholder. For universal life insurance and investment-type
annuity contracts within FFG, revenues consist of charges
assessed against policy balances. For the FFG and LTC businesses
previously sold, all revenue is ceded to The Hartford and John
Hancock, respectively.

Reinsurance Assumed

Reinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based upon payments
received from ceding companies together with accrual estimates
which are based on both payments received and in force policy
information received from ceding companies. Any subsequent
differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period
in which they are determined.

Fee Income

We primarily derive income from fees received from providing
administration services. Fee income is earned when services are
performed.



Reserves

Reserves are established according to GAAP, using generally
accepted actuarial methods and are based on a number of factors.
These factors include experience derived from historical claim
payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development
factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the
incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims
have been reported and internal claims processing charges. The
process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly
for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent
upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of
legal liability and damage awards. The methods of making such
estimates and establishing the related liabilities are
periodically reviewed and updated.

Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or SAP, do not represent
an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best
estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given
time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and
administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on
our assessment of facts and circumstances then known. The
adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims
severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other
factors. These variables are affected by both external and
internal events, such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes
in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical
perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of
disability, emerging health issues and new methods of treatment
or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative
changes and claims handling procedures.

Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly
on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as
experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and
negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the
period in which such estimates are updated. Because
establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process
involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty
that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves.
Future loss development could require reserves to be increased,
which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in
the periods in which such increases are made.

Short Duration Contracts

For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable
reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability
is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims.
The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case
reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet
date; (2) incurred but not reported (“IBNR”)
reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has
not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and
(3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected
handling costs of settling the claims.

For group disability, the case reserves and the IBNR are
recorded at an amount equal to the net present value of the
expected claims future payments. Group long-term disability and
group term life waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the
valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation
interest rate is reviewed quarterly by taking into consideration
actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with
adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse
deviation. Group long term disability and group term life
reserve adequacy studies are performed annually, and morbidity
and mortality assumptions are adjusted where appropriate.

Unearned premium reserves are maintained for the portion of the
premiums on short duration contracts that is related to the
unexpired period of the policy.

We have exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general
liability claims arising from our participation in various
reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1983. This exposure arose
from a short duration contract that we discontinued writing many
years ago. We carried case reserves for these liabilities as
recommended by the various pool managers and bulk reserves for
IBNR of $50 million (before reinsurance) and
$38.9 million (after reinsurance) in the aggregate at
December 31, 2004. Any estimation of these liabilities is
subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to
the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays
and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for
those exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal
issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and



what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination
of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to
financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. However,
based on information currently available, and after
consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial
statements, we believe that any changes in reserve estimates for
these claims are not reasonably likely to be material. Asbestos,
environmental and other general liability claim payments, net of
reinsurance recoveries, were $2.3 million,
$2.9 million and $1.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

One of our subsidiaries, ARIC, participated in certain excess of
loss reinsurance programs in the London market and, as a result,
reinsured certain personal accident, ransom and kidnap insurance
risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign affiliate ceded a
portion of these risks to other reinsurers (retrocessionaires).
ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in 1997. However, certain
risks continued beyond 1997 due to the nature of the reinsurance
contracts written. ARIC and some of the other reinsurers
involved in the programs are seeking to avoid certain treaties
on various grounds, including material misrepresentation and
non-disclosure by the ceding companies and intermediaries
involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the
retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with
ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking
collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The
disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and
allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated
claims “spirals” devised to disproportionately pass
claims losses to higher-level reinsurance layers. Many of the
companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are
currently involved in negotiations, arbitrations and/or
litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires,
reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including
brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those
disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those
involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss
accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program
year were adequate. However, our exposure under the 1995 program
year was less significant than the exposure remaining under the
1996 and 1997 program years. While the majority of the
negotiations, arbitrations and/or litigations between the
multiple layers of reinsurers, ceding companies and
intermediaries are still ongoing, ARIC and an affiliated
company, BICL did resolve disputes with two of its reinsurers in
the 1996 and 1997 program years by means of a commutation
agreement. As a result of the settlement, the two affiliated
reinsurers paid ARIC and BICL $6 million and both parties
agreed to release each other from any past, present or future
obligations of any kind.

Based on information currently available, and after
consideration of the reserves reflected in the financial
statements, we believe that it is not reasonably likely that any
liabilities we experience in connection with these programs
would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations. However, the inherent uncertainty of
arbitrations and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of
estimating whether any settlements we may enter into in the
future would be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to
predict the outcomes with certainty.

Long Duration Contracts

Future policy benefits and expense reserves on LTC, life
insurance policies and annuity contracts that are no longer
offered, individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003 or
issued in a limited number of jurisdictions and the traditional
life insurance contracts within FFG are recorded at the present
value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related
expenses less the present value of the future net premiums.
These amounts are estimated and include assumptions as to the
expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity and
withdrawal rates as well as other assumptions that are based on
our experience. These assumptions reflect anticipated trends and
include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations.

Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre-funded
funeral investment-type annuities, universal life insurance
policies and investment-type annuity contracts that are no
longer offered, and the variable life insurance and
investment-type annuity contracts in FFG consist of policy
account balances before applicable surrender charges and certain
deferred policy initiation fees that are being recognized in
income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged
to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of
policy account balances and interest credited to policy account
balances.



Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre-funded
funeral life insurance contracts are recorded as the present
value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses
less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve
assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected
investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates.
These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company
experience and include provision for possible unfavorable
deviation. An unearned revenue reserve is also recorded for
these contracts which represents the balance of the excess of
gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized
in future years’ income in a constant relationship to
insurance in force.

DAC

The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are
primarily related to the production of new business have been
deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable
from future premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs
primarily consist of commissions, policy issuance expenses,
premium tax and certain direct marketing expenses.

Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed
quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate
assumptions including the anticipation of interest income to
determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to
recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To
the extent a premium deficiency exists, it is recognized
immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a
corresponding reduction in DAC. If the premium deficiency is
greater than unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for
the excess deficiency.

Short Duration Contracts

DAC relating to property contracts, warranty and extended
service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts
are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to
premiums earned.

Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance
business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are
deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms and
balances of the underlying contracts.

Acquisition costs relating to group term life, group disability
and group dental consist primarily of new business underwriting,
field sales support, commissions to agents and brokers, and
compensation to sales representatives. These acquisition costs
are front-end loaded; thus they are deferred and amortized over
the estimated terms of the underlying contracts.

Acquisition costs on individual medical contracts issued in most
jurisdictions after 2002 and small group medical contracts
consist primarily of commissions to agents and brokers and
compensation to representatives. These contracts are considered
short duration because the terms of the contract are not fixed
at issue and they are not guaranteed renewable. As a result,
these costs are not deferred but rather are recorded in the
statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred.

Long Duration Contracts

Acquisition costs for pre-funded funeral life insurance policies
and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and
amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the
premium-paying period.

For pre-funded funeral investment-type annuities and universal
life insurance policies and investment-type annuity contracts
that are no longer offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to
the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from
investment, mortality, expense margins and surrender charges
over the estimated life of the policy or contract. The
assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those
used in computing the policy or contract liabilities.

Acquisition costs relating to individual medical contracts
issued prior to 2003 and in a limited numbers of juridictions
are deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms of
the underlying contracts. These acquisition costs relate to
commissions and policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent
the majority of deferred costs and result from commission
schedules that pay significantly higher rates in the first year.
The



majority of deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of
separately underwriting each individual medical contract.

Acquisition costs on the FFG and LTC disposed businesses were
written off when the businesses were sold.

Investments

We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that
investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are
identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any
impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period.
Our methodology to identify potential impairments requires
professional judgment.

Changes in individual security values are regularly monitored in
order to identify potential problem credits. In addition,
pursuant to our impairment process, each month the portfolio
holdings are screened for securities whose market price is equal
to 85% or less of their original purchase price. Management then
makes their assessment as to which of these securities are other
than temporarily impaired. Assessment factors include, but are
not limited to, the financial condition and rating of the
issuer, any collateral held and the length of time the market
value of the security has been below cost. Each quarter the
watchlist is discussed at a meeting attended by members of our
investment, accounting and finance departments. At this meeting,
any security whose price decrease is deemed to have been other
than temporarily impaired is written down to its then current
market level, with the amount of the writedown reflected in our
statement of operations for that quarter. Previously impaired
issues are also monitored monthly, with additional writedowns
taken quarterly if necessary.

Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making
these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical
assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced
economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more
companies, industry sectors or countries could result in
additional writedowns in future periods for impairments that are
deemed to be other-than-temporary. See also
“Investments” in Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report.

Reinsurance

Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid
benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and
contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder
contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over
the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions
consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts
recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent
with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future
policy benefits reserves and are reported in our consolidated
balance sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge our
primary liability to our insureds. An estimated allowance for
doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic
evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency,
management’s experience and current economic conditions.

Other Accounting Policies

For a description of other accounting policies applicable to the
periods covered by this report, see Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
report.

Significant Accounting Standard Affecting Our
    Business

On January 1, 2002, we adopted FAS 142. As of our
adoption of FAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill. In
addition, we were required to subject our goodwill to an initial
impairment test. As a result of FAS 142, we are required to
conduct impairment testing on an annual basis and between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change indicating a
possible goodwill impairment. In the absence of an impairment
event, our net income will be higher as a result of not having
to amortize goodwill.

As a result of this initial impairment test, we recognized a
non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,261 million. The
impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting



principle as of January 1, 2002. The impairment charge had
no impact on cash flows or the statutory-basis capital and
surplus of our insurance subsidiaries. We performed a
January 1, 2003 and 2004 impairment test during the six
months ended June 30, 2003 and 2004 and concluded that
goodwill was not further impaired. We also performed a
January 1, 2005 impairment test during the three months
ended March 31, 2005 and management believes that goodwill
will not be impaired.

See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this report for a description of additional recent
accounting standards that are applicable to us.

Results of Operations

Consolidated Overview

The table below presents information regarding our consolidated
results of operations:

(1)

Includes amortization of DAC and VOBA and underwriting, general
    and administrative expenses.

Note:

The table above includes the cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle in 2002. These items are only included in
    this Consolidated Overview. As a result, the tables presented
    under the segment discussions do not total to the same amounts
    shown on this consolidated overview table. See Note 21 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
    elsewhere in this report.



Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to
    December 31, 2003

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $338 million, or 5%, from
$7,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
to $7,404 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by
$326 million, or 5%, from $6,157 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $6,483 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase
of $87 million and $222 million in Assurant Solutions
and Assurant Health, respectively. The increase in Assurant
Solutions was primarily due to growth in the extended service
contract, international, and creditor placed and voluntary
homeowners businesses. This growth was offset by a decline in
domestic credit insurance and our manufactured housing
businesses. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to
increased sales, which partially reflect the success of HSAs,
and increased rates.

Net investment income increased by $28 million, or 5%, from
$607 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$635 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
average portfolio yield decreased 16 basis points from
5.61% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 5.45% for the
year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in the average
portfolio yield was due to the lower interest rate environment.
The average invested assets increased by approximately 8% for
the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Net realized gains on investments improved by $22 million,
or over 100%, from net realized gains of $2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003, to net realized gains of
$24 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net
realized gains on investments are comprised of both
other-than-temporary impairments and realized gains (losses) on
sales of securities. For the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2004, we had other-than-temporary impairments on fixed
maturity and equity securities of $20 million and
$0.6 million, respectively. The Company also recorded
realized losses of $11 million and $4.2 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively,
related to other investments. There were no individual
impairments in excess of $10 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2004.

Amortization of deferred gains on disposal of businesses
decreased by $10 million, or 15%, from $68 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003, to $58 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was
consistent with the anticipated run-off of the business ceded to
The Hartford in 2001 and John Hancock in 2000. See
“Reinsurance.”

On May 3, 2004 we sold our WorkAbility division and
recorded a $9 million loss on disposal of this business in
the second quarter of 2004.

Fees and other income decreased by $19 million, or 8%, from
$232 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$213 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
decrease was primarily due to decreases of $25 million and
$9 million in Assurant Employee Benefits and Corporate and
Other, respectively, offset by increases of $7 million and
$6 million in Assurant Solutions and in Assurant Health,
respectively. The decrease in Assurant Employee Benefits was
primarily driven by lower fee income resulting from the sale of
the WorkAbility division. The decrease in Corporate and Other
was due to a one-time adjustment recorded in third quarter of
2003. The increase in Assurant Solutions was primarily due to an
increase in fees related to growth in extended service contracts
and debt deferment businesses. The increase in Assurant Health
was primarily due to additional insurance policy fees and higher
fee-based product sales in individual markets.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$62 million, or 1%, from $6,806 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $6,868 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

Policyholder benefits increased by $182 million, or 5%,
from $3,658 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, to $3,840 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to
increases of $37 million, $106 million and
$29 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and
Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively. The increase in
Assurant Solutions was primarily due to higher catastrophe



losses, net of reinsurance, in 2004 from Hurricanes Charley,
Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. We incurred losses from catastrophes,
net of reinsurance, of $93 million and $30 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
This was partially offset by improved loss experience in our
specialty property business absent the catastrophes. The
increase in Assurant Health was consistent with the increase in
net earned premiums and other considerations. The increase in
Assurant Employee Benefits was primarily due to a reserve
reduction in 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, we
completed actuarial reserve adequacy studies for the group
disability, group life and group dental products, which
reflected that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant
by $18 million. Therefore, we reduced reserves by
$18 million in the third quarter of 2003 to reflect these
estimates.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$142 million, or 5%, from $2,828 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $2,970 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily
due to increases of $61 million, $86 million,
$10 million and $8 million in Assurant Solutions,
Assurant Health, Assurant PreNeed and Corporate and Other,
respectively, offset by a decrease in Assurant Employee Benefits
of $23 million. The increase in Assurant Solutions was
primarily due to an increase in extended service contract,
international and creditor-placed homeowners businesses and
Sarbanes-Oxley related expenses. The increase in Assurant Health
was primarily due to increased commission expense associated
with our individual health businesses. The decrease in Assurant
Employee Benefits was primarily due to the sale of the
WorkAbility division. The increase in Assurant PreNeed was
primarily due to higher amortized commissions and expenses
incurred as a result of the change in mix of business to more
single-pay sales. The increase in Corporate and Other was
primarily due to public company costs, including expenses
related to our initial and secondary public stock offerings and
additional costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley.

Interest expense increased by $55 million from
$1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$56 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
increase was the result of two senior notes that we issued in
February 2004. See “— Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

Distributions on preferred securities decreased by
$111 million, or 98%, from $113 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to $2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The decline was due to the early
redemption of $1,250 million of preferred securities in
December 2003 and $196 million of preferred securities in
January 2004.

In 2003, we incurred a $206 million interest charge due to
the early redemption of $1,446 million of preferred
securities.

Net Income

Net income increased by $165 million, or 89%, from
$186 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$351 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Income taxes increased by $111 million, or 150%, from
$74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$185 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
28.5% compared to 34.5% for the year ended December 31,
2004. In December 2004, pursuant to the American Jobs Creation
Act (“Jobs Act”), we repatriated $110 million of
capital from our Puerto Rico subsidiary and incurred
approximately $19 million of tax expense. In accordance
with proposed legislation, we anticipate that approximately
$5 million of this expense will be recaptured as a tax
benefit when the proposed legislation becomes enacted. In
addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004, an analysis of our
Federal Tax Liability resulted in a $10 million reduction
of our tax liability.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to
    December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $534 million, or 8%, from
$6,532 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $7,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.



Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by
$476 million, or 8%, from $5,681 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $6,157 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net earned
premiums and other considerations was primarily due to increases
of $285 million, $175 million, and $23 million in
Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, and Assurant Employee
Benefits, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of
$8 million in Assurant PreNeed. The increase in Assurant
Solutions was due to growth in specialty property and consumer
protection products. The increase in Assurant Health was
primarily due to increases in individual health insurance
business due to membership growth and premium rate increases.

Net investment income decreased by $25 million, or 4%, from
$632 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$607 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment yields
driven by the lower interest rate environment. The yield on
average invested assets was 5.61% for the year ended
December 31, 2003, as compared to 6.27% for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by
$120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of
$118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Net realized gains (losses) on
investments are comprised of both other-than-temporary
impairments and realized capital gains (losses) on sales of
securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had
other-than-temporary impairments of $20 million as compared
to $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
There were no individual impairments in excess of
$10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Impairments on available for sale securities in excess of
$10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
consisted of an $18 million writedown of fixed maturity
investments in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed
maturity investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million
writedown of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom.
Excluding the effects of other-than-temporary impairments, we
recorded an increase in net realized gains of $55 million
in the Corporate and Other segment.

Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses
decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was
consistent with the run-off of the businesses ceded to The
Hartford and John Hancock. See
“— Reinsurance.”

Gain on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million, or
100%, from $11 million for the year ended December 31,
2002 to zero for the year ended December 31, 2003. There
were no disposals in 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our
investment in NHP, which resulted in pre-tax gains of
$11 million.

Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 6%, from
$246 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to
$232 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income
recognized in Corporate and Other segment for the year ended
December 31, 2002, associated with a settlement true-up of
a 1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and
reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of
receivables that had been previously written off.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$644 million, or 10%, from $6,162 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to $6,806 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits increased by $222 million, or 6%,
from $3,435 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $3,658 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to
increases of $144 million, $95 million and
$8 million in Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health and
Assurant PreNeed, respectively, with an offsetting decrease of
$24 million in Assurant Employee Benefits. The increase in
Assurant Solutions was primarily due to growth in specialty
property products, primarily in creditor-placed and voluntary
homeowners insurance lines of business. The increase in Assurant
Health was primarily due to the increase in individual health
insurance business, which was consistent with growth in this
business.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$220 million, or 8%, from $2,609 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $2,828 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was



primarily due to increases of $141 million,
$43 million and $11 million in Assurant Solutions,
Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, respectively.
The increase in Assurant Solutions was consistent with growth in
the specialty property and consumer protection products
business. The increase in Assurant Health was primarily due to
increases in commissions, amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and general expenses, which was consistent
with the growth in business.

Distributions on preferred securities decreased by
$5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to $113 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of
the preferred securities in mid-December 2003, resulting in
lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining $196 million of
preferred securities in early January 2004. As a result of the
early extinguishment of all the preferred securities, we
incurred $206 million in interest premiums on redemption
for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to zero in
2002.

Net Income

Net income increased by $1,187 million, or 119%, from a
loss of $1,001 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to a profit of $186 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
$260 million. When we adopted FAS 142 in 2002, we
recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
which resulted in an expense of $1,261 million in 2002 as
compared to zero recognized in 2003.

Income taxes decreased by $36 million, or 33%, from
$110 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
effective tax rate for 2003 was 28.5% compared to 29.7% in 2002.

Assurant Solutions

Overview

The table below presents information regarding Assurant
Solutions’ segment results of operations:



(1)

“Specialty Property Solutions” includes a variety of
    specialized property insurance programs that are coupled with
    differentiated administrative capabilities.

(2)

“Consumer Protection Solutions” includes an array of
    debt protection, administrative services, credit based programs
    and extended service contracts.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to
    December 31, 2003

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $92 million, or 3%, from
$2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$2,770 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by
$87 million, or 4% from $2,362 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to $2,449 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to
an increase of $51 million in net earned premiums and other
considerations from our consumer protection solutions products,
primarily due to growth in our extended service contract and
international businesses, partially offset by the decline of our
domestic credit insurance business. Net earned premiums and
other considerations from our specialty property solutions
products increased by $36 million, primarily from growth in
our creditor-placed and voluntary homeowners insurance product
lines. This growth was partially offset by lower net earned
premiums in our manufactured housing business, primarily due to
the overall decline in manufactured housing sales.

Net investment income decreased by $2 million, or 1%, from
$187 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$185 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
average portfolio yield decreased by 40 basis points from
5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 4.78% for
the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the lower interest
rate environment. The average invested assets increased by
approximately 7% for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to the year ended December 31, 2003.

Fees and other income increased by $7 million, or 5%, from
$129 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$136 million for the year ended December 31, 2004,
primarily due to an increase in fees related to growth in our
extended service contracts and our debt deferment businesses.
These increases were partially offset by two factors. The year
ended December 31, 2003 included fee income of
$6 million pertaining to certain non-profitable membership
programs that were discontinued in the latter part of 2003 and
in the first quarter of 2003 we recognized fees for a one-time
project.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$98 million, or 4%, from $2,489 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to $2,587 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Policyholder benefits increased by $37 million, or 4%, from
$899 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$936 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
increase was primarily attributable to higher catastrophe
losses, net of reinsurance, in 2004 from Hurricanes Charley,
Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. We incurred losses, net of
reinsurance, from catastrophes of $93 million and
$30 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The higher catastrophe losses in 2004 were
partially offset by improved loss experience, in our specialty
property business absent the catastrophes.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$61 million, or 4%, from $1,590 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to $1,651 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. Commissions, taxes, licenses and
fees, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased by
$15 million, which is consistent with the change in the mix
of business. General expenses increased by $46 million,
primarily due to increased business from our extended service
contracts, international, and creditor-placed homeowners
insurance businesses. Additionally, in 2004 we incurred
Sarbanes-Oxley related expenses and an increase in guaranty fund
assessments attributable to the four hurricanes.



Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax decreased by $7 million, or 5%,
from $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
to $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Income taxes increased by $1 million, or 2%, from
$56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$57 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
change in income taxes is consistent with the change in pretax
income and reflects a change in the mix of international and
domestic taxable income.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to
    December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $277 million, or 12%, from
$2,401 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $2,678 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by
$285 million, or 14%, from $2,077 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $2,362 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily
due to $181 million of additional net earned premiums and
other considerations attributable to our special property
products, primarily due to our creditor-placed and voluntary
homeowners insurance and manufactured housing homeowners
insurance lines of business generated from new clients and
increased sales growth from our existing clients. Consumer
protection products also contributed $104 million in net
earned premiums and other considerations primarily from growth
in our warranty and extended service contracts business.

Net investment income decreased by $18 million, or 9%, from
$205 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$187 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
average portfolio yield dropped 67 basis points from 5.85%
for the year ended December 31, 2002, to 5.18% for the year
ended December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate
environment. The average allocated invested assets increased by
approximately 3%.

Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 8%, from
$119 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$129 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
primarily due to the continuing transition of our credit
insurance business to our debt protection administration
business. We also recognized fees for a one time project in the
first quarter of 2003 of $2.9 million.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$285 million, or 13%, from $2,204 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $2,489 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits increased by $144 million, or 19%,
from $755 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $899 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. Our specialty property products accounted for
$112 million of the increase primarily due to growth in our
creditor-placed and voluntary homeowners insurance lines of
business and approximately $18 million of the increase was
attributable to various catastrophes ($30 million in 2003
compared to $12 million in 2002). Our consumer protection
products also contributed $32 million of the increase
primarily due to growth in our warranty and extended service
contracts line of business.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$141 million, or 10%, from $1,449 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $1,590 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Selling and underwriting
expenses, of which amortization of DAC is a component, increased
by $116 million, which consisted of $45 million
primarily from our specialty property products due to growth in
our creditor-placed and voluntary homeowners insurance and
manufactured housing insurance lines. Also, $71 million of
the increase was from our consumer protection products due to
increased growth in our warranty and extended service contract
lines of business. General expenses increased by
$25 million, primarily from start up costs related to
setting up new clients in the creditor-placed homeowners
insurance area and increased business from our warranty and
extended service contract products.



Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by $1 million, or 1%,
from $132 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, to $133 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. Excluding the decrease in investment income of
$13 million after-tax, segment income after tax increased
by $14 million, or 11%.

Income taxes decreased by $9 million, or 14%, from
$65 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This
decrease was mainly due to a decrease in pre-tax income and a
lower effective tax rate in 2003.

Assurant Health

Overview

The table below presents information regarding Assurant
Health’s segment results of operations:

(1)

The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net
    earned premiums and other considerations.

(2)

The expense ratio is equal to selling, underwriting and general
    expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations
    and fees and other income.

(3)

The combined ratio is equal to total benefits, losses and
    expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations
    and fees and other income.



Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to
    December 31, 2003

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $247 million, or 12%, from
$2,091 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
to $2,338 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by
$222 million, or 11%, from $2,009 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $2,231 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premium growth in
individual health insurance business was attributable to
continued sales which partially reflect the success of the HSAs
that were introduced on January 1, 2004, and premium rate
increases. Net earned premium growth in our small employer group
health insurance business was attributable to premium rate
increases partially offset by decreases in membership.

Net investment income increased by $19 million, or 39%,
from $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
The average portfolio yield decreased by 8 basis points
from 5.55% for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 5.47%
for the year ended December 31. 2004, due to the lower
interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased
by approximately 39% for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to the year ended December 31, 2003.

Fees and other income increased by $6 million, or 18%, from
$33 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$39 million for the year ended December 31, 2004,
primarily due to additional insurance policy fees and higher
fee-based product sales in individual markets, such as sales of
our non-insurance health access discount cards.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$192 million, or 10%, from $1,906 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $2,098 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

Policyholder benefits increased by $106 million, or 8%,
from $1,317 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, to $1,423 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The loss ratio improved 180 basis
points from 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
63.8% for the year ended December 31, 2004. This
improvement was attributable to favorable loss experience
predominantly on individual health insurance business, as well
as a higher mix of individual health insurance business compared
to small employer group health insurance business in 2004.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$86 million, or 15%, from $589 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $675 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The expense ratio increased by
80 basis points from 28.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 to 29.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2004. These increases were primarily related
to increased commission expense on first year individual health
insurance business and additional spending on initiatives to
improve our product offerings, distribution, customer service,
and infrastructure.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by $37 million, or 31%,
from $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
to $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Income taxes increased by $18 million, or 28%, from
$64 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$82 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This
increase was primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to
    December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $179 million, or 9.0%, from
$1,912 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $2,091 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.



Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by
$175 million, or 10%, from $1,834 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $2,009 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Net earned premiums
attributable to our individual health insurance business
increased $156 million due to membership growth and premium
rate increases. Net earned premiums attributable to our small
employer group health insurance business increased
$19 million primarily because we instituted premium rate
increases in select small group markets to sufficiently price
for the underlying medical costs of existing business and for
anticipated future medical trends.

Net investment income decreased by $6 million, or 11%, from
$55 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$49 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
There was a 88 basis point decrease in yield on the
investment portfolio from 6.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to 5.55% for the year ended
December 31, 2003, due to the lower interest rate
environment. Offsetting the decrease in yield was a 4% increase
in average invested assets for the year ended December 31,
2003, over the comparable prior year period.

Fees and other income increased by $10 million, or 43%,
from $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
due to additional insurance policy fees and higher fee-based
product sales in individual markets, such as sales of our
non-insurance health access discount cards.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$138 million, or 8%, from $1,768 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $1,906 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits increased by $95 million, or 8%, from
$1,222 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $1,317 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. This increase was consistent with the increase in net
earned premiums and other considerations. The loss ratio
improved 100 basis points from 66.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to 65.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2003, primarily due to our risk management
activities.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$43 million, or 8%, from $546 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $589 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Commissions increased by
$33 million corresponding to an increase in first year net
earned premiums over the prior year. Taxes, licenses and fees
decreased by $6 million due to reduced premium tax rates on
a portion of the medical premium. Amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs increased by $7 million due to
higher sales of individual health insurance products beginning
in 2000. General expenses increased by $9 million mainly
due to additional spending to improve claims experience. The
expense ratio improved 50 basis points from 29.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2002, to 28.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by $26 million, or 27%,
from $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Income taxes increased by $15 million, or 31%, from
$49 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$64 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
increase was consistent with the 27% increase in segment income
before income tax during the year ended December 31, 2003.



Assurant Employee Benefits

Overview

The table below presents information regarding Assurant Employee
Benefits’ segment results of operations:

(1)

The loss ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by net
    earned premiums and other considerations.

(2)

The expense ratio is equal to selling, underwriting and general
    expenses divided by net earned premiums and other considerations
    and fees and other income.

(3)

The premium persistency ratio is equal to the rate at which
    existing business for all issue years at the beginning of the
    period remains in force at the end of the period. The
    calculation for the year ended December 31, 2002 excludes
    DBD.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to
    December 31, 2003

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $6 million, or less than 1%,
from $1,450 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, to $1,456 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by
$21 million, or 2%, from $1,256 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $1,277 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. Net earned premium growth was
driven by our disability business. Group disability net earned
premiums increased by



$45 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was
primarily driven by an increase in business written through
alternate distribution sources, as well as the transition of a
block of business from administrative fee only business to fully
insured business. The increase in group disability net earned
premiums was partially offset by decreases in group dental and
group life net earned premiums and other considerations. Group
Dental net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by
$18 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to the comparable prior year period. We are maintaining
pricing discipline in an increasingly competitive market, which
has resulted in lower sales and renewals. Group life net earned
premiums decreased by $6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the comparable prior year
period. The decrease was due to the non-renewal of certain
unprofitable business during 2003. This resulted in an aggregate
premium persistency of 81.1% for 2004, an increase of
120 basis points from 2003.

Net investment income increased by $10 million, or 7%, from
$140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$150 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
average portfolio yield declined 17 basis points from 6.39%
for the year ended December 31, 2003, to 6.22% for the year
ended December 31, 2004, due to the lower interest rate
environment. The average invested assets increased by
approximately 10% for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to the year ended December, 2003.

Fees and other income decreased by $25 million, or 46%,
from $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
to $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
The decrease was primarily due to lower fee income resulting
from the sale of the WorkAbility division, as well as the
transition of a block of business from administrative fee only
business to fully insured business. See
“— Corporate and Other.”

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$6 million, or less than 1%, from $1,354 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003, to $1,360 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Policyholder benefits increased by $29 million, or 3%, from
$921 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$950 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
loss ratio increased by 110 basis points from 73.3% for the
year ended December 31, 2003 to 74.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2004. These year over year increases were
primarily driven by a reduction in reserves in 2003. During the
third quarter of 2003, we completed actuarial reserve adequacy
studies for group disability, group life, and group dental
products, which reflected that, in the aggregate, these reserves
were redundant by $18 million. Therefore, we reduced
reserves by $18 million in the third quarter of 2003 to
reflect these estimates. Also contributing to the increase in
2004 was poor experience on a single large disability case and
deterioration in group dental experience, partially offset by
lower group disability incidence and improved group life
mortality experience.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased by
$23 million or 5% from $433 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, to $410 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The expense ratio decreased by
170 basis points from 33.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2003, to 31.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by the
sale of the WorkAbility division noted earlier, as well as the
writedown of previously capitalized software in 2003, not
incurred in 2004.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2004 was $62 million.

Income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004
were $34 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues decreased by $5 million, less than 1%, from
$1,455 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $1,450 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.



Net earned premiums and other considerations increased by
$23 million, or 2%, from $1,233 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $1,256 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in disability
net earned premium of $61 million was primarily due to
additional disability reinsurance premiums assumed from DRMS.
Partially offsetting this increase was a $23 million
decrease in group life net earned premiums, due to the
non-renewal of certain unprofitable business and less new
business due to continued pricing discipline. In addition,
dental net earned premiums decreased by $15 million, driven
by lower sales and the non-renewal of a large account. This
resulted in an aggregate premium persistency of 79.9% for 2003,
which was unchanged from 2002.

Net investment income decreased by $8 million, or 5%, from
$148 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
There was a 77 basis point decrease in yield on the
investment portfolio from 7.16% for the year ended
December 31, 2002 to 6.39% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 due to the lower interest rate
environment. Average invested assets increased by 6% from 2002
to 2003.

Fees and other income decreased by $20 million, or 27%,
from $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The decrease was primarily due to lower fee revenue from CORE
due to the sale of PRA.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses, and expenses decreased by
$13 million, or 1%, from $1,367 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $1,354 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits decreased by $24 million, or 3%, from
$945 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$921 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
decrease was driven by favorable development in disability
claims and lower claim volume due to the reduction in dental and
group life net earned premiums. In addition, during the third
quarter of 2003, we completed reserve studies for the group
disability, group life, and group dental products, which
concluded that, in the aggregate, these reserves were redundant.
Adjustments were made to reserves to reflect current mortality
and morbidity experience. In addition, the reserve discount rate
on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low interest
rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments was a
reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million. The
benefits loss ratio improved from 76.6% in 2002 to 73.3% in
2003. Excluding the reserve release discussed above, the
benefits loss ratio improvement was driven primarily by
favorable disability experience.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$11 million, or 3%, from $422 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $433 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The expense ratio increased from
32.3% in 2002, to 33.1% in 2003, primarily due to a
$6.2 million writedown of previously capitalized software
related to our new administration system.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax increased by $5 million, or 9%,
from $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Income tax expense increased by $3 million, or 10%, from
$31 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to
$34 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
increase was consistent with the 9% increase in segment income
before tax.



Assurant PreNeed

Overview

The table below presents information regarding Assurant
PreNeed’s segment results of operations:

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to
    December 31, 2003

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $16 million, or 2%, from
$723 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$739 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by
$4 million, or less than 1%, from $530 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003, to $526 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily
due to a 3.6% decline in new sales as a result of our decision
to make pricing changes on certain new business as well as a
decrease in renewal premiums in the AMLIC channel. These were
partially offset by the change in the mix of business from
limited-pay to single-pay sales in the independent channel.

Net investment income increased by $18 million, or 10%,
from $188 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, to $206 million for the year ended December 31,
2004. The average portfolio yield decreased 23 basis points
from 6.57% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 6.34%
for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to the lower
interest rate environment. The average invested assets increased
by approximately 14% for the year ended December 31, 2004
from the year ended December 31, 2003.

Fees and other income increased by $2 million, or 40% from
$5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
primary reason for this increase is $1 million of income
related to a derivative instrument, the CPI cap.



Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$20 million, or 3%, from $668 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to $688 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Policyholder benefits increased by $10 million, or 2%, from
$521 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$531 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
increase was primarily due to a larger in force block of
business as well as an increase of $5 million over 2003
related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off
feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to
single-pay policies. These increases were partially offset by a
reduction in growth rates on the discretionary growth business
which reduced policyholder benefits by $5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$10 million, or 7%, from $147 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to $157 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to higher amortized
commissions and expenses incurred as a result of the change in
mix of business to more single-pay sales.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax decreased by $2 million, or 6%,
from $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
to $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Income taxes decreased by $2 million, or 11%, from
$19 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
decrease was primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to
    December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues decreased by $4 million, or 1%, from
$727 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$723 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Net earned premiums and other considerations decreased by
$8 million, or 2%, from $538 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $530 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to
a $10 million decline in our AMLIC channel which was caused
by a 24% drop in new face sales from SCI, AMLIC’s principal
customer.

Net investment income increased by $4 million, or 2%, from
$184 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$188 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. A
8% increase in average invested assets was offset by a
34 basis point decrease in the annualized investment yield,
which was 6.91% at December 31, 2002 compared to 6.57% at
December 31, 2003. The increase in average invested assets
was due to a larger in force block of business. The rate decline
reduced net investment income by $10 million over the
comparable prior year period. The decline in yields was due to
the lower interest rate environment and the restructuring of the
portfolio in 2002 to improve credit quality.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$18 million, or 3%, from $650 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $668 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Policyholder benefits increased by $8 million, or 2%, from
$513 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$521 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
This increase was due to the increase in business written and
other factors. A portion of our pre-funded funeral insurance
policies use a CPI rate credited on policies. The CPI rate
increased from 1.97% in 2002 to 2.40% in 2003. This increased
policyholder benefits by $2 million in 2003. In addition,
benefit expense increased $4 million over 2002 levels
related to higher customer utilization of an early pay off
feature that allows conversions from limited pay policies to
single-pay policies.



Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$10 million, or 7%, from $137 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $147 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Amortization of DAC and VOBA
expense increased $9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, principally due to a larger in force
block of business. Overall general operating expenses before
deferral of costs declined $2 million over the comparable
prior year period due to expense control. This reduction
includes a $0.7 million charge associated with
restructuring of the sales force in our independent division.
Non deferrable general operating expenses were even with the
prior year.

Segment Income After Tax

Segment income after tax decreased by $14 million, or 28%,
from $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
This decrease was caused primarily by smaller spreads between
investment income earned and the fixed benefits credited to
policyholders, increased growth credited on the CPI block of
business and higher utilization of the early pay off feature.

Income taxes decreased by $8 million, or 30%, from
$27 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$19 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
which was consistent with the 28% decrease in segment income
before tax.

Corporate and Other

Overview

The Corporate and Other segment includes activities of the
holding company, financing expenses, net realized gains (losses)
on investments, interest income earned from short-term
investments held and interest income from excess surplus of
insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other segments. The
Corporate and Other segment also includes the amortization of
deferred gains associated with the sales of the FFG and LTC
businesses.

The table below presents information regarding Corporate and
Other’s segment results of operations:



As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$330 million (pre-tax) of deferred gains that had not yet
been amortized. We expect to amortize deferred gains from
dispositions through 2031. The deferred gains are being
amortized in a pattern consistent with the expected future
reduction of the in force blocks of business ceded to The
Hartford and John Hancock. This reduction is expected to be more
rapid in the first few years after sale and to be slower as the
liabilities in the blocks decrease.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to
    December 31, 2003

Total Revenues

Total revenues decreased by $23 million, or 19%, from
$124 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$101 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net investment income decreased by $17 million, or 40%,
from $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
mainly due to the lower interest rate environment and the
decrease in average invested assets.

Net realized gains on investments improved by $22 million,
or over 100%, from net realized gains of $2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003, to net realized gains of
$24 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net
realized gains on investments are comprised of both
other-than-temporary impairments and realized gains (losses) on
sales of securities. For the year ended December 31, 2003
and 2004, we had other-than-temporary impairments on fixed
maturity and equity securities of $20 million and
$0.6 million, respectively. The Company also recorded
realized losses of $11 million and $4.2 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively,
related to other investments. There were no individual
impairments in excess of $10 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses
decreased by $10 million, or 15%, from $68 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003, to $58 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was
consistent with the anticipated run-off of the business ceded to
The Hartford in 2001 and John Hancock in 2000.

On May 3, 2004, we sold our WorkAbility division and
recorded a $9 million loss on disposal of business in the
second quarter of 2004.

Fees and other income decreased by $9 million, or 82%, from
$11 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
primarily due to a one-time adjustment recorded in the third
quarter of 2003.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased by
$254 million, or 65%, from $389 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $135 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$8 million, or 12%, from $69 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $77 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to
$25 million of public company costs in 2004, including
expenses related to our initial and secondary public stock
offerings and additional costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley. In
2003, we incurred $14 million of public company costs,
including expenses related to our initial public offering.

Interest expense increased by $55 million from
$1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to
$56 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
increase was the result of the two senior notes that we issued
in February 2004. See “— Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

Distributions on preferred securities decreased by
$111 million, or 98%, from $113 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to $2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The decline was due to the early
redemption of $1,250 million of preferred securities in
December 2003 and $196 million of preferred securities in
January 2004.



In 2003, we incurred a $206 million interest charge due to
the early redemption of $1,446 million of preferred
securities.

Segment Loss After Tax

Segment loss after income tax improved by $137 million, or
83%, from $166 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, to $29 million for the year ended December 31,
2004.

Income tax benefit decreased by $94 million, or 95%, from
an income tax benefit of $99 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, to an income tax benefit of
$5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
change in the income tax benefit was consistent with the change
in segment loss before income tax. Also, in December 2004,
pursuant to the Jobs Act, we repatriated $110 million of
capital from our Puerto Rico subsidiary and incurred
approximately $19 million of tax expense. In accordance
with proposed legislation, we anticipate that approximately
$5 million of this expense will be recaptured as a tax
benefit when the proposed legislation becomes enacted. In
addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004, an analysis of our
Federal Tax Liability resulted in a $10 million reduction
of our tax liability.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to
    December 31, 2002

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased by $86 million, or 226%, from
$38 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$124 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Net investment income increased by $3 million, or 8%, from
$40 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
$43 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Net realized gains (losses) on investments improved by
$120 million, or 102%, from net realized losses of
$118 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, to
net realized gains of $2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. In 2003, we had other than temporary
impairments of $20 million as compared to $85 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no
individual impairments of available for sale securities in
excess of $10 million in 2003. Impairments on available for
sale securities in excess of $10 million in 2002 consisted
of an $20 million writedown of fixed maturity investments
in NRG Energy, a $12 million writedown of fixed maturity
investments in AT&T Canada and an $11 million writedown
of fixed maturity investments in MCI WorldCom. Excluding the
effects of other-than-temporary impairments, we recorded an
increase in net realized gains of $55 million.

Amortization of deferred gain on disposal of businesses
decreased by $12 million, or 15%, from $80 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002, to $68 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was
consistent with the run-off of the businesses ceded to The
Hartford and John Hancock. See “— Reinsurance.”

Gains on disposal of businesses decreased by $11 million,
or 100%, from $11 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002, to zero for the year ended
December 31, 2003. On June 28, 2002, we sold our
investment in NHP, which resulted in pre-tax gains of
$11 million.

Fees and other income decreased by $14 million, or 56%,
from $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The decrease was primarily due to $15 million of income
recognized in 2002 associated with a settlement true-up of a
1999 sale of a small block of business to a third party and
reversal of bad debt allowances due to successful collection of
receivables that had been previously written off.

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased by
$216 million, or 125%, from $173 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $389 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003.



Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased by
$14 million, or 25%, from $55 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $69 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to
$14 million of consulting and compensation expenses
incurred in 2003, related to our initial public offering in
February 2004.

Distributions on preferred securities decreased by
$5 million, or 4%, from $118 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, to $113 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. We redeemed $1,250 million of
our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in mid-December
2003, resulting in lower expenses. We redeemed the remaining
$196 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
in January 2004. As a result of the early extinguishment of all
the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities we incurred
$206 million of interest premiums for the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to zero recognized in 2002.

Segment Loss After Tax

Segment loss after tax increased by $92 million, or 124%,
from $74 million in 2002 to $166 million in 2003. This
change was primarily due to the $206 million of interest
premiums incurred related to early extinguishment of mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities, partially offset by the
favorable $120 million change in net realized capital gains
(losses) on investments.

Income tax benefit increased by $38 million, or 62%, from
$61 million in 2002 to $99 million in 2003. The change
in the income tax benefit was consistent with the change in
segment loss before income tax. In 2002 we also recognized the
release of approximately $13 million of previously provided
tax accruals, which were no longer considered necessary based on
the resolution of certain domestic tax matters.

Investments

The following table shows the carrying value of our investments
by type of security as of the dates indicated:

Of our fixed maturity securities shown above, 67% and 70% (based
on total fair value) were invested in securities rated
“A” or better as of December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, respectively. As interest rates
increase, the market value of fixed maturity securities
decreases.



The following table provides the cumulative net unrealized gains
(pre-tax) on fixed maturity securities and equity securities as
of the dates indicated:

Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities decreased by
$1 million, or less than 1%, from December 31, 2003 to
December 31, 2004. Net unrealized gains on equity
securities decreased by $5 million, or 26%, from
December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2004. The decrease
in net unrealized gains was primarily due to the net effect of
the change in treasury yields. The 10-year treasury yield
decreased 3 basis points between December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2004 and the 5-year treasury yield increased
36 basis points between December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2004.

Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities increased by
$94 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2002 to
December 31, 2003. Net unrealized gains on equity
securities decreased by $12 million, or 171%, from
December 31, 2002, to December 31, 2003. The increase
in net unrealized gains was primarily due to the decline in
investment grade corporate securities yield spreads combined
with an increase in treasury yields. Spreads on investment grade
corporate securities fell by approximately 119 basis points
while yields on 10-year treasury securities increased by
44 basis points between December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2003.

We recorded $0.6 million, $20 million, and
$85.3 million of pre-tax realized losses in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, associated with other-than-temporary
declines in value of available for sale securities. We also
recorded $4.2 million, $11 million, and zero of
pre-tax realized losses in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
associated with other investments.

The investment category and duration of our gross unrealized
losses on fixed maturities and equity securities at
December 31, 2004 were as follows:



The total unrealized losses represent less than 1% of the
aggregate fair value of the related securities. Approximately
77% of these unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss
position for less than twelve months. The total unrealized
losses are comprised of 474 individual securities with 92% of
the individual securities having an unrealized loss of less than
$0.1 million. The total unrealized losses on securities
that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for longer
than six months but less than 12 months was approximately
$7.9 million, with no security with a book value of greater
than $1.0 million having a market value below 86% of book
value.

As part of our ongoing monitoring process, we regularly review
our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be
other than temporarily impaired are identified on a timely basis
and that any impairment is charged against earnings in the
proper period. We have reviewed these securities and concluded
that there were no additional other than temporary impairments
for the year ended December 31, 2004. Due to issuers’
continued satisfaction of the securities’ obligations in
accordance with their contractual terms and their continued
expectations to do so, as well as our evaluation of the
fundamentals of the issuers’ financial condition, we
believe that the prices of the securities in an unrealized loss
position as of December 31, 2004 in the sectors discussed
above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of the
prevailing level of interest rates at the time the securities
were purchased.

December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The main
contributing factor to these increases was growth in underlying
business.

Unearned premiums increased by $220 million, or 7%, from
December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and decreased
by $74 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2002 to
December 31, 2003. The main contributing factor to the
increase from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004
was new extended service contract business assumed in late 2003.
The decrease from December 31, 2002 to December 31,
2003 was primarily driven by the run-off of our domestic credit
insurance contracts, offset by growth in other short duration
contracts.

Claims and benefits payable increased by $143 million, or
4%, from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and by
$98 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2002 to
December 31, 2003. The main contributing factor to these
increases was growth in underlying business.



The following table provides reserve information by our major
lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003:

For a description of our reserving methodology, see Note 16
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this report.

Long Duration

The following discusses the reserving process for our major long
duration product line.

Reserves for future policy benefits are recorded as the present
value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses
less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve
assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected
investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates.
These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company
experience and include provision for possible unfavorable
deviation. An unearned revenue reserve is also recorded which
represents the balance of the excess of gross premiums over net
premiums that is still to be recognized in future years’
income in a constant relationship to insurance in force.

Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed
quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate
assumptions to determine if the net liability position (all
liabilities less DAC) exceeds the minimum liability needed. Any
premium deficiency would first be addressed by removing the
provision for adverse deviation. To the extent a premium
deficiency still remains, it would be recognized immediately by
a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding
reduction in DAC. Any additional deficiency would be recognized
as a premium deficiency reserve.

Historically, loss recognition testing has not resulted in an
adjustment to DAC or reserves. Such adjustments would occur only
if economic or mortality conditions significantly deteriorated.



Short Duration

For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable
reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability
is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims.
The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case
reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet
date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event
has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance
sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for
the expected handling costs of settling the claims.
Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments
to our case reserves and assumptions where necessary. Below are
further discussions on the reserving process for our major short
duration products.

Group Disability and Group Term Life

Case or claim reserves are set for active individual claims on
group disability policies and for disability waiver of premium
benefits on group term life policies. Assumptions considered in
setting such reserves include disabled life mortality and claim
termination rates (the rates at which disabled claimants come
off claim, either through recovery or death), claim management
practices, awards for social security and other benefit offsets
and yield rates earned on assets supporting the reserves. Group
long-term disability and group term life waiver of premium
reserves are discounted because the payment pattern and ultimate
cost are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis.

Factors considered when setting IBNR reserves include patterns
in elapsed time from claim incidence to claim reporting, and
elapsed time from claim reporting to claim payment.

Key sensitivities for group long-term disability claim reserves
include the discount rate and claim termination rates. If the
discount rate were reduced (or increased) by 100 basis
points, reserves at December 31, 2004 would be
approximately $50.0 million higher (or $47.7 million
lower). If claim termination rates were 10% lower (or higher)
than currently assumed, reserves at December 31, 2004 would
be approximately $33.9 million higher (or
$31.7 million lower).

The discount rate is also a key sensitivity for group term life
waiver of premium reserves. If the discount rate were reduced
(or increased) by 100 basis points, reserves at
December 31, 2004 would be approximately $12.0 million
higher (or $11.3 million lower).

As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, Group Disability incurred losses related to prior
years were approximately $12 million less, $53 million
more, and $3 million less than the reserves that were
previously estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Group Disability reserves are long
term in nature, and the reserves are estimated based on claims
incurred in several prior years. The Group Disability reserve
deficiency in 2003, and its related upward revision, reflects
the result of reserve adequacy studies concluded in the third
quarter of 2003. Based on results of those studies, reserves
were increased by $44 million, almost all of which was
attributable to a reduction in the discount rate to reflect
current yields on invested assets. The Group Disability reserve
redundancies in 2002 and 2004, which were less than 1% of
prior-year reserves, arose as a result of our actual claim
recovery rates exceeding those assumed in our beginning-of-year
case reserves, after taking into account an offset of one less
year of discounting reflected in the Company’s end-of-year
case reserves. The difference in actual versus best estimate
recovery rates reflects an experience gain, which is recognized
in the period the gain is realized.

As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, Group Term Life incurred losses related to prior
years were approximately $36 million, $93 million, and
$29 million less than the reserves that were previously
estimated for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. A significant portion of the Group Term Life
reserve is related to waiver of premium reserves for disabled
claimants. Group Term Life waiver of premium reserves are
long-term in nature, and the reserves are estimated based on
claims incurred in several prior years.

Group Term Life reserves were reduced in the third quarter of
2003 to reflect the results of reserve adequacy studies
conducted. Based on the results of those studies, reserves were
reduced by $59 million. The



change in estimate reflects an increase in the discount rate,
lower mortality rates and higher recovery rates. These changes
were made to reflect current yields on invested assets and
recent mortality and recovery experience. Another portion of the
Group Term Life reserve redundancies in all years described
above was caused by actual mortality rates being lower than
assumed in our beginning-of-year reserves and recovery rates
being higher than assumed in our beginning-of-year wavier of
premium reserves. The remaining redundancy was due to
shorter-than-expected lags between incurred claim dates and paid
claim dates. These adjustments were made to reflect current
yields on invested assets, and recent mortality and recovery
experience. These changes were offset by one less year of
discounting reflected in the Company’s end-of-year waiver
of premium reserves. The differences in actual versus best
estimate mortality, recovery and paid claim lag rates reflect
experience gains, which are recognized in the period the gains
emerge.

The conclusion of the 2003 reserve studies determined that, in
the aggregate, the reserves were redundant. The reserve discount
rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low
interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments
was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18 million,
which included $3 million of reserve release relating to
the group dental business.

Medical

IBNR reserves represent the largest component of reserves
estimated for claims and benefits payable in our Medical line of
business, and we use a number of methods in their estimation,
including the loss development method and the projected claim
method for recent claim periods. We use several methods in our
Medical line of business because of the limitations of relying
exclusively on a single method.

A key sensitivity is the loss development factors used. Loss
development factors selected take into consideration claims
processing levels, claims under case management, medical
inflation, seasonal effects, medical provider discounts and
product mix. A 1% reduction (or increase) to the loss
development factors for the most recent four months would result
in approximately $18 million higher (or $14 million
lower) reserves at December 31, 2004. Our historical claims
experience indicates that approximately 80% of medical claims
are paid within four months of the incurred date.

As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, actual losses incurred in our Medical business
related to prior years were $50 million, $58 million,
and $43 million less than previously estimated for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Due to the short-tail nature of this business, these
developments related to claims incurred in the preceding year
(i.e., in 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively). The redundancies in
our Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions
in our Medical reserve estimates, were caused by our claims
developing more favorably than expected. Our actual claims
experience reflected lower medical provider utilization and
lower medical inflation than assumed in our prior-year pricing
and reserving processes. The differences in actual versus best
estimate paid claim lag rates, medical provider utilization and
medical inflation reflect experience gains, which are recognized
in the period the gains emerge.

None of the changes in incurred claims from prior years in our
Medical line of business, and the related downward revisions in
our Medical estimated reserves, were attributable to any change
in our reserve methods or assumptions.

Property and Warranty

Our Property and Warranty line of business includes
creditor-placed homeowners, manufactured housing homeowners,
credit property, credit unemployment and warranty insurance and
some longer-tail coverages (e.g., asbestos, environmental, other
general liability and personal accident). Our Property and
Warranty loss reserves consist of case reserves and bulk
reserves. Bulk reserves consist of IBNR and development on case
reserves. The method we most often use in setting our Property
and Warranty bulk reserves is the loss development method. Under
this method, we estimate ultimate losses for each accident
period by multiplying the current cumulative losses by the
appropriate loss development factor. We then calculate the bulk
reserve as the difference between the estimate of ultimate
losses and the current case-incurred losses (paid losses plus



case reserves). We select loss development factors based on a
review of historical averages, and we consider recent trends and
business specific matters such as current claims payment
practices.

We may use other methods depending on data credibility and
product line. We use the estimates generated by the various
methods to establish a range of reasonable estimates. The best
estimate is selected from the middle to upper end of the third
quartile of the range of reasonable estimates.

As set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for the periods ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, actual losses incurred in our property and
warranty lines of business related to prior years were
$25 million less, $13 million less, and
$2 million more than previously estimated for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
Company’s property and warranty lines of business had a
small deficiency in 2002 which was largely attributable to a
shift in the mix of business away from the credit property and
unemployment product lines. In addition, an increase in the
claim frequency of unemployment contributed to additional
development on the small deficiency experienced in 2002. In
2003, unemployment claim frequencies stabilized, contributing to
a modest redundancy. In 2004, an improved economic environment
led to lower unemployment levels, which meant that loss payments
on existing claims as well as payments on new claims in our
credit unemployment lines, were not as high as would have been
expected. This, coupled with lower reserve levels as a result of
reduced premium writings in this line, lead to a redundancy.
These changes reflect experience gains and losses from actual
claim frequencies differing from best estimate claim
frequencies, and difference in actual versus best estimate paid
claim lag rates. Such gains and losses are recognized in the
periods they emerge.

Most of our credit insurance business is written on a
retrospective commission basis, which permits Assurant Solutions
to adjust commissions based on claims experience. Thus, any
adjustment to prior years’ incurred claims in this line of
business is largely offset by a change in contingent commissions
which is included in the selling, underwriting and general
expenses line in the results of operations.

businesses, such as the dispositions of FFG and LTC. The
reinsurance recoverables relating to these dispositions amounted
to $2,389 million, $2,410 million, and
$2,255 million at December 31, 2004, December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the
assumption and cession of reinsurance with non-affiliated
companies. The following table provides details of the

Based on our December 31, 2004 results, we anticipate that
we will receive approximately $34 million from reinsurers
in respect of the 2004 Florida hurricanes. Our benefits, losses
and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect
this anticipated recovery.

Loss Protection and Capital Management

As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we
purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our
various business segments, including significant individual or
catastrophic claims, and to free up capital to enable us to
write additional business.

For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes,
we closely monitor and manage the aggregate risk exposure by
geographic area, and we have entered into reinsurance treaties
to manage exposure to these types of events.

Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the
ceding insurer, we remain liable for policy claims if the
assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit this
risk, we have control procedures to evaluate the financial
condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of
credit risk to minimize this exposure. The selection of
reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency
and reliability and, to a lesser degree, diversification as well
as developing strong relationships with our reinsurers for the
sharing of risks.

Business Dispositions

We have used reinsurance to exit certain businesses, such as the
dispositions of FFG and LTC. Reinsurance was used in these cases
to facilitate the transactions because the businesses shared
legal entities with business segments that we retained. Assets
backing liabilities ceded relating to these businesses are held
in trusts, and the separate accounts relating to FFG are still
reflected in our balance sheet.

The reinsurance recoverable from The Hartford was
$1,507 million and $1,537 million as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The reinsurance
recoverable from John Hancock was $882 million and
$873 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. We would be responsible for administering this
business and funding policyholder liabilities in the event of a
default by reinsurers. In addition, under the reinsurance
agreement, The Hartford is obligated to contribute funds to
increase the value of the separate account assets relating to
modified guaranteed annuity business sold if such value declines
below the value of the associated liabilities. If The Hartford
fails to fulfill these obligations, we will be obligated to make
these payments.

Assurant Solutions Segment Client Risk and Profit
    Sharing

The Assurant Solutions segment writes business produced by its
clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial
institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to
insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow
significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and
profits on the underlying business.

A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions’ reinsurance
activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and
risk related to business generated by certain clients to the
clients’ captive insurance companies or to reinsurance
subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest.
Through these arrangements, our insurance subsidiaries share
some of the premiums and risk related to client-generated
business with these clients. When the reinsurance companies are
not authorized to do business in our insurance subsidiary’s
domiciliary state, our insurance subsidiary obtains collateral,
such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance
company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding
reserves to obtain full financial credit in the domiciliary
state for the reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements do not
relieve us from our direct obligation to our insured. Thus, a
credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is
unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance
agreements. To minimize our exposure to reinsurance
insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of our
reinsurers and hold substantial collateral (in the form



of funds, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the
reinsurance agreements. See “Item 7A —
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk — Credit Risk.”

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Assurant, Inc. is a holding company, and as such, has limited
direct operations of its own. Our holding company assets consist
primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly,
our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends
and other statutorily permissible payments from our
subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation
agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries.
The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other
payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of
the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which
subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions.
The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to
state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable
subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other
things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency
requirements and limit the amount of dividends these
subsidiaries can pay to the holding company. Solvency
regulations, capital requirements and rating agencies are some
of the factors used in determining the amount of capital used
for dividends. For 2004, the maximum amount of distributions our
subsidiaries could pay under applicable laws and regulations
without prior regulatory approval was $302 million. For a
discussion of the various restrictions on the ability of our
subsidiaries to pay dividends, please see
“Item 1 — Business —
Regulation” and “Item 5 — Market for
Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Dividend
Policy.”

Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled $361.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004, $99.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003, and
$186.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
We used these cash inflows primarily to pay expenses, to make
interest payments on indebtedness and to make dividend payments
to our stockholders.

The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of
premiums and fees collected, the proceeds from the sales and
maturity of investments and investment income. Cash is primarily
used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating
expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries’
excess funds in order to generate income.

In December 2003, we entered into two senior bridge credit
facilities of $650 million and $1,100 million. The
aggregate indebtedness of $1,750 million under the facility
was in connection with the extinguishment of our mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities.

On January 30, 2004, we entered into a $500 million
senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks
arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (successor by
merger to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global
Markets, Inc., which is available for working capital and other
general corporate purposes. The revolving credit facility is
unsecured and is available until February 2007, so long as we
are not in default.

The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants.
The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that we
maintain certain specified minimum ratios or thresholds. As of
December 31, 2004, we are in compliance with all covenants
and we maintain all specified minimum ratios and thresholds.

On February 10, 2004, we received a $725.5 million
capital contribution from Fortis simultaneously with the closing
of our initial public offering. The proceeds from that
contribution were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness
under the $650 million senior bridge credit facility and
$75.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under the
$1,100 million senior bridge credit facility. In addition,
we repaid a portion of the $1,100 million senior bridge
credit facility with $49.5 million in cash. We also
refinanced the remaining amount outstanding under the
$1,100 million senior bridge credit facility with the
proceeds of our $975 million senior note offerings
described below. All amounts outstanding under our senior bridge
credit facilities were paid off in 2004.

On February 18, 2004, we issued two series of senior notes
in an aggregate principal amount of $975 million. The first
series is $500 million in principal amount, bears interest
at 5.625% per year and is



payable in a single installment due February 15, 2014. The
second series is $475 million in principal amount, bears
interest at 6.750% per year and is payable in a single
installment due February 15, 2034.

In March 2004, we established a $500 million commercial
paper program, which is available for working capital and other
general corporate purposes. Our subsidiaries do not maintain
commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at their level.
This program is backed up by a $500 million senior
revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (successor by merger to Banc
One Capital Markets, Inc.) and Citigroup Global Market, Inc.,
which was established on January 30, 2004. The revolving
credit facility is unsecured and is available until February
2007, so long as we are in compliance with all the covenants.
This facility is also available for general corporate purposes,
but to the extent used thereto, would be unavailable to back up
the commercial paper program. On June 1, 2004,
August 9, 2004 and October 18, 2004, we used
$20 million, $40 million and $40 million,
respectively, from the commercial paper program for general
corporate purposes, which was repaid on June 15, 2004,
August 20, 2004 and October 29, 2004, respectively.
There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program
outstanding at December 31, 2004. We did not use the
revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 and no amounts are currently outstanding.

Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually on
February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing
August 15, 2004. The senior notes are our unsecured
obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior
unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are not redeemable
prior to maturity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the
senior notes were used to repay the remaining portion of our
outstanding indebtedness under our $1,100 million senior
bridge facility.

Our qualified pension plan was under-funded by
$57.4 million at December 31, 2004. We established a
funding policy in which service cost plus 15% of plan deficit
will be contributed annually. In the full year 2004, we made
contributions to the pension fund totaling $26 million.
This funding policy will be revised annually to take into effect
any assumption changes, return on plan assets and funded status
of the plan. In accordance with ERISA, there is no expected
minimum funding requirement for 2004 or 2005. Our nonqualified
plan, which is unfunded, had a projected benefit obligation of
$85.2 million at December 31, 2004. The expected
Company payments to retirees under this plan are approximately
$4 million per year in 2004 and 2005. Also, our
post-retirement plans (other than pension), which are partially
funded with $7 million of assets, had an accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation of $54.5 million at
December 31, 2004. In the full year 2004, we contributed
$5.7 million towards pre-funding these benefits. In
addition, the expected Company payments to retirees and
dependents under the postretirement plan are approximately
$1.2 million per year in 2004 and 2005. See Note 18 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this prospectus.

We estimate that our capital expenditures in connection with our
name change and rebranding initiative have been approximately
$10 million, which were expensed in 2004. We are not
currently planning to make any other significant capital
expenditures in 2005.

During January 2004, we paid to participants in the Assurant
Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan an aggregate of
$25 million in connection with the cash-out of all
outstanding Fortis incentive rights.

In management’s opinion, our subsidiaries’ cash flow
from operations together with our income and gains from our
investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity to meet
our needs in the ordinary course of business.

Cash Flows

We monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary
levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary
levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and
variance analyses to project future cash needs making
adjustments to the forecasts when needed.

Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002.

The key changes of the net cash outflow of
$151 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 were
net purchases of fixed maturity securities of
$1,238 million, maturities of these securities of
$851 million, repayment of debt in the amount of
$1,750 million, issuance of debt of $972 million, and
issuance of common stock of $725 million. The key changes
of the net cash inflow of $348 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 were net purchases of fixed maturity
securities of $1,929 million, maturities of these
securities of $1,131 million and issuance of debt in the
amount of $2,400 million. Key changes of the net cash
outflow of $58 million for the year ended December 31,
2002 were net purchases of fixed maturity securities of
$1,164 million and maturities of these securities of
$858 million.

At December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of
$996 million, as compared to $1,970 million at
December 31, 2003 and $1,471 million at
December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2004, this debt
consisted of $972 million of senior notes and
$24 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.

Commitments and Contingencies

We have obligations and commitments to third parties as a result
of our operations. These obligations and commitments, as of
December 31, 2004, are detailed in the table below by
maturity date as of the dates indicated:

(1)

Insurance liabilities, reflected in the commitments and
    contingencies table above, include products for which we are
    currently making periodic payments and products for which we are
    not making periodic payments, but for which we believe the
    amount and timing of future payments is essentially fixed and
    determinable. Amounts included in insurance liabilities reflect
    estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders. The total
    amount represents the claims and benefits payable on all of our
    long and short duration contracts with the exception of
    $216 million related to our FFG and LTC disposed
    businesses. The payment of these liabilities has been fully
    reinsured. See “Item 1 —
    Business — Business Dispositions.”

Liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses of
$6,413 million and unearned premiums of $3,354 million
as of December 31, 2004 have been excluded from the
commitments and contingencies table. Significant uncertainties
relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity,
expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract
terms and the timing of payments. These liabilities have been
excluded from the table above because the determination of these
liability amounts and the timing of payments are not reasonably
fixed and determinable since the insurable event, payment
triggering or revenue recognition event has not yet occurred.

In addition, as of December 31, 2004, the Assurant
Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan liability was
$49 million. This liability will be paid based on the plan
description.

Letters of Credit

In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued
primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of
credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions.
We had approximately $66 million and $117 million of
letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, respectively.



RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Company

Our profitability may decline if we are unable to maintain
    our relationships with significant clients, distributors and
    other parties important to the success of our business.

Our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant
clients, distributors and other parties with which we do
business are important to the success of our business segments.
Many of these arrangements are exclusive. For example, in
Assurant Solutions, we have exclusive relationships with several
mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, credit card issuers
and other financial institutions through which we distribute our
products. In Assurant Health, we have exclusive distribution
relationships for our individual health insurance products with
IPSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (State Farm), and USAA, as well as a
relationship with HAA, the association through which we provide
many of our individual health insurance products through
Assurant Health’s agreement dated September 1, 2003
with its administrator, NAC. An association in the health
insurance market is an entity formed and maintained in good
faith for purposes other than obtaining insurance and does not
make health insurance coverage offered through the association
available other than in connection with membership in the
association. The agreement that provides for our exclusive
distribution relationship with IPSI terminates in June 2008, but
may be extended if agreed to by both parties. We also maintain
contractual relationships with several separate networks of
health and dental care providers, each referred to as a PPO,
through which we obtain discounts. A PPO is an entity that acts
as an intermediary between an insurer and a network of
hospitals, physicians, dentists or other providers of health
care who have agreed to provide care to insureds subject to
contractually established reimbursement rates. In Assurant
PreNeed, we have an exclusive distribution relationship with
SCI. Many of these arrangements have terms ranging from one to
five years. Although we believe we have generally been
successful in maintaining our client, distribution and related
relationships, if these parties decline to renew or seek to
terminate these arrangements or seek to renew these contracts on
less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition,
we are subject to the risk that these parties may face financial
difficulties, reputational issues or problems with respect to
their own products and services, which may lead to decreased
sales of our products and services. Moreover, if one or more of
our clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with
other companies, we may lose business or suffer decreased
revenues. A loss of the discount arrangements with PPOs could
also lead to higher medical or dental costs and/or a loss of
members to other medical or dental plans.

For example, Assurant Solutions lost a few clients over the last
three years as a result of bankruptcies and termination of
contracts either by it or its clients; however, none of the
clients lost was significant to its business. At Assurant
Health, client turnover has been stable over the last three
years as none of the clients lost was significant to its
business. Assurant PreNeed terminated several client
relationships with three funeral home groups in 2003 because of
profitability issues with the business; none of the clients
terminated was significant to its business.

Sales of our products and services may be reduced if we
    are unable to attract and retain sales representatives or
    develop and maintain distribution sources.

We distribute our insurance products and services through a
variety of distribution channels including: independent employee
benefits specialists, brokers, managing general agents, life
agents, financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers,
retailers, funeral directors, association groups and other
third-party marketing organizations.

Our relationships with these various distributors are
significant both for our revenues and profits. We do not
distribute our insurance products and services through captive
or affiliated agents. In Assurant Health, we depend in large
part on the services of independent agents and brokers and on
associations, including HAA, in the marketing of our products.
In Assurant Employee Benefits, independent agents and brokers
who act as advisors to our customers, market and distribute our
products. Independent agents and brokers are typically not
exclusively dedicated to us and usually also market products of
our competitors. Strong competition exists



among insurers to form relationships with agents and brokers of
demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for sales
representatives, agents and brokers primarily on the basis of
our financial position, support services, compensation and
product features. In addition, by relying on independent agents
and brokers to distribute products for us, we face continued
competition from our competitors’ products. Moreover, our
ability to market our products and services depends on our
ability to tailor our channels of distribution to comply with
changes in the regulatory environment. Recently, the marketing
of health insurance through association groups and broker
compensation arrangements have come under increased scrutiny. An
interruption in, or changes to, our relationships with various
third-party distributors or our inability to respond to
regulatory changes could impair our ability to compete and
market our insurance products and services and materially
adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

We have our own sales representatives whose role in the
distribution process varies by segment. We depend in large part
on our sales representatives to develop and maintain client
relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective
sales representatives could materially adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

General economic, financial market and political
    conditions may adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial condition.

Our results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected from time to time by general
economic, financial market and political conditions. These
conditions include economic cycles such as insurance industry
cycles, levels of employment, levels of consumer lending, levels
of inflation and movements of the financial markets.

Fluctuations in interest rates, monetary policy, demographics,
and legislative and competitive factors also influence our
performance. During periods of economic downturn:

In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs
of medical and dental care, as well as repair and replacement
costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the
costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect
the costs associated with our pre-funded funeral insurance
policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with
the CPI. Pre-funded funeral insurance provides benefits to fund
the costs incurred in connection with a pre-arranged funeral
contract, which is an arrangement between a funeral firm and an
individual whereby the funeral firm agrees to perform a selected
funeral upon the individual’s death.

Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for
    claims, which may require us to establish additional reserves
    that may materially reduce our earnings, profitability and
    capital.

We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure
for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to
reported and unreported claims IBNR as of the end of each
accounting period. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or
SAP, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but
instead represent our best estimates, generally involving
actuarial projections at a given time, of what we expect the
ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of
claims will cost based on our assessment of facts



and circumstances then known. The adequacy of reserves will be
impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency,
judicial theories of liability and other factors. These
variables are affected by both external and internal events,
such as: changes in the economic cycle, changes in the social
perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions
regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability,
emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or
accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes
and claims handling procedures.

Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly
on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as
experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and
negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the
period in which such estimates are updated. Because
establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process
involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty
that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves.
However, future loss development could require reserves to be
increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our
earnings in the periods in which such increases are made.

We may be unable to accurately predict benefits, claims
    and other costs or to manage such costs through our loss
    limitation methods, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting
benefits, claims and other costs, including medical and dental
costs, and predictions regarding the frequency and magnitude of
claims on our disability and property coverages. It also depends
on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through
product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or
claims management and, in health and dental insurance,
negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Utilization review
is a review process designed to control and limit medical
expenses, which includes, among other things, requiring
certification for admission to a health care facility and
cost-effective ways of handling patients with catastrophic
illnesses. Claims management entails the use of a variety of
means to mitigate the extent of losses incurred by insureds and
the corresponding benefit cost, which includes efforts to
improve the quality of medical care provided to insureds and to
assist them with vocational services. The aging of the
population and other demographic characteristics and advances in
medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care
costs. Our ability to predict and manage costs and claims, as
well as our business, results of operations and financial
condition may be adversely affected by: changes in health and
dental care practices, inflation, new technologies, the cost of
prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the
regulatory environment, economic factors, the occurrence of
catastrophes and numerous other factors affecting the cost of
health and dental care and the frequency and severity of claims
in all our business segments.

The judicial and regulatory environments, changes in the
composition of the kinds of work available in the economy,
market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially
adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. As a result
of one or more of these factors or other factors, claims could
substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other
environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended
issues relating to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues
could materially adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition by either extending coverage beyond our
underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of
claims or both. We may be limited in our ability to respond to
such changes, by insurance regulations, existing contract terms,
contract filing requirements, market conditions or other
factors

.

Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that
    may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our
    sales and profitability.

Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses
    that could reduce our profitability.

Investment returns are an important part of our overall
profitability and significant fluctuations in the fixed income
market could impair our profitability, financial condition
and/or cash flows. Our investments are



subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to
risks inherent in particular securities. In particular,
volatility of claims may force us to liquidate securities prior
to maturity, which may cause us to incur capital losses. If we
do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is
appropriately matched with our insurance liabilities, we may be
forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a
significant loss to cover such liabilities. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, our net investment income was
$635 million and our net realized gains on investments were
$24 million, which collectively accounted for approximately
9% of our total revenues during such period. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, our net investment income was
$607 million and our net realized gains on investments were
$2 million, which collectively accounted for approximately
9% of our total revenues during such period.

The performance of our investment portfolio is subject to
    fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market
    conditions.

Changes in interest rates can negatively affect the performance
of some of our investments. Interest rate volatility can reduce
unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios.
Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including
governmental monetary policies, domestic and international
economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our
control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on,
and the market value of, fixed maturity and short-term
investments, which comprised $9,478 million, or 82%, of the
fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2004
and $9,005 million, or 82%, as of December 31, 2003.

The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our
portfolio and the investment income from these securities
fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions.
The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an
inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while
net investment income realized by us from future investments in
fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease
with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income
and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk,
such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may
differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a
result of interest rate fluctuations. In periods of declining
interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and
bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid
or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates,
and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower
interest-bearing investments. As of December 31, 2004,
mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities represented
approximately $1,677 million, or 14%, of the fair value of
our total investments.

Because substantially all of our fixed maturity securities are
classified as available for sale, changes in the market value of
these securities are reflected in our balance sheet. Similar
treatment is not available for liabilities. Therefore, interest
rate fluctuations affect the value of our investments and could
materially adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

We employ asset/ liability matching strategies to reduce the
adverse effects of interest rate volatility and to ensure that
cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due. Our
asset/ liability matching strategies include: asset/ liability
duration management, structuring our bond and commercial
mortgage loan portfolios to limit the effects of prepayments and
consistent monitoring of, and appropriate changes to, the
pricing of our products.

However, these strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the
adverse effects of interest rate volatility, and no assurances
can be given that significant fluctuations in the level of
interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, Assurant PreNeed generally writes whole life
insurance policies with increasing death benefits. Whole life
insurance refers to a form of life insurance that provides
guaranteed death benefits and guaranteed cash values to
policyholders. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 83%
of Assurant PreNeed’s in force insurance policy reserves
related to policies that provide for death benefit growth, some
of which provide for minimum death benefit growth pegged to
changes in the CPI. In extended periods of declining interest
rates or high inflation, there may be compression in the spread
between Assurant PreNeed’s death benefit growth rates and
its investment earnings or a negative spread. As a result,
declining interest rates or



high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and our overall financial condition.

Assurant Employee Benefits calculates reserves for long-term
disability and life waiver of premium claims using net present
value calculations based on current interest rates at the time
claims are funded and expectations regarding future interest
rates. Waiver of premium refers to a provision in a life
insurance policy pursuant to which an insured with total
disability that lasts for a specified period no longer has to
pay premiums for the duration of the disability or for a stated
period, during which time the life insurance coverage provides
continued coverage. If interest rates decline, reserves for open
and/or new claims would need to be calculated using lower
discount rates thereby increasing the net present value of those
claims and the required reserves. Depending on the magnitude of
the decline, this could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
investment income may be lower than that assumed in setting
premium rates.

Our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk.

We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio,
primarily from our investments in corporate bonds and preferred
stocks. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance
of their obligations could reduce our investment income and
realized investment gains or result in investment losses.
Further, the value of any particular fixed maturity security is
subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of a given
issuer. As of December 31, 2004, we held
$9,178 million of fixed maturity securities, or 76% of the
fair value of our total invested assets at such date. Our fixed
maturity portfolio also includes below investment grade
securities, which comprised 6% of the fair value of our total
fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003. These investments generally provide
higher expected returns but present greater risk and can be less
liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase
in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities
portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition. Other-than-temporary
impairment losses on our available for sale securities totaled
$0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and
$20 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2004, less than 1% of the fair value of
our total investments was invested in common stock; however, we
have had higher percentages in the past and may make more such
investments in the future. Investments in common stock generally
provide higher expected total returns, but present greater risk
to preservation of principal than our fixed income investments.

In addition, while currently we do not utilize derivative
instruments to hedge or manage our interest rate or equity risk,
we may do so in the future. Derivative instruments generally
present greater risk than fixed income investments or equity
investments because of their greater sensitivity to market
fluctuations. Effective as of August 1, 2003, we utilize
derivative instruments in managing Assurant PreNeed’s
exposure to inflation risk. While these instruments seek to
protect a portion of Assurant PreNeed’s existing business
that is tied to the CPI, a sharp increase in inflation could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

Our commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments
    subject us to liquidity risk.

As of December 31, 2004, commercial mortgage loans on real
estate investments represented approximately 9% of the fair
value of our total investments. These types of investments are
relatively illiquid, thus increasing our liquidity risk. In
addition, if we require extremely large amounts of cash on short
notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at
attractive prices, in a timely manner, or both.

The risk parameters of our investment portfolio may not
    target an appropriate level of risk, thereby reducing our
    profitability and diminishing our ability to compete and
    grow.

We seek to earn returns on our investments to enhance our
ability to offer competitive rates and prices to our customers.
Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a
function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each of
our business segments. However, we may not succeed in targeting
an appropriate overall risk level for our investment portfolio.
As a result, the return on our investments may be insufficient to



meet our profit targets over the long term, thereby reducing our
profitability. If, in response, we choose to increase our
product prices to maintain profitability, we may diminish our
ability to compete and grow.

Environmental liability exposure may result from our
    commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate
    investments.

Liability under environmental protection laws resulting from our
commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments
may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.
Under the laws of several states, contamination of a property
may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of
the costs of the cleanup. In some states, this kind of lien has
priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the
property, which would impair our ability to foreclose on that
property should the related loan be in default. In addition,
under the laws of some states and under the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for
costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous
substances that require remedy at a property securing a mortgage
loan held by us. We also may face this liability after
foreclosing on a property securing a mortgage loan held by us
after a loan default.

Catastrophe losses, including man-made catastrophe losses,
    could materially reduce our profitability and have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of
catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners, life and other
personal business lines. We have experienced, and expect in the
future to experience, catastrophe losses that may materially
reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes
can be caused by various natural events, including hurricanes,
windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather,
fires and epidemics, or can be man-made catastrophes, including
terrorist attacks or accidents such as airplane crashes. The
frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently
unpredictable. Catastrophe losses can vary widely and could
significantly exceed our recent historic results. It is possible
that both the frequency and severity of man-made catastrophes
will increase and that we will not be able to implement
exclusions from coverage in our policies or obtain reinsurance
for such catastrophes.

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both
the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
event and the severity of the event. Most of our catastrophe
claims in the past have related to homeowners and other personal
lines coverages, which for the year ended December 31, 2004
represented approximately 26% of our net earned premiums and
other consideration in our Assurant Solutions segment. In
addition, as of December 31, 2004, approximately 35.6% of
the insurance in force in our homeowners and other personal
lines related to properties located in California, Florida and
Texas. As a result of our creditor-placed homeowners insurance
product, which typically provides coverage against an
insured’s property being destroyed or damaged by various
perils, our concentration in these areas may increase in the
future. This is because in our creditor-placed homeowners
insurance line, we agree to provide homeowners insurance
coverage automatically. If other insurers withdraw coverage in
these or other states, this may lead to adverse selection and
increased utilization of our creditor-placed homeowners
insurance in these areas. Adverse selection refers to the
process by which an applicant who believes himself to be
uninsurable, or at greater than average risk, seeks to obtain an
insurance policy at a standard premium rate.

Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophes could
cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any
fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our
profitability or harm our financial condition. Our ability to
write new business also could be affected. Increases in the
value and geographic concentration of insured property and the
effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from
catastrophes in the future.



Pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $1 million (before
the benefits of reinsurance) that we have experienced in recent
years include:

No liquidation in investments was required in connection with
these catastrophes as the claims were paid from current cash
flow, cash on hand or short-term investments.

In addition, our group life and health insurance operations
could be materially impacted by catastrophes such as terrorist
attacks or by an epidemic that causes a widespread increase in
mortality, morbidity or disability rates or that causes an
increase in the need for medical care. The mortality rate refers
to the relationship of the frequency of deaths of individual
members of a group to the entire group membership over a
specified period of time. The morbidity rate refers to the
relationship of the incidence of disease or disability
contracted by individual members of a group to the entire group
membership over a specified period of time. For example, the
influenza epidemic of 1918 caused several million deaths. Losses
due to catastrophes would not generally be covered by
reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in
Assurant PreNeed the average age of policyholders is in excess
of 72 years. This group is more susceptible to epidemics
than the overall population, and an epidemic resulting in a
higher incidence of mortality could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to manage these risks depends in part on our
successful utilization of catastrophic property and life
reinsurance to limit the size of property and life losses from a
single event or multiple events, and life and disability
reinsurance to limit the size of life or disability insurance
exposure on an individual insured life. It also depends in part
on state regulation that may prohibit us from excluding such
risks or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in
catastrophe-prone areas. As discussed further below, catastrophe
reinsurance for our group insurance lines is not currently
widely available. This means that the occurrence of a
significant catastrophe could materially reduce our
profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition.

Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us
    against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of
    reinsurers.

As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we
purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our
various business segments. Market conditions beyond our control
determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance
protection we purchase. For example, subsequent to the terrorist
assaults of September 11, 2001, reinsurance for man-made
catastrophes became generally unavailable due to capacity
constraints and, to the limited extent available, much more
expensive. The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable
coverage could adversely affect our results. If we fail to
obtain sufficient reinsurance, it could adversely affect our
ability to write future business.

As part of our business, we have reinsured certain life,
property and casualty and health risks to reinsurers. Although
the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded
reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks
reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not
eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit
risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from
reinsurers. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance
recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay



such recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurer’s
insolvency, underwriting results or investment returns may
affect its ability to fulfill reinsurance obligations.

Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual
renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance
facilities and, even where highly desirable or necessary, we may
not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate
amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our
expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities,
either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling
to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the
level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potential
developments could materially adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Historically, we have maintained reinsurance on a significant
portion of our Assurant Health business, but we will not renew
or replace this reinsurance effective as of December 31,
2004 and therefore, we will not be entitled to certain
reinsurance recoverables to which we were previously entitled.

We have sold businesses through reinsurance that could
    again become our direct financial and administrative
    responsibility if the purchasing companies were to become
    insolvent.

We have sold businesses through reinsurance ceded to third
parties, such as our 2001 sale of the insurance operations of
our FFG division to The Hartford. The assets backing the
liabilities on these businesses are held in a trust, and the
separate accounts relating to the FFG business are still
reflected on our balance sheet. Such separate accounts represent
assets allocated under certain policies and contracts that are
segregated from the general account and other separate accounts.
The policyholder or contractholder bears the risk of investments
held in a separate account. However, we would be responsible for
administering this business in the event of a default by the
reinsurer. We do not have the administrative systems and
capabilities to process this business today. Accordingly, we
would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an
insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers of these businesses.
We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable
terms, with a resulting material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to the credit risk of our agents in
    Assurant PreNeed and our clients in Assurant Solutions.

We advance agents’ commissions as part of our pre-funded
funeral insurance product offerings. These advances are a
percentage of the total face amount of coverage as opposed to a
percentage of the first-year premium paid, the formula that is
more common in other life insurance markets. There is a one-year
payback provision against the agency if death or lapse occurs
within the first policy year. There is a very large producer
within Assurant PreNeed and if it were unable to fulfill its
payback obligations, it could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. However, we have
not had any loss experience with this very large producer to
date. In addition, we are subject to the credit risk of the
parties with which we contract in Assurant Solutions. If these
parties fail to remit payments owed to us or pass on payments
they collect on our behalf, it could have an adverse effect on
our results of operations.

A further decline in the manufactured housing market may
    adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

The manufactured housing industry has experienced a significant
decline in both shipments and retail sales in the last six
years. Manufactured housing shipments have decreased from
approximately 350,000 in 1999 to approximately 120,000
(annualized) in 2004, representing a 66% decline.
Repossessions are at an all time high, resale values have been
significantly reduced and several lenders, dealers,
manufacturers and vertically integrated manufactured housing
companies have either ceased operations or gone bankrupt. This
downturn in the industry is the result of several factors,
including excess production, aggressive sales practices, reduced
underwriting standards and poor lending practices. As a result
of this downturn, the industry has experienced consolidation,
with the leaders purchasing the weaker competitors. If these
downward trends continue, our results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected.



The financial strength of our insurance company
    subsidiaries is rated by A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P,
    and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the
    insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to
    decrease.

Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in
establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.
Most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated
by A.M. Best. Six of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries are rated by Moody’s and seven of our domestic
operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P. The
ratings reflect A.M. Best’s, Moody’s, and
S&P’s opinions of our subsidiaries’ financial
strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability
to meet their obligations to policyholders. The ratings are not
evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to
buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings are subject to
periodic review by A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P, and we
cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these ratings.

All of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries rated by
A.M. Best have financial strength ratings of A
(“Excellent”), which is the second highest of ten
ratings categories and the highest within the category based on
modifiers (i.e., A and A- are “Excellent”) or A-
(“Excellent”), which is the second highest of ten
ratings categories and the lowest within the category based on
modifiers.

The Moody’s financial strength rating is A2
(“Good”) for one of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings
categories and mid-range within the category based on modifiers
(i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are “Good”), and A3
(“Good”) for five of our domestic operating insurance
subsidiaries, which is the third highest of nine ratings
categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers.

The S&P financial strength rating is A (“Strong”)
for four of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which
is the third highest of nine ratings categories and mid-range
within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A- are
“Strong”), and A- (“Strong”) for three of
our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, which is the
third highest of nine ratings categories and the lowest within
the category based on modifiers.

Rating agencies review their ratings periodically and our
current ratings may not be maintained in the future. If our
ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best,
Moody’s, or S&P, or placed under surveillance or review
with possible negative implications, our competitive position in
the respective insurance industry segments could suffer and it
could be more difficult for us to market our products. Rating
agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future due
to, among other things: the competitive environment in the
insurance industry, which may adversely affect our revenues, the
inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims,
which may cause us to increase our reserves for claims, the
outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations,
which may adversely affect our financial position and reputation
and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by
the rating agencies.

As customers and their advisors place importance on our
financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and compete
less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition, ratings
impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable
terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their
current levels by A.M. Best, Moody’s, or S&P, our cost
of borrowing would likely increase, our sales and earnings could
decrease and our results of operations and financial condition
could be materially adversely affected.

Contracts representing approximately 22% of Assurant
Solutions’ net earned premiums and fee income for the year
ended December 31, 2004 contain provisions requiring the
applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial
strength ratings ranging from “A” or better to
“B” or better, depending on the contract. Our clients
may terminate these contracts if the subsidiaries’ ratings
fall below these minimum acceptable levels. Under our ten-year
marketing agreement with SCI, AMLIC, one of our subsidiaries in
the Assurant PreNeed segment, is required to maintain an A.M.
Best financial strength rating of “B” or better
throughout the term of the agreement. If AMLIC fails to maintain
this rating for a period of 180 days, SCI may terminate the
agreement. In our Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits
segments, we do not have any material contracts that permit
termination in the case of a ratings downgrade.



The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our
    information systems could adversely affect our business.

Our business is dependent upon our ability to keep up to date
with technological advances. This is particularly important in
Assurant Solutions, where our systems, including our ability to
keep our systems integrated with those of our clients, are
critical to the operation of our business. Our failure to update
our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect
our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability
to do business with our clients.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we have spent
approximately $118 million in Assurant Solutions,
$81 million in Assurant Health, $67 million in
Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant
PreNeed to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information
systems. In 2005, we plan to spend for these purposes
approximately $126 million in Assurant Solutions,
$89 million in Assurant Health, $62 million in
Assurant Employee Benefits and $5 million in Assurant
PreNeed.

In addition, our business depends significantly on effective
information systems, and we have many different information
systems for our various businesses. We must commit significant
resources to maintain and enhance our existing information
systems and develop new information systems in order to keep
pace with continuing changes in information processing
technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and
changing customer preferences. As a result of our acquisition
activities, we have acquired additional information systems. Our
failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems,
or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our
information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete
applications, could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. If we do not
maintain adequate systems we could experience adverse
consequences, including: inadequate information on which to base
pricing; underwriting and reserving decisions; the loss of
existing customers; difficulty in attracting new customers;
customer, provider and agent disputes; regulatory problems, such
as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; litigation
exposure; or increases in administrative expenses.

Our management information, internal control and financial
reporting systems may need further enhancements and development
to satisfy the financial and other reporting requirements of
being a public company.

Efforts to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will entail
    significant expenditure; non-compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act may adversely affect us.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that became law in July 2002 and
rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NYSE require
changes to some of our accounting and corporate governance
practices, including the requirement that we issue a report on
our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are required to comply with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by December 31,
2005. We expect these new rules and regulations to continue to
increase our accounting, legal and other costs, and to make some
activities more difficult, time consuming and/or costly. In the
event that we are unable to maintain or achieve compliance with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules, it may have a material
adverse effect on us.

Failure to protect our clients’ confidential
    information and privacy could result in the loss of customers,
    reduction to our profitability and/or subject us to fines and
    penalties.

A number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations
and to confidentiality obligations. For example, the collection
and use of patient data in our Assurant Health segment is the
subject of national and state legislation, including the HIPAA,
and certain of the activities conducted by our Assurant
Solutions segment are subject to the privacy regulations of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We also have contractual obligations to
protect certain confidential information we obtain from our
existing vendors and clients. These obligations generally
include protecting such confidential information in the same
manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential
information. The actions we take to protect such confidential
information vary by business segment and may include among other
things: training and educating our employees regarding our
obligations relating to confidential information; actively
monitoring our record



retention plans and any changes in state or federal privacy and
compliance requirements; drafting appropriate contractual
provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and
confidentiality issues; maintaining secure storage facilities
for tangible records; and limiting access to electronic
information and maintaining a “clean desk policy”
aimed at safeguarding certain current information.

In addition, we must develop, implement and maintain a
comprehensive written information security program with
appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to
protect such confidential information. If we do not properly
comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential
information we could experience adverse consequences, including
loss of clients and related revenue, regulatory problems, loss
of reputation and client litigation.

See “Risks Related to Our Industry — Cost of
compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business
and results of operations.”

We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new
    insurance ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully
    integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in
    such ventures.

From time to time, we evaluate possible acquisition transactions
and the start-up of complementary businesses, and at any given
time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible
acquisitions and new ventures. While our business model is not
dependent upon acquisitions or new insurance ventures, the time
frame for achieving or further improving upon our desired market
positions can be significantly shortened through opportune
acquisitions or new insurance ventures. Historically,
acquisitions and new insurance ventures have played a
significant role in achieving desired market positions in some,
but not all, of our businesses. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or
insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and
completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or
ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any
companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

In addition, implementation of an acquisition strategy entails a
number of risks, including among other things: inaccurate
assessment of undisclosed liabilities; difficulties in realizing
projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; failure to
achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; an increase
in our indebtedness; and a limitation in our ability to access
additional capital when needed.

Our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could
materially adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. Although we believe that most of our
acquisitions have been successful and have not had a material
adverse impact on our financial condition, we did recognize a
goodwill impairment of $1,261 million in 2002 related to an
earlier acquisition.

The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us
    in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to meet our
    obligations and pay future stockholder dividends.

As a holding company whose principal assets are the capital
stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and
other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to
meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on
outstanding debt obligations, dividends to stockholders
(including any dividends on our common stock) and corporate
expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and
to make such other payments in the future will depend on their
statutory surplus, future statutory earnings and regulatory
restrictions. Except to the extent that we are a creditor with
recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of the
subsidiaries’ creditors, including policyholders, have
priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the
subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors. If any of our
subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise
reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to
proceed against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the
liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under
applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws. The
applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our
insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings
relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that
jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the
subsidiary. Both creditors and policyholders of the subsidiary
would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiary’s
assets before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive
any distribution from the subsidiary.



The payment of dividends to us by any of our operating
subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e., extraordinary
dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary’s domiciliary
state department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no
regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to
amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The
formula for the majority of the states in which our subsidiaries
are domiciled is the lesser of (i) 10% of the statutory
surplus as of the end of the prior year or (ii) the prior
year’s statutory net income. In some states, the formula is
the greater amount of clauses (i) and (ii). Some states,
however, have an additional stipulation that dividends may only
be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine
that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by
our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax
sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services)
would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators
may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted
without prior approval. No assurance can be given that there
will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability
of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Based on the
dividend restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the
maximum amount of dividends that our subsidiaries could pay to
us in 2005 without regulatory approval is approximately
$364 million. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries totaled
$361.7 million through December 31, 2004. We may seek
approval of regulators to pay dividends in excess of any amounts
that would be permitted without such approval. However, there
can be no assurance that we would seek such approval or would
obtain such approval. If the ability of insurance subsidiaries
to pay dividends or make other payments to us is materially
restricted by regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect
our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock and/or
service our debt and pay our other corporate expenses.

Our credit facilities also contain limitations on our ability to
pay dividends to our shareholders if we are in default or such
dividend payments would cause us to be in default of the credit
facilities.

Risks Related to Our Industry

Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and
    regulatory actions.

In addition to the occasional employment-related litigation to
which businesses are subject, we are a defendant in actions
arising out of, and are involved in, various regulatory
investigations and examinations relating to, our insurance and
other related business operations. We may from time to time be
subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to
our current and past business operations, including, but not
limited to:

The outcome of these actions cannot be predicted, and no
assurances can be given that such actions or any litigation
would not materially adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition. In



addition, if we were to experience difficulties with our
relationship with a regulatory body in a given jurisdiction, it
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do
business in that jurisdiction.

In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal
claims against insurance and related companies. Current and
future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our
exposure to these types of claims. Multiparty or class action
claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic,
non-economic or punitive damage awards. The loss of even one of
these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award or a
judicial ruling that was otherwise detrimental, could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. This risk of potential liability may make
reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We
cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of
recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our
businesses.

Recently, the insurance industry has experienced substantial
volatility as a result of current litigation, investigations and
regulatory activity by various insurance, governmental and
enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the
insurance industry. These practices include the payment of
contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance
brokers and agents and the extent to which such compensation has
been disclosed, the solicitation and provision of fictitious or
inflated quotes and the use of inducements to brokers or
companies in the sale of group insurance products. In accordance
with a long-standing and widespread industry practice, we have
paid and may continue to pay contingent commissions to insurance
brokers and agents, primarily in our Assurant Employee Benefits
segment. We purchase reinsurance, including but not limited to
reinsurance agreements that share risks and profits with certain
clients in our Assurant Solutions segment on business produced
by these clients. These clients include mortgage lenders and
servicers, financial institutions and retailers. We have
received inquiries and informational requests from insurance
departments in certain states in which our insurance
subsidiaries operate. We have conducted an internal review under
the supervision of outside counsel to confirm that our employees
have not provided inflated or fictitious quotes or used improper
inducements in the sale of group insurance products in our
Assurant Employee Benefits segment. Another focus of regulators
has been the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or
other non-traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. One
of our reinsurers thinks we should have been accounting for
premiums ceded to them as a loan instead of as an expense.
Management believes that the difference in treatment would be
immaterial to the Company’s financial position or results
of operations. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, premiums ceded to this
reinsurer were $2.6 million, $1.5 million and
$0.5 million, respectively, and losses ceded were
$10 million, $0, and $0, respectively. We cannot predict at
this time the effect that current litigation, investigations and
regulatory activity will have on the insurance industry or our
business. Given our prominent position in the insurance
industry, it is possible that we will become subject to further
investigations and have lawsuits filed against us. Our
involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to
incur legal costs and, if we were found to have violated any
laws, we could be required to pay fines and damages, perhaps in
material amounts. In addition, we could be materially adversely
affected by the negative publicity for the insurance industry
related to these proceedings, and by any new industry-wide
regulations or practices that may result from these proceedings.
See “Item 1 — Business —
Regulation.”

We face significant competitive pressures in our
    businesses, which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from
    pricing our products at rates that will allow us to be
    profitable.

In each of our lines of business, we compete with other
insurance companies or service providers, depending on the line
and product, although we have no single competitor who competes
against us in all of the business lines in which we operate.
Assurant Solutions has numerous competitors in its product
lines, but we believe no other company participates in all of
the same lines or offers comprehensive capabilities. Competitors
include insurance companies and financial institutions. In
Assurant Health, we believe the market is characterized by many
competitors, and our main competitors include health insurance
companies, HMO and the Blue Cross/ Blue Shield plans in the
states in which we write business. In Assurant Employee
Benefits, commercial competitors include benefits and life
insurance companies as well as not-for-profit Delta Dental
plans. In Assurant PreNeed, our main competitors are two
pre-need life insurance companies with nationwide
representation, Forethought Financial Services and Homesteaders
Life Company, and several small regional insurers. While we are
among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many
of our business lines, in some cases there are one or more major
market players in a particular line of business.



Competition in our businesses is based on many factors,
including quality of service, product features, price, scope of
distribution, scale, financial strength ratings and name
recognition. We compete, and will continue to compete, for
customers and distributors with many insurance companies and
other financial services companies. We compete not only for
business and individual customers, employer and other group
customers, but also for agents and distribution relationships.
Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products
than our specific subsidiaries with which they compete in
particular markets, may have a greater diversity of distribution
resources, may have better brand recognition, may from time to
time have more competitive pricing, may have lower cost
structures or, with respect to insurers, may have higher
financial strength or claims paying ratings. Some may also have
greater financial resources with which to compete. As a result
of judicial developments and changes enacted by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, financial institutions are now
able to offer a substitute product similar to credit insurance
as part of their basic loan agreement with customers without
being subject to insurance regulations. Credit insurance is
insurance issued to cover the life, unemployment or disability
of a debtor or borrower for an outstanding loan. Also, as a
result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which was enacted in
November 1999, financial institutions are now able to affiliate
with other insurance companies to offer services similar to our
own. This has resulted in new competitors with significant
financial resources entering some of our markets. Moreover, some
of our competitors may have a lower target for returns on
capital allocated to their business than we do, which may lead
them to price their products and services lower than we do. In
addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the
markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at
times when there are new entrants. For example, several large
insurance companies have recently entered the market for
individual health insurance products. We may lose business to
competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or
for other reasons, which could materially adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

In certain markets, we compete with organizations that have a
substantial market share. In addition, with regard to Assurant
Health, organizations with sizable market share or
provider-owned plans may be able to obtain favorable financial
arrangements from health care providers that are not available
to us. Without our own similar arrangements, we may not be able
to compete effectively in such markets.

New competition could also cause the supply of insurance to
change, which could affect our ability to price our products at
attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting
results. Although there are some impediments facing potential
competitors who wish to enter the markets we serve, the entry of
new competitors into our markets can occur, affording our
customers significant flexibility in moving to other insurance
providers.

The insurance industry is cyclical, which may impact our
    results.

The insurance industry is cyclical. Although no two cycles are
the same, insurance industry cycles have typically lasted for
periods ranging from two to six years. The segments of the
insurance markets in which we operate tend not to be correlated
to each other, with each segment having its own cyclicality.
Periods of intense price competition due to excessive
underwriting capacity, periods when shortages of underwriting
capacity permit more favorable rate levels, consequent
fluctuations in underwriting results and the occurrence of other
losses characterize the conditions in these markets.
Historically, insurers have experienced significant fluctuations
in operating results due to volatile and sometimes unpredictable
developments, many of which are beyond the direct control of the
insurer, including competition, frequency of occurrence or
severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general
economic conditions and other factors. This may cause a decline
in revenue at times in the cycle if we choose not to reduce our
product prices in order to maintain our market position, because
of the adverse effect on profitability of such a price
reduction. We can be expected therefore to experience the
effects of such cyclicality and changes in customer expectations
of appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of
claims or other loss events or other factors affecting the
insurance industry that generally could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.



The insurance and related businesses in which we operate
    may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may
    negatively impact our financial results.

The nature of the market for the insurance and related products
and services we provide is that we interface with and distribute
our products and services ultimately to individual consumers.
There may be a perception that these purchasers may be
unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection. Accordingly,
from time to time, consumer advocate groups or the media may
focus attention on our products and services, thereby subjecting
our industries to the possibility of periodic negative
publicity. We may also be negatively impacted if another company
in one of our industries or in a related industry engages in
practices resulting in increased public attention to our
businesses. Negative publicity may result in increased
regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as
well as increased litigation, which may further increase our
costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability
by impeding our ability to market our products and services,
requiring us to change our products or services or increasing
the regulatory burdens under which we operate.

We are subject to extensive governmental laws and
    regulations, which increases our costs and could restrict the
    conduct of our business.

Our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation
and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business.
Such regulation is generally designed to protect the interests
of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and other
investors. To that end, the laws of the various states establish
insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such
things as:



Assurant Health is also required by some jurisdictions to
provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be
considered eligible by insurers. Each of these jurisdictions
dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that
must be provided to such involuntary risks. Our share of these
involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our
respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in
each jurisdiction. Assurant Health is exposed to some risk of
losses in connection with mandated participation in such schemes
in those jurisdictions in which they are still effective. In
addition, HIPAA imposed insurance reform provisions as well as
requirements relating to the privacy of individuals. HIPAA
requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health
insurance coverage for individuals and small groups (generally
50 or fewer employees) and limits exclusions based on
pre-existing conditions. Most of the insurance reform provisions
of HIPAA became effective for plan years beginning July 1,
1997. See also “Risks Related to Our Industry —
Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our
business and results of operations.”

If regulatory requirements impede our ability to raise premium
rates, utilize new policy forms or terminate, deny or cancel
coverage in any of our businesses, our results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The
capacity for an insurance company’s growth in premiums is
in part a function of its statutory surplus. Maintaining
appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by SAP and
procedures, is considered important by insurance regulatory
authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers’
claims-paying abilities and financial strength. Failure to
maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in
increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement, action by
regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies.

We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals
and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of
applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s
interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some
regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to
grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have
the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with
applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory
authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from
carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize
us. That type of action could materially adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition. See
“Item 1 — Business-Regulation.”

Changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and
    limit our growth.

Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the
regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we
are able to do business may significantly harm our business or
results of operations in the future. For example, some states
have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested
covered claims and require health care and dental service plans
to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within
the required time period. Some states have also granted their
insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose
monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental
plans engaging in certain “unfair payment practices.”
If we were to be unable for any reason to comply with these
requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may
materially adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm
us and our subsidiaries include, but are not limited to:

•

legislation that holds insurance companies or managed care
    companies liable for adverse consequences of medical or dental
    decisions;



State legislatures regularly enact laws that alter and, in many
cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance companies
and insurance holding companies. Further, state insurance
regulators regularly reinterpret existing laws and regulations
and the NAIC regularly undertakes regulatory projects, all of
which can affect our operations. In recent years, the state
insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal
scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted
laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further,
the NAIC and state insurance regulators are re-examining
existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on
modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of
existing laws and the development of new laws.

Although the U.S. federal government does not directly
regulate the insurance business, changes in federal legislation
and administrative policies in several areas, including changes
in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial services regulation and
federal taxation, could significantly impact the insurance
industry and us. Federal legislation and administrative policies
in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial
services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our
profitability. In addition, state legislatures and the
U.S. Congress continue to focus on health care issues. The
U.S. Congress is considering Patients’ Bill of Rights
legislation, which, if adopted, would permit health plans to be
sued in state court for coverage determinations and could
fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under
ERISA. There recently have been legislative attempts to limit
ERISA’s preemptive effect on state laws. For example, the
U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered
legislation relating to changes in ERISA to permit application
of state law remedies, such as consequential and punitive
damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if
adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future
litigation. Additionally, there have been attempts by the NAIC
and several states to limit the use of discretionary clauses in
policy forms. The elimination of discretionary clauses could
increase our liability under our health insurance policies. New
interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new
legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and
increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously.

A number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal
level over the past several years that could impose added
burdens on Assurant Health. These proposals would, among other
things, mandate benefits with respect to certain diseases or
medical procedures, require plans to offer an independent
external review of certain coverage decisions and establish a
national health insurance program. Any of these proposals, if
implemented, could adversely affect our results of operations or
financial condition. Federal changes in



Medicare and Medicaid that reduce provider reimbursements could
have negative implications for the private sector due to cost
shifting. When the government reduces reimbursement rates for
Medicare and Medicaid, providers often try to recover shortfalls
by raising the prices charged to privately insured customers.
State small employer group and individual health insurance
market reforms to increase access and affordability could also
reduce profitability by precluding us from appropriately pricing
for risk in our individual and small employer group health
insurance policies.

In addition, the U.S. Congress and some federal agencies
from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance
regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose
federal regulation or to allow an optional federal
incorporation, similar to banks. Bills have been introduced in
the U.S. Congress from time to time that would provide for
a federal scheme of chartering insurance companies or an
optional federal charter for insurance companies. Meanwhile, the
federal government has granted charters in years past to
insurance-like organizations that are not subject to state
insurance regulations, such as risk retention groups. See
“Item 1 — Business —
Regulation — United States — Federal
Regulation — Legislative Developments.” Thus, it
is hard to predict the likelihood of a federal chartering scheme
and its impact on the industry or on us.

We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or
future legislation, regulations or NAIC initiatives may have on
the conduct of our business. In addition, the insurance laws or
regulations adopted or amended from time to time may be more
restrictive or may result in materially higher costs than
current requirements. See “Item 1 —
Business — Regulation.”

It is difficult to predict the effect of the current
investigations in connection with insurance industry practices.
See “— Our business is subject to risks related
to litigation and regulatory actions.”

Costs of compliance with privacy laws could adversely
    affect our business and results of operations.

The privacy of individuals has been the subject of recent state
and federal legislation. State privacy laws, particularly those
with “opt-in” clauses, can affect the pre-funded
funeral insurance business and Solutions business. These laws
make it harder to share information for marketing purposes, such
as generating new sales leads. Similarly, the recently created
“do not call” list would restrict our ability to
contact customers and, in Assurant Solutions, has lowered our
expectations for growth in our direct-marketed consumer credit
insurance products in the United States.

HIPAA and the implementing regulations that have thus far been
adopted impose new obligations for issuers of health and dental
insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors.
HIPAA also establishes new requirements for maintaining the
confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health
information and new standards for electronic health care
transactions. The Department of Health and Human Services
promulgated final HIPAA regulations in 2002. The privacy
regulations required compliance by April 2003, the electronic
transactions regulations by October 2003 and the security
regulations by April 2005. As have other entities in the health
care industry, we have incurred substantial costs in meeting the
requirements of these HIPAA regulations and expect to continue
to incur costs to achieve and to maintain compliance. However,
there can be no assurances that we will achieve such compliance
with all of the required transactions or that other entities
with which we interact will take appropriate action to meet the
compliance deadlines. Moreover, as a consequence of these new
standards for electronic transactions, we may see an increase in
the number of health care transactions that are submitted to us
in paper format, which could increase our costs to process
medical claims.

HIPAA is far-reaching and complex and proper interpretation and
practice under the law continue to evolve. Consequently, our
efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to
comply with HIPAA are ongoing. Failure to comply could result in
regulatory fines and civil lawsuits. Knowing and intentional
violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal
penalties.

In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that we deliver
a notice regarding our privacy policy both at the delivery of
the insurance policy and annually thereafter. Certain exceptions
are allowed for sharing of information under joint marketing
agreements. However, certain state laws may require individuals
to opt in



to information sharing instead of being immediately included.
This could significantly increase costs of doing business.
Additionally, when final U.S. Treasury Department
regulations are promulgated in connection with the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
Intercept and USA PATRIOT Act, we will likely have to expend
additional resources to tailor our existing anti-fraud efforts
to the new rules.

Risks Related to Our Relationship with Fortis

Fortis will continue to have representation on our board
    of directors and influence our affairs for as long as it remains
    a significant stockholder.

As of March 4, 2005, Fortis owned 22,999,130 shares,
or approximately 16%, of our outstanding common stock. We have
entered into a shareholders’ agreement with Fortis pursuant
to which Fortis has the right to nominate designees to our board
of directors and, subject to limited exceptions, our board of
directors will nominate those designees as follows: (i) so
long as Fortis owns less than 50% but at least 10% of our
outstanding shares of common stock, two designees (out of a
maximum of 12 directors); and (ii) so long as Fortis
owns less than 10% but at least 5% of our outstanding shares of
common stock, one designee. Currently, Fortis has two designees
on our board of directors. However, we agreed with Fortis to
terminate the shareholders’ agreement effective upon the
closing of the secondary offering, at which time other corporate
governance arrangements will come into effect. These
arrangements include that, if at any time while there are no
vacancies on our 12-member board of directors, our board of
directors, or a committee thereof, adopts a resolution
(i) recommending to our shareholders that a particular
candidate be elected to our board of directors to replace one of
the Fortis designees or (ii) appointing to our board of
directors a new member, then Fortis will cause one of the Fortis
designees to resign from our board of directors promptly
following the adoption of such resolution. In addition, if at
any time Fortis ceases to own more than 5% of our outstanding
common stock, Fortis will promptly cause any remaining Fortis
designees to resign from our board of directors.

See “Item 13 — Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions” for additional information on related
party transactions between our Company and Fortis.

In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that for
so long as Fortis continues to own less than 50% but at least
10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, our board of
directors will consist of no more than 12 directors
(including at least seven independent directors).

Pursuant to our shareholders’ agreement with Fortis, Fortis
has the right to nominate two designees to our board of
directors (out of a maximum of 12 directors), and the
shareholders’ agreement and our by-laws provide that,
subject to limited exceptions, our board of directors will
nominate those designees. However, we agreed with Fortis to
terminate the shareholders’ agreement effective upon the
closing of the secondary offering, at which time other corporate
governance arrangements will come into effect. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions — Corporate
Governance Arrangements.”

Fortis’ sale of the exchangeable bonds concurrently with
the closing of the secondary offering will not affect
Fortis’ board rights unless the exchangeable bonds are
exchanged for shares of our common stock. The exchangeable bonds
and the 22,999,130 shares of Assurant common stock into
which they are exchangeable have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or
sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable
exemption from registration requirements.



Because Fortis will control us, conflicts of interest
    between Fortis and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable
    to us.

Various conflicts of interest between Fortis and us could arise
which may be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to us,
including, but not limited to, the following areas:

Stock Ownership.

Our shareholders’ agreement
provides that for as long as Fortis owns at least 10% of our
outstanding shares of common stock, the following actions may
only be taken with the approval of Fortis, as stockholder:

•

any recapitalization, reclassification, spin-off or combination
    of any of our securities or any of those of our principal
    subsidiaries; or

•

any liquidation, dissolution, winding up or commencement of
    voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to
    us or our subsidiaries.

For more information regarding the shareholders’ agreement,
see “Item 13 — Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions — Shareholders’
Agreement.”

However, under our new corporate governance arrangements with
Fortis, which became effective upon the closing of the secondary
offering, we will no longer be required to obtain Fortis’
approval for such corporate actions, but Fortis will agree to
vote its shares of our common stock in favor of any such
corporate action if, at any time while at least one Fortis
designee remains on our board of directors, our board of
directors, including any Fortis designee, votes in favor of such
corporate action. For more information regarding these matters,
see “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.”

The exchangeable bonds and the shares of Assurant common stock
into which they are exchangeable have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or
sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable
exemption from registration requirements.

Cross-Directorships.

Michel Baise and Gilbert Mittler are
directors of our Company who are also currently directors and/or
officers of Fortis or the Fortis Group. Service as both a
director of our Company and as a director or officer of Fortis
or the Fortis Group or ownership interests of directors or
officers of our Company in the stock of Fortis Group could
create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when
directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have
different implications for the two companies. Our directors who
are also directors or officers of Fortis or the Fortis Group
will have obligations to both companies and may have conflicts
of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually
involving or affecting us. For example, these decisions could
relate to:

•

disagreement over the desirability of a potential acquisition or
    disposition opportunity; or

•

corporate finance decisions.

Allocation of Business Opportunities.

Although we do not
expect Fortis Group to compete with us in the near term, there
may be business opportunities that are suitable for both Fortis
Group and us. Fortis designees may direct such opportunities to
Fortis and we may have no recourse against the Fortis designees
or the Fortis Group. We have no formal mechanisms for allocating
business opportunities.

Because Fortis Bank operates U.S. branch offices, we
    are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve
    Board under the BHCA.

Fortis Bank S.A./N.V. (Fortis Bank), which is a company in the
Fortis Group, obtained approval in 2002 from state banking
authorities and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (Federal Reserve) to establish branch offices in
Connecticut and New York. By virtue of the opening of these
offices, the Fortis Group’s operations and investments
(including the Fortis Group’s investment in us) became
subject to the nonbanking prohibitions of Section 4 of the
BHCA. Except to the extent that a BHCA exemption or authority is
available, Section 4 of the BHCA does not permit foreign
banking organizations with U.S. branches to own more than
5% of any class of voting shares or otherwise to control any
company that conducts commercial activities, such as
manufacturing, distribution of goods or real estate development.



To broaden the scope of activities and investments permissible
for the Fortis Group and us, the Fortis Group in 2002 notified
the Federal Reserve of its election to be a “financial
holding company” for purposes of the BHCA and the Federal
Reserve’s implementing regulations in Regulation Y. As
a financial holding company, the Fortis Group may own shares of
companies engaged in activities in the United States that are
“financial in nature,” “incidental to such
financial activity” or “complementary to a financial
activity.” Activities that are “financial in
nature” include, among other things:

•

insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying against loss, harm,
    damage, illness, disability or death, or providing and issuing
    annuities; and

•

acting as principal, agent or broker for purposes of the
    foregoing.

In connection with Fortis Bank’s establishment of
U.S. branches, staff of the Federal Reserve inquired as to
whether certain of our activities are financial in nature under
Section 4(k) of the BHCA. In light of the Fortis
Group’s contemplated divestiture of our shares, this
inquiry was suspended at the Fortis Group’s and our
request. To the extent that any of our activities might be
deemed not to be financial in nature under Section 4(k),
the Fortis Group may rely on an exemption in
Section 4(a)(2) of the BHCA that permits the Fortis Group
to continue to hold interests in companies engaged in activities
that are not financial in nature for an initial period of two
years and, with Federal Reserve approval for each extension, for
up to three additional one-year periods. The Federal Reserve
also has the discretion to permit the Fortis Group to hold such
interests after the five-year period under certain provisions
other than Section 4(a)(2). The initial two-year period
under Section 4(a)(2) expired on December 2, 2004. The
Fortis Group has requested an initial one-year extension of the
divestiture period.

If the Federal Reserve does not grant an extension of the
exemption period for any one-year period or if Fortis holds more
than 5% of any class of our voting shares after December 2,
2007, without the consent or acquiescence of the Federal
Reserve, and the Federal Reserve determined that certain of our
activities are nonfinancial, the Fortis Group may be required
(i) to rely on another provision of the BHCA, (ii) to
close the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank, or (iii) to
divest any of our shares exceeding 5% of any class of our voting
shares and to divest any control over us for purposes of the
BHCA.

The Fortis Group will continue to qualify as a financial holding
company so long as Fortis Bank remains “well
capitalized” and “well managed,” as those terms
are defined in Regulation Y. Generally, Fortis Bank will be
considered “well capitalized” if it maintains tier 1
and total RBC ratios of at least 6% and 10%, respectively. The
Fortis Group will be considered “well managed” if it
has received at least a satisfactory composite rating of its
U.S. branch operations at its most recent examination. If
the Fortis Group lost and were unable to regain its financial
holding company status, the Fortis Group could be required
(i) to close the U.S. branches of Fortis Bank or
(ii) to divest any of our shares exceeding 5% of any class
of our voting securities and to divest any control over us for
purposes of the BHCA.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has jurisdiction under the BHCA
over all of the Fortis Group’s direct and indirect
U.S. subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries will be
considered subsidiaries of the Fortis Group for purposes of the
BHCA so long as the Fortis Group owns 25% or more of any class
of our voting shares or otherwise controls or has been
determined to have a controlling influence over us within the
meaning of the BHCA. The Federal Reserve could take the position
that the Fortis Group continues to control us until the Fortis
Group reduces its ownership to less than 5% of our voting
shares. So long as the Fortis Group controls us for purposes of
the BHCA, the Federal Reserve could require us immediately to
discontinue, restructure or divest any of our operations that
are deemed to be impermissible under the BHCA, which could
result in reduced revenues, increased costs or reduced
profitability for us.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and
    by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that
    our stockholders might consider in their best interests.

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may
delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover
attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best
interests. For instance, they may



prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any
premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a
bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover
attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect
the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are
viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may
also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our
directors. These provisions may facilitate directors
entrenchment, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our
control, which may not be in the best interests of our
stockholders.

The following provisions in our certificate of incorporation and
by-laws have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or
prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider
in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of
incorporation and by-laws:

In addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an
“interested stockholder” to engage in business
combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to
include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting
stock.

Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect
    a change of control of our Company.

Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance
company, prior written approval must be obtained from the
insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer
is domiciled. Generally, state statutes provide that control
over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person,
directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to
vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting
securities of the domestic insurer. However, the State of
Florida, in which certain of our insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, defines control as 5% or more. Because a person
acquiring 5% or more of our common stock would indirectly
control the same percentage of the stock of our Florida
subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of Florida
would apply to such transaction and at 10%, the laws of many
other states would likely apply to such a transaction. Prior to
granting approval of an application to acquire control of a
domestic insurer, a state insurance commissioner will typically
consider such factors as the financial strength of the
applicant, the integrity of the applicant’s board of
directors and executive officers, the applicant’s plans for
the future operations of the domestic insurer and any
anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of
the acquisition of control.



Our stock and the stocks of other companies in the
    insurance industry are subject to stock price and trading volume
    volatility.

From time to time, the stock price and the number of shares
traded of companies in the insurance industry experience periods
of significant volatility. Company-specific issues and
developments generally in the insurance industry and in the
regulatory environment may cause this volatility. Our stock
price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and
factors, including:

In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may
adversely affect the trading price of our common stock,
regardless of our actual operating performance.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

As a provider of insurance products, effective risk management
is fundamental to our ability to protect both our
customers’ and stockholders’ interests. We are exposed
to potential loss from various market risks, in particular
interest rate risk and credit risk. Additionally we are exposed
to inflation risk and to a small extent to foreign currency risk.

Interest rate risk is the possibility the fair value of
liabilities will change more or less than the market value of
investments in response to changes in interest rates, including
changes in the slope or shape of the yield curve and changes in
spreads due to credit risks and other factors.

Credit risk is the possibility that counterparties may not be
able to meet payment obligations when they become due. We assume
counterparty credit risk in many forms. A counterparty is any
person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration
are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us.
Primarily, our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed
income investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, in our
reinsurance recoverables.

Inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic
price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings. This
typically happens when only one of invested assets or
liabilities is indexed to inflation.

Foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in
exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity
when measured in domestic currency. This risk is largest when
assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested
in financial instruments of another currency. Our general
principle is to invest in assets that match the currency in
which we expect the liabilities to be paid.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk arises as we invest substantial funds in
interest-sensitive fixed income assets, such as fixed maturity
investments, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and
commercial mortgage loans, primarily in the United States and
Canada. There are two forms of interest rate risk —
price risk and reinvestment risk. Price risk occurs when
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the
market valuation of these investments. As interest rates rise,
the market value of these investments falls, and conversely, as
interest rates fall, the market value of these investments
rises. Reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest
rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from
mortgage-backed and asset-



backed securities. As interest rates fall, an increase in
prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected
receipt of cash flows forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an
unfavorable lower interest rate environment, and conversely as
interest rates rise, a decrease in prepayments on these assets
results in later than expected receipt of cash flows forcing us
to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate
environment. As of December 31, 2004, we held
$9,178 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market
value and $1,054 million of commercial mortgages at
amortized cost for a combined total of 84% of total invested
assets. As of December 31, 2003, we held
$8,729 million of fixed maturity securities at fair market
value and $933 million of commercial mortgages at amortized
cost for a combined total of 85% of total invested assets.

We expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments
with characteristics such as duration, yield, currency and
liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow
characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities.

Our group long-term disability reserves are also sensitive to
interest rates. Group long-term disability and group term life
waiver of premium reserves are discounted to the valuation date
at the valuation interest rate. The valuation interest rate is
determined by taking into consideration actual and expected
earned rates on our asset portfolio, with adjustments for
investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation.

The interest rate sensitivity of our fixed maturity security
assets is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume
several positive and negative parallel shifts of the underlying
yield curves. We have assumed that both the United States and
Canadian yield curves have a 100% correlation and, therefore,
move together. The individual securities are repriced under each
scenario using a valuation model. For investments such as
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, a prepayment model
was used in conjunction with a valuation model. Our actual
experience may differ from the results noted below particularly
due to assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not
included in the methodology. The following table summarizes the
results of this analysis for bonds, mortgage-backed and
asset-backed securities held in our investment portfolio:

Credit Risk

We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed
income securities and by entering into reinsurance cessions.

Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest
in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit
the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer. We
attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity
portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit
quality. Currently our portfolio limits are 1.5% for issuers
rated AA-and above, 1% for issuers rated A- to A+, 0.75% for
issuers rated BBB- to BBB+ and 0.38% for issuers rated BB- to
BB+. These portfolio limits are further reduced for certain
issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance
agreements. We use the lower of Moody’s or
Standard & Poor’s ratings to determine an
issuer’s rating. See “Item 1 —
Business — Investments.”

We are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers. When
we reinsure, we are still liable to our insureds regardless of
whether we get reimbursed by our reinsurer. As part of our
overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase
reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various
business segments as described above under
“— Reinsurance.”

For at least 50% of our $4,133 million of reinsurance
recoverables at December 31, 2004, we are protected from
the credit risk by using some type of risk mitigation mechanism
such as a trust, letter of credit or by withholding the assets
in a modified coinsurance or co-funds-withheld arrangement. For
example, reserves of $1,507 million and $882 million
as of December 31, 2004 relating to two large coinsurance
arrangements with The Hartford and John Hancock, respectively,
related to sales of businesses. If the value of the assets in
these trusts falls below the value of the associated
liabilities, The Hartford and John Hancock, as the case may be,
will be required to put more assets in the trusts. We may be
dependent on the financial condition of The Hartford and John
Hancock, whose A.M. Best ratings are currently A+ and A++,
respectively. For recoverables that are not protected by these
mechanisms, we are dependent solely on the credit of the
reinsurer. Occasionally, the credit worthiness of the reinsurer
becomes questionable. See “Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Risk Factors —
Risks Related to Our Company — Reinsurance may not be
available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are
subject to the credit risk of reinsurers.” We believe that
a majority of our reinsurance exposure has been ceded to
companies rated “A-“or better by A.M. Best.

Inflation Risk

Inflation risk arises as we invest substantial funds in nominal
assets, which are not indexed to the level of inflation, whereas
the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of
inflation. Approximately 12% of Assurant PreNeed’s
insurance policies with reserves of approximately
$398 million as of December 31, 2004 have death
benefits that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. In times of
rapidly rising inflation, the credited death benefit growth on
these liabilities increases relative to the investment income
earned on the nominal assets resulting in an adverse impact on
earnings. We have partially mitigated this risk by purchasing a
contract with payments tied to the CPI. See
“— Derivatives.”

In addition, we have inflation risk in our individual and small
employer group health insurance businesses to the extent that
medical costs increase with inflation, and we have not been able
to increase premiums to keep pace with inflation.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We are exposed to some foreign exchange risk arising from our
international operations mainly in Canada. We also have limited
foreign exchange risk exposure to currencies other than the
Canadian dollar, primarily the British pound and Danish krone.
Total invested assets denominated in these other currencies were
less than 2% of our total invested assets at December 31,
2004.

Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by matching our liabilities
under insurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies
with investments that are denominated in such currency. We have
not established any hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate
exposure.



Derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived
from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices
or the prices of securities or commodities. Derivative financial
instruments may be exchange-traded or contracted in the
over-the-counter market and include swaps, futures, options and
forward contracts.

Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use
derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated
changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market
instruments or for certain income-generating activities. These
statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for
speculative purposes. We generally do not use derivative
financial instruments.

On August 1, 2003, we purchased a contract to partially
hedge the inflation risk exposure inherent in some of our
pre-funded funeral insurance policies.

In 2003 we determined that the modified coinsurance agreement
with The Hartford contained an embedded derivative. In
accordance with DIG B36, we bifurcated the contract into its
debt host and embedded derivative (total return swap) and
recorded the embedded derivative at fair value on the balance
sheet. Contemporaneous with the adoption of DIG B36, we
reclassified the invested assets related to this modified
coinsurance agreement from fixed maturities available for sale
to trading securities, included in other investments in the
December 31, 2003 and 2004 consolidated balance sheet. The
combination of the two aforementioned transactions has no net
impact in the consolidated statements of operations for all
periods presented. See Note 2 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Assurant, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
the related statements of operations, of changes in
stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Assurant, Inc.
and its subsidiaries (formerly Fortis, Inc. and subsidiaries) at
December 31, 2004, and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion the accompanying financial
statement schedules present fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and the financial statements schedules are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Nature of Operations

Assurant, Inc. (formerly Fortis, Inc.) (the “Company”)
is a holding company provider of specialized insurance products
and related services in North America and selected international
markets. Prior to the Initial Public Offering (“the
IPO”) Fortis, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada and was
indirectly wholly owned by Fortis N.V. of the Netherlands and
Fortis SA/ NV of Belgium (collectively, “Fortis”)
through their affiliates, including their wholly owned
subsidiary, Fortis Insurance N.V. (see Note 12).

On February 5, 2004, Fortis sold approximately 65% of its
ownership interest in Assurant, Inc. via the IPO and retained
approximately 35% of its ownership (50,199,130 shares). In
connection with the IPO, Fortis, Inc. was merged into Assurant,
Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was formed solely for the
purpose of the redomestication of Fortis, Inc. After the merger,
Assurant, Inc. became the successor to the business, operations
and obligations of Fortis, Inc. Assurant, Inc. is traded on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AIZ.

The following events occurred in connection with the merger:
each share of the existing Class A Common Stock of Fortis,
Inc. was exchanged for 10.75882039 shares of Common Stock
of Assurant, Inc.; the automatic conversion of the shares of
Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock into an
aggregate of 25,841,418 shares of Common Stock of Assurant,
Inc.; each share of the existing Series B Preferred Stock
of Fortis, Inc. was exchanged for one share of Series B
Preferred Stock of Assurant, Inc.; each share of the existing
Series C Preferred Stock of Fortis, Inc. was exchanged for
one share of Series C Preferred Stock of Assurant, Inc..

The following events occurred in connection with the
Company’s IPO: (1) redeemed the outstanding $196,224
of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in January 2004
(see Note 8), (2) issued 68,976 shares of Common
Stock of Assurant, Inc. to certain officers of the Company, and
(3) issued 32,976,854 shares of Common Stock of
Assurant, Inc. to Fortis Insurance N.V. simultaneously with the
closing of the IPO in exchange for a $725,500 capital
contribution based on the public offering price of the
Company’s common stock. The Company used the proceeds of
the capital contribution to repay the $650,000 of outstanding
indebtedness under the $650,000 senior bridge credit facility
(see Note 9) and $75,500 of outstanding indebtedness under
the $1,100,000 senior bridge credit facility. The Company repaid
a portion of the $1,100,000 senior bridge credit facility with
$49,500 in cash. On February 18, 2004, the Company
refinanced $975,000 of the remaining $1,100,000 senior bridge
credit facility with the proceeds of the issuance of two senior
long-term notes. (see Note 9).

On January 21, 2005, Fortis owned approximately 36%
(50,199,130 shares) of the Company based on the number of
shares outstanding that day and sold 27,200,000 of those shares
in a secondary offering to the public. The Company did not
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock by Fortis. Fortis received all net proceeds from the sale.
Fortis concurrently sold exchangeable bonds, due
January 26, 2008, that are mandatorily exchangeable for
their remaining 22,999,130 shares of Assurant. Fortis may
elect, prior to the maturity date of the bonds, a cash
settlement alternative and pay the bondholders an amount of cash
equal to the applicable market value of the Company’s
common stock. The exchangeable bonds and the shares of the
Company’s common stock into which they are exchangeable
have not been and will not be registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States
absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration
requirements.

Through its operating subsidiaries, the Company provides
creditor-placed homeowners insurance, manufactured housing
homeowners insurance, debt protection administration, credit
insurance, warranties and extended service contracts, individual
health and small employer group health insurance, group dental
insurance, group disability insurance, group life insurance and
pre-funded funeral insurance.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates when recording
transactions resulting from business operations based on
information currently available. The most significant items on
the Company’s balance sheet that involve accounting
estimates and actuarial determinations are the value of business
acquired (“VOBA”), goodwill, reinsurance recoverables,
valuation of investments, deferred acquisition costs
(“DAC”), liabilities for future policy benefits and
expenses, taxes and claims and benefits payable. The accounting
estimates and actuarial determinations are sensitive to market
conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commissions
and other acquisition expenses, and terminations by
policyholders. As additional information becomes available or
actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates will be
revised and reflected in operating results. Although some
variability is inherent in these estimates, the Company believes
the amounts provided are reasonable and adequate.

Dollar amounts are presented in U.S. dollars and all
amounts are in thousands except for number of shares and per
share amounts.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant inter-company transactions and balances are
eliminated in consolidation. See Note 3 for dispositions of
businesses.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other
comprehensive income, which includes foreign currency
translation, unrealized gains and losses on securities
classified as available for sale and direct charges for
additional minimum pension liability, less deferred income taxes.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 2004 presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers cash on hand, all operating cash and
working capital cash to be cash equivalents. These amounts are
carried principally at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash
balances are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to
determine if negative cash balances exist. If negative cash
balances do exist, the cash accounts are netted with other
positive cash accounts of the same bank providing the right of
offset exists between the accounts. If the right of offset does
not exist, the negative cash balances are reclassified to
accounts payable.

Investments

The Company’s investment strategy is developed based on
many factors including appropriate insurance asset and liability
management, rate of return, maturity, credit risk, tax
considerations and regulatory requirements.

Fixed maturities and equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and reported at fair value. If the fair value
is higher than the amortized cost for debt securities or the
purchase cost for equity securities, the

F-7


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

excess is an unrealized gain; and if lower than cost, the
difference is an unrealized loss. The net unrealized gains and
losses, less deferred income taxes are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income.

Commercial mortgage loans on real estate are reported at unpaid
balances, adjusted for amortization of premium or discount, less
allowance for losses.

Policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances, which do
not exceed the cash surrender value of the underlying policies.

Short-term investments include all investment cash and short
maturity investments. These amounts are carried principally at
cost, which approximates fair value.

Other investments consist primarily of investments in joint
ventures, partnerships, invested assets associated with a
modified coinsurance arrangement and invested assets associated
with the Company’s Assurant Investment Plan
(“AIP”). The joint ventures and partnerships are
valued according to the equity method of accounting. The
invested assets related to a modified coinsurance arrangements
and the AIP are classified as trading securities and are
reported at fair value. Any changes in the fair value are
recorded as net realized gains and losses in the statement of
operations.

The Company regularly monitors its investment portfolio to
determine that investments that may be other than temporarily
impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued,
and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the
proper period. The Company’s methodology to identify
potential impairments requires professional judgment.

Changes in individual security values are monitored on a regular
basis in order to identify potential credit problems. In
addition, securities whose market price is equal to 85% or less
of their original purchase price are added to the impairment
watchlist, which is discussed at monthly meetings attended by
members of the Company’s investment, accounting and finance
departments. Any security whose price decrease is deemed
other-than-temporary is written down to its then current market
level with the amount of the writedown reflected as a realized
loss in the Statement of Operations for that period. Assessment
factors include, but are not limited to, the financial condition
and rating of the issuer, any collateral held and the length of
time the market value of the security has been below cost.

Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making
these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical
assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced
economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more
companies, industry sectors or countries could result in
additional write downs in future periods for impairments that
are deemed to be other-than-temporary.

Realized gains and losses on sales of investments and declines
in value judged to be other-than-temporary are recognized on the
specific identification basis.

Investment income is recorded as earned net of investment
expenses.

The Company anticipates prepayments of principal in the
calculation of the effective yield for mortgage-backed
securities and structured securities. The majority of the
Company’s mortgage-backed securities and structured
securities are of high credit quality. Therefore, the
retrospective method is used to adjust the effective yield.

Reinsurance

Reinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid
benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and
contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder
contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over
the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions
consistent with those used to account for the policies. Amounts
recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent
with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future
policy benefits reserves and are reported

F-8


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

in the consolidated balance sheets. The cost of reinsurance
related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the
life of the underlying reinsured policies. The ceding of
insurance does not discharge the Company’s primary
liability to insureds. An estimated allowance for doubtful
accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of
balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency,
management’s experience, and current economic conditions.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are
primarily related to the production of new business are deferred
to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future
premiums or gross profits. Acquisition costs primarily consist
of commissions, policy issuance expenses, and certain direct
marketing expenses.

Loss recognition testing is performed annually and reviewed
quarterly. Such testing involves the use of best estimate
assumptions including the anticipation of interest income to
determine if anticiapted future policy premiums are adequate to
recover all DAC and related claims, benfits and expenses. To the
extent a premium deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately
by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding
reduction in DAC. If the premium deficiency is greater than
unamortized DAC, a liability will be accrued for the excess
deficiency.

Short Duration Contracts

DAC relating to property contracts, warranty and extended
service contracts and single premium credit insurance contracts
is amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to
premiums earned.

Acquisition costs relating to monthly pay credit insurance
business consist mainly of direct marketing costs and are
deferred and amortized over the estimated average terms and
balances of the underlying contracts.

Acquisition costs relating to group term life, group disability
and group dental consist primarily of new business underwriting,
field sales support, commissions to agents and brokers, and
compensation to sales representatives. These acquisition costs
are front-end loaded; thus they are deferred and amortized over
the estimated terms of the underlying contracts.

Acquisition costs on individual medical contracts issued in most
jurisdictions after 2002 and small group medical consist
primarily of commissions to agents and brokers and compensation
to representatives. These contracts are considered short
duration because the terms of the contract are not fixed at
issue and they are not guaranteed renewable. As a result, these
costs are not deferred but rather they are recorded in the
consolidated statement of operations in the period in which they
are incurred.

Long Duration Contracts

Acquisition costs for pre-funded funeral life insurance policies
and life insurance policies no longer offered are deferred and
amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums over the
premium-paying period. These acquisition costs relate primarily
to commissions and marketing allowances.

For pre-funded funeral investment type annuities, universal life
insurance policies and investment-type annuities no longer
offered, DAC is amortized in proportion to the present value of
estimated gross margins or profits from investment, mortality,
expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of
the policy or contract. The assumptions used for the estimates
are consistent with those used in computing the policy or
contract liabilities.

Acquisition costs relating to individual medical contracts
issued prior to 2003 and currently in a limited number of
jurisdictions are deferred and amortized over the estimated
average terms of the underlying

F-9


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

contracts. These acquisition costs relate to commissions and
policy issuance expenses. Commissions represent the majority of
deferred costs and result from commission schedules that pay
significantly higher rates in the first year. The majority of
deferred policy issuance expenses are the costs of separately
underwriting each individual medical contract.

Acquisition costs on the Fortis Financial Group
(“FFG”) and Long-Term Care (“LTC”) disposed
businesses were written off when the businesses were sold.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line
basis over estimated useful lives with a maximum of
39.5 years for buildings, 7 years for furniture and
5 years for equipment. Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to income as incurred. Expenditures for
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining
useful life of the asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the net
fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination. The Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
(“FAS 142”),

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, as of January 1, 2002. Pursuant to
FAS 142, goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and
should not be amortized, but rather tested at least annually for
impairment. The goodwill impairment test has two steps. The
first identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair
value of a reporting unit with its book value, including
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and the second step is
not required. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the
second step calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing
the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. If
the implied goodwill is less than the carrying amount, a write
down is recorded. Prior to the adoption of FAS 142,
goodwill was amortized over 20 years. Upon the adoption of
FAS 142, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill, and
recognized a $1,260,939 impairment charge as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle. The measurement of
fair value was determined based on a valuation report prepared
by an independent valuation firm. The valuation was based on an
evaluation of ranges of future discounted earnings, public
company trading multiples and acquisitions of similar companies.
Certain key assumptions considered include forecasted trends in
revenues, operating expenses and effective tax rates. The
Company performs a goodwill impairment test annually and has not
recognized an impairment charge since adoption.

Value of Businesses Acquired

VOBA is the identifiable intangible asset representing the value
of the insurance businesses acquired. The amount is determined
using best estimates for mortality, lapse, maintenance expenses
and investment returns at date of purchase. The amount
determined represents the purchase price paid to the seller for
producing the business. Similar to the amortization of DAC, the
amortization of VOBA is over the premium payment period for
traditional life insurance policies and a small block of limited
payment policies. For the remaining limited payment policies,
pre-funded funeral life insurance policies, all universal life
policies and annuities, the amortization of VOBA is over the
expected lifetime of the policies.

VOBA is tested for recoverability annually. If it is determined
that future policy premiums and investment income or gross
profits are not adequate to cover related losses or loss
expenses, then VOBA is charged to current earnings.

F-10


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Separate Accounts

Assets and liabilities associated with separate accounts relate
to premium and annuity considerations for variable life and
annuity products for which the contract-holder, rather than the
Company, bears the investment risk. Separate account assets are
reported at fair value. Revenues and expenses related to the
separate account assets and liabilities, to the extent of
benefits paid or provided to the separate account policyholders,
are excluded from the amounts reported in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

Prior to April 2, 2001, FFG had issued variable insurance
products registered as securities under the Securities Act of
1933. These products featured fixed premiums, a minimum death
benefit, and policyholder returns linked to an underlying
portfolio of securities. The variable insurance products issued
by FFG have been 100% reinsured with The Hartford Financial
Services Group Inc. (“The Hartford”). The balance of
reserve ceded for the variable insurance products issued by FFG
was $1,507,228 and $1,536,568 as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Income Taxes

Current federal income taxes are charged to operations based
upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result
of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred income
taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and
liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates
applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary
differences to reverse. The Company would establish a valuation
allowance for any portion of the deferred tax assets that
management believes will not be realized. In the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that the Company will
realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets and, therefore,
no such valuation allowance has been established.

Other Assets

Other assets include prepaid items and intangible assets.
Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives, including
costs capitalized relating to developing software for internal
use, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives. The Company tests the intangible assets for
impairment whenever circumstances warrant, but at least
annually. If impairment exists, then excess of the unamortized
balance over the fair value of the intangible assets will be
charged to earnings at that time. Other assets also include the
Company’s approximately 38% interest in Private Health Care
Systems, Inc. (“PHCS”). The Company was a co-founder
of PHCS, a provider network, and increased its’ investment
in PHCS by 15% in 2004. The Company accounts for PHCS according
to the equity method.

Foreign Currency Translation

For those foreign affiliates where the foreign currency is the
functional currency, unrealized foreign exchange gains (losses)
net of income taxes have been reflected in Stockholders’
Equity under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive
income.”

Premiums

Short Duration Contracts

The Company’s short duration contracts are those on which
the Company recognizes revenue on a pro-rata basis over the
contract term. The Company’s short duration contracts
primarily include group term life, group disability, medical and
dental, property and warranty, credit life and disability, and
extended service contracts and individual medical contracts
after 2002 in most jurisdictions.

Long Duration Contracts

Currently, the Company’s long duration contracts being sold
are pre-funded funeral life insurance and investment type
annuities. The pre-funded funeral life insurance policies
include provisions for death benefit

F-11


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

growth that is either pegged to the changes in the Consumer
Price Index (the “CPI CAP”) or determined periodically
at the discretion of management. For pre-funded funeral life
insurance policies, revenues are recognized when due from
policyholders. For pre-funded funeral investment-type annuity
contracts, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy
balances.

For individual medical contracts sold prior to 2003, individual
medical contracts currently sold in a limited number of
jurisdictions and traditional life insurance contracts
previously sold by the PreNeed segment but no longer offered,
revenue is recognized when due from policyholders.

For universal life insurance and investment-type annuity
contracts previously sold by the Solutions segment but no longer
offered, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy
balances.

Premiums for LTC insurance and traditional life insurance
contracts within FFG are recognized as revenue when due from the
policyholder. For universal life insurance and investment-type
annuity contracts within FFG, revenues consist of charges
assessed against policy balances. For the FFG and LTC businesses
previously sold, all revenue is ceded to The Hartford and John
Hancock, respectively.

Reinsurance Assumed

Reinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based upon payments
received from ceding companies together with accrual estimates,
which are based on both payments received and in force policy
information received from ceding companies. Any subsequent
differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period
in which they are determined.

Fee Income

The Company primarily derives income from fees received from
providing administrative services. Fee income is earned when
services are performed.

Dealer obligor service contracts are sales in which the
retailer/dealer is designated as the obligor (administrative
service-only plans). For these contracts sales, the Company
recognizes administrative fee revenue on a straight pro-rata
basis over the terms of the service contract.

Administrator obligor service contracts are sales in which the
Company is designated as the obligor. For these contract sales,
the Company recognizes revenues in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin 90-1
(“TB 90-1”),

(“FAS 60”).
Administration fees related to these contracts are generally
recognized as earned on the same basis as the premium is
recognized or on a straight-line pro-rata basis. Administration
fees related to the unexpired portion of the contract term are
deferred. Acquisition costs related to these contracts are also
deferred. Both the deferred administration fees and acquisition
costs are amortized over the term of the contracts. Deferred
administration fees at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
were $49,701, $27,328, and $28,845, respectively. Amortization
income recognized in fees and other income for 2004, 2003 and
2002 as $28,827, $23,183 and $26,463, respectively.

Reserves

Reserves are established according to GAAP, using generally
accepted actuarial methods and are based on a number of factors.
These factors include experience derived from historical claim
payments and actuarial assumptions to arrive at loss development
factors. Such assumptions and other factors include trends, the
incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims
have been reported, and internal claims processing charges. The
process used in computing reserves cannot be exact, particularly
for liability coverages, since actual claim costs are dependent
upon such complex factors as inflation, changes in doctrines of
legal liabilities and damage awards. The methods of making such
estimates and establishing the related liabilities are
periodically reviewed and updated.

Short Duration Contracts

For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable
reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability
is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims.
The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case
reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet
date; (2) incurred but not reported (“IBNR”)
reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has
not been reported to the Company as of the balance sheet date;
and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected
handling costs of settling the claims.

For group disability, the case reserves and the IBNR are
recorded at an amount equal to the net present value of the
expected claims future payments. Group long-term disability and
group term life waiver of premiums reserves are discounted to
the valuation date at the valuation interest rate. The valuation
interest rate is reviewed quarterly by taking into consideration
actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio, with
adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse
deviation. Group long term disability and group term life
reserve adequacy studies are performed annually, and morbidity
and mortality assumptions are adjusted where appropriate.

Unearned premium reserves are maintained for the portion of the
premiums on short duration contracts that is related to the
unexpired period of the policies.

The Company has exposure to asbestos, environmental and other
general liability claims arising from its participation in
various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1983. This exposure
arose from a short duration contract that the company
discontinued writing many years ago. The Company carried case
reserves for these liabilities as recommended by the various
pool managers and bulk reserves for claims incurred but not yet
reported of $49,968 (before reinsurance) and $38,905 (after
reinsurance) in the aggregate at December 31, 2004. Any
estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than
normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of
sufficient detailed data, reporting delays, and absence of
generally accepted actuarial methodology for determining the
exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal
issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what
constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of
ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to
financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

Long Duration Contracts

Future policy benefits and expense reserves on LTC, life
insurance policies and annuity contracts that are no longer
offered, individual medical policies issued prior to 2003 or
issued in a limited number of jurisdictions and the traditional
life insurance contracts within FFG are recorded at the present
value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related
expenses less the present value of the future net premiums.
These amounts are estimated and include assumptions as to the
expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity and
withdrawal rates as well as other assumptions that are based on
the Company’s experience. These assumptions reflect
anticipated trends and include provisions for possible
unfavorable deviations.

Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre-funded
funeral investment-type annuities, universal life insurance
policies and investment-type annuity contracts no longer
offered, and the variable life insurance and investment-type
annuity contracts in FFG consist of policy account balances
before applicable surrender charges and certain deferred policy
initiation fees that are being recognized in income over the
terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged to expense during
the period include amounts paid in excess of policy account
balances and interest credited to policy account balances.

Future policy benefits and expense reserves for pre-funded
funeral life insurance contracts are recorded as the present
value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses
less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve
assumptions are selected using best estimates for expected
investment yield, inflation, mortality and withdrawal rates.
These assumptions reflect current trends, are based on Company
experience and include provision for possible unfavorable
deviation. An unearned revenue reserve is also recorded for

Notes to Consolidated Financial

these contracts which represents the balance of the excess of
gross premiums over net premiums that is still to be recognized
in future years’ income in a constant relationship to
insurance in force.

Changes in the estimated liabilities are charged or credited to
operations as the estimates are revised.

Business Combinations

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141,

Business Combinations

(“FAS 141”), which requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting and establishes specific
criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately
from goodwill.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“the FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“FAS 149”). This statement amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for
hedging activities under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities

. This Statement is effective
prospectively for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003 and prospectively for hedging relationships
designated after June 30, 2003. The Company has assessed
that the adoption of this standard did not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial position or the results
of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 150,

Accounting For Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

(“FAS 150”). This statement improves the
accounting for certain financial instruments that, under
previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity, and
requires that these instruments be classified as liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheets. This statement is effective
prospectively for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. This statement shall be implemented by
reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting
principle for financial instruments created before the issuance
date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the
interim period of adoption. The Company has adopted this
standard and has reclassified mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts and mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock from mezzanine to liabilities.

On July 7, 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee (“AcSEC”) of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued
Statement of Position 03-1,

Accounting and Reporting by
Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration
Contracts and for Separate Accounts

(“SOP 03-1”).
SOP 03-1 provides guidance on a number of topics unique to
insurance enterprises, including separate account presentation,
interest in separate accounts, gains and losses on the transfer
of assets from the general account to a separate account,
liability valuation, returns based on a contractually referenced
pool of assets or index, accounting for contracts that contain
death or other insurance benefit features, accounting for
reinsurance and other similar contracts, accounting for
annuitization benefits and sales inducements to contract
holders. SOP 03-1 effective for the Company’s financial
statements on January 1, 2004. The Company assessed this
statement and determined that the adoption of this statement did
not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position or the results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 132 (Revised 2003),

Employers’ Disclosure about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits

(“FAS 132” — Revised 2003). This
statement revises employers’ disclosure about pension plans
and other postretirement benefit plans. This statement does not
change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by
Statement of

F-14


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial

Financial Accounting Standards No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

, No. 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlement and Curtailments of
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits

,
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,

Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions

. This statement retains the disclosure
requirements contained in FAS 132, Employers’
Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,
which it replaces. It requires additional disclosure to that
found in FAS 132 about the assets, obligations, cash flows,
and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans
and other defined benefit postretirement plans and was effective
for fiscal year ending after December 15, 2003. The Company
fully adopted this statement. See Note 18.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
reached a final consensus on Issue 03-1,

“The
Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application
to Certain Investments”

(“EITF 03-1”).
EITF 03-1 provides guidance on the disclosure requirements
for other than temporary impairments of debt and marketable
equity investments that are accounted for under Financial
Accounting Standard 115 (“FAS 115”).
EITF 03-1 also provides guidance for evaluating whether an
investment is other than temporarily impaired. The adoption of
EITF 03-1 required the Company to include certain
quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable
equity securities classified as available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity under FAS 115 that are impaired at the
balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary
impairment has not been recognized. The disclosures were
effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2003. The Company adopted the disclosure
requirements of EITF 03-1 at December 31, 2003. The
guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than
temporarily impaired is effective for reporting periods
beginning after June 15, 2004; however, the FASB issued two
new proposed Staff Positions. EITF 03-1a which would defer
the June 15, 2004 effective date of the requirement to
record impairment losses caused by the effect of increases in
interest rates or sector spreads on debt securities subject to
paragraph 16 of EITF 03-1 until further guidance is
provided and EITF 03-1b, which would exclude minor
impairments from the requirement. Both Staff Positions are still
in the comment period phase. The Company is continuing to
evaluate the impact of adoption of this issue given the fact
that portions of the issue are still in the comment period. The
Company currently follows the guidance on other than temporary
impairments provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) 59,

Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable
Equity Securities.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) FAS 106-2,

Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

(“FAS 106-2”), which provides guidance on
accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“the Act”).
The Act introduces (1) a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare and (2) a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree
health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least “actuarially equivalent” to Medicare
Part D. The FASB concluded that the subsidy should be
treated as an actuarial gain pursuant to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106,

Employers’ Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

(“FAS 106”). FAS 106-2 is effective for
the first interim period or annual period beginning after
June 15, 2004. Since the effects of the Act were not
considered a significant event, the effects of the Act were
incorporated in the next measurement of plan assets and
obligations, December 31, 2004. The Company believes that
it will be entitled to the subsidy. The adoption of this
statement did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or the results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
Payment

(“FAS 123R” — Revised 2003)
which replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

FAS 123R
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants
of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values beginning with the first
interim period after June 15, 2005. The pro forma
disclosures previously permitted under FAS 123 no longer
will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. The
Company is required to adopt FAS 123R by the third quarter
of 2005. Under FAS 123R, the company must determine the
appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based
payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the
transition method

F-15


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

to be used at date of adoption. The permitted transition methods
include either retrospective or prospective adoption. Under the
retrospective option, prior periods may be restated either as of
the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods
presented. The prospective method requires that compensation
expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the
beginning of the first quarter of adoption of FAS 123R,
while the retrospective methods would record compensation
expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first
period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the
requirements of FAS 123R. The Company has not yet
determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting
FAS 123R. See stock-based compensation plans in Note 4.

In February 2005, the EITF issued EITF Issue 04-8,

The
Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted
Earnings per Share

(“EITF 04-8”).
EITF 04-8 was effective for periods ending after
December 15, 2004 and requires certain contingently
convertible instruments be included in diluted earnings per
share. The adoption of EITF 04-8 did not change the methods
of or results of the calculation of the Company’s earnings
per share.

Stock Based Compensation

2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan

The 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizes the granting of
awards to employees, officers, and directors. There are
10,000,000 shares reserved and available for issuance under
this plan. Upon closing of the IPO, the Company issued 68,976
restricted shares of Common Stock of Assurant, Inc. to certain
officers and directors of the Company. The Board of Directors
received 9,546 of those shares, which are fully vested. The
remaining 59,430 shares have a three year vesting period
and are expensed over the vesting period. The Company, in
accounting for the restricted shares, set up a contra equity
account called “Unamortized Restricted Stock
Compensation” in the stockholders’ equity section of
the balance sheet for $1,553. The $1,553 will be expensed over
the vesting period of the shares. The expense recorded for the
year ended December 31, 2004 was $945.

Executive 401K Plan

The Executive 401K Plan is offered to employees who meet certain
eligibility requirements. The requirements include being
regularly scheduled to work 20 or more hours per week, having
completed one year of service, and earning eligible pay in
excess of the IRS limits ($205,000 for 2004). The Company
contributes an amount equal to 7% of an employee’s eligible
pay in excess of the IRS limit to the plan. This expense is not
material to the Company’s financial statements. No employee
contribution is permitted to the plan. Employees are 100% vested
in these contributions after a three year vesting period.
Employees who are vested receive their account balance in cash
upon termination of their employment.

Effective May 18, 2004, the Company added an “Assurant
Stock Fund” to the plan’s investment option. During
2004, the Company purchased 33,626 Treasury shares for $842 via
a Rabbi Trust which was allocated to the Assurant Stock Fund.
See Note 13 for further information.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”) which went into effect on July 1, 2004.
The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the
Company’s stock at a 10% discount with funds contributed
through payroll deductions. Participants can contribute 1% to
15% of their base compensation to purchase Company shares up to
a maximum of $6,000 per offering period. There are two
offering periods during the year (January 1 through June 30
and July 1 through December 31). Shares are purchased
at the end of the offering period at 90% of the lower of the
closing price of Company’s stock on the first or last day
of the offering period. Participants must be employed on the
last day of the offering period in order to purchase Company
shares under the ESPP.

The ESPP is offered to individuals who are scheduled to work at
least 20 hours per week and at least five months per year,
have been continuously employed for at least six months by the
start of the offering period, not temporary employees (employed
less than 12 months), and have not been on a leave of
absence for more than 90 days immediately preceding the
offering period.

In January 2005, the Company issued 71,860 shares to
employees relating to the ESPP at a price of $23.67 for the
offering period of July 1 through December 31, 2004.

The Company accounts for the ESPP in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees”

(“APB 25”),
and accordingly does not record any compensation expense. The
following pro forma information of net income and net income per
share amounts were determined as if the Company had accounted
for the ESPP under the fair value method of FAS 123.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

The investment category and duration of the Company’s gross
unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities at
December 31, 2004 were as follows:

The total unrealized losses represent less than 2% of the
aggregate fair value of the related securities. Approximately
77% of these unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss
position for less than twelve months. The total unrealized
losses are comprised of 474 individual securities with 92% of
the individual securities having an unrealized loss of less than
$100. The total unrealized losses on securities that were in a
continuous unrealized loss position for longer than six months
but less than 12 months were approximately $7,872 with no
security with a book value of greater than $1,000 having a
market value below 86% of book value.

As part of the Company’s ongoing monitoring process, the
Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to ensure
that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are
identified on a timely basis and that any impairment is charged
against earnings in the proper period. The Company has reviewed
these securities and concluded that there were no additional
other than temporary impairments as of December 31, 2004.
Due to issuers’ continued satisfaction of the
securities’ obligations in accordance with their
contractual terms and their continued expectations to do so, as
well as the Company’s evaluation of the fundamentals of the
issuers’ financial condition, the Company believes that the
securities in an unrealized loss status are not impaired and
intends to hold them until recovery.

The Company has made commercial mortgage loans, collateralized
by the underlying real estate, on properties located throughout
the United States. At December 31, 2004, approximately 41%
of the outstanding principal balance of commercial mortgage
loans was concentrated in the states of California, New York,
and Pennsylvania. Although the Company has a diversified loan
portfolio, an economic downturn could have an adverse impact on
the ability of its debtors to repay their loans. The outstanding
balance of commercial mortgage loans range in size from $27 to
$12,962 at December 31, 2004. The mortgage loan valuation
allowance for losses, was $17,955 and $18,854 at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

At December 31, 2004, loan commitments outstanding totaled
approximately $32,300. Furthermore, at December 31, 2004,
the Company is committed to fund additional capital
contributions of $14,549 to joint ventures and $14,155 to
certain investments in limited partnerships.

The Company has short term investments and fixed maturities
carried at $676,583 and $560,794 at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, on deposit with various governmental
authorities as required by law.

Security Lending

The Company engages in transactions in which fixed maturities,
especially bonds issued by the United States Government,
agencies, and U.S. Corporations, are loaned to selected
broker/ dealers. Collateral, greater than or equal to 102% of
the fair value of the securities lent plus accrued interest, is
received in the form of cash held by a custodian bank for the
benefit of the Company. The Company monitors the fair value of
securities loaned and the collateral received, with additional
collateral obtained as necessary. The Company is subject to the
risk of loss to the extent there is a loss in the investment of
cash collateral. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, securities
with a fair value of $516,778 and $417,533, respectively, were
on loan to select brokers and are included in the Company’s
sale available for sale investments. At December 31, 2004
and 2003, collateral with a fair value of $535,331 and $420,783,
respectively, is included in the Company’s assets with
offsetting liabilities. The Company had a revision on
classification in the 2003 balance sheet to reflect the
collateral held under securities lending.

“1997 Common Securities I”) to the Company, in each
case with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per security.
Fortis Capital Trust used the proceeds from the sale of the 1997
Capital Securities I and the 1997 Common Securities I to
purchase $154,640 of the Company’s 8.40% junior
subordinated debentures due 2027 (the “1997 Junior
Subordinated Debentures I”). These debentures are the sole
assets of Fortis Capital Trust.

In July 1997, Fortis Capital Trust II, a trust declared and
established by the Company and other parties, issued 50,000
7.94% capital securities (the “1997 Capital
Securities II” and, together with the 1997 Capital
Securities, the “1997 Capital Securities”) to
purchasers and 1,547 7.94% common securities (the “1997
Common Securities II”) to the Company, in each case
with a liquidation amount of $1,000 per security. Fortis
Capital Trust II used the proceeds from the sale of the
1997 Capital Securities II and the 1997 Common
Securities II to purchase $51,547 of the Company’s
7.94% junior subordinated debentures due 2027 (the “1997
Junior Subordinated Debentures II” and, together with
the 1997 Junior Subordinated Debentures I, the “1997
Junior Subordinated Debentures”). These debentures are the
sole assets of Fortis Capital Trust II.

In early January 2004, the Company redeemed 100% of the
outstanding $196,224 of 1997 Capital Securities. In December
2003 the Company sent an irrevocable notice of redemption for
the 1997 capital securities; therefore, the Company accrued
interest premiums of $66,734 in 2003. The interest premiums are
included in the interest premiums on redemption of mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities line in the statement of
operations. See Note 1 – for further detail on
the extinguishment of these securities.

Debt

In December 2003, the Company entered into two senior bridge
credit facilities of $650,000 and $1,100,000. The aggregate
indebtedness of $1,750,000 under the facility was in connection
with the extinguishment of the Company’s Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Securities. See Note 8 for a detail
description of these securities and the repayment terms. The
$1,750,000 aggregate indebtedness under the senior bridge credit
facility was paid in full in January 2004.

In February 2004, the Company issued two series of senior notes
with an aggregate principal amount of $975,000. The Company
received net proceeds from this transaction of $971,537, which
represents the principal amount less the discount. The discount
will be amortized over the life of the notes. The first series
is $500,000 in principal amount, bears interest at
5.63% per year and is payable in a single installment due
February 15, 2014 and was issued at a 0.11% discount. The
second series is $475,000 in principal amount, bears interest at
6.75% per year and is payable in a single installment due
February 15, 2034 and was issued at a 0.61% discount.
Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on
February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing
August 15, 2004. The senior notes are unsecured obligations
and rank equally with all of

F-22


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

the Company’s other senior unsecured indebtedness. The
senior notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The Company
filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933
on May 4, 2004 to permit the exchange of the senior notes
for registered notes having identical terms. This registration
statement was declared effective on May 12, 2004. The
exchange offer expired on June 15, 2004 and all of the
holders exchanged their notes for the new, registered notes.

The interest expense incurred for the year ended
December 31, 2004 relating to the senior notes was $52,163.

In March 2004, the Company established a $500,000 commercial
paper program, which is available for working capital and other
general corporate purposes. The Company’s subsidiaries do
not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities at
their level. This program is backed up by a $500,000 senior
revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks arranged by
Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets,
Inc., which was established on January 30, 2004. The
revolving credit facility is unsecured and is available until
February 2007, so long as the Company is in compliance with all
the covenants. This facility is also available for general
corporate purposes, but to the extent used thereto, would be
unavailable to back up the commercial paper program. On
June 1, 2004, August 9, 2004, and October 18,
2004 the Company used $20,000, $40,000, and $40,000,
respectively, from the commercial paper program for general
corporate purposes, which was repaid on June 15, 2004,
August 20, 2004, and October 29, 2004, respectively.
There were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program
outstanding at December 31, 2004. The Company did not use
the revolving credit facility during the year ended
December 31, 2004 and no amounts are currently outstanding.

The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants.
The terms of the revolving credit facility also require that the
Company maintain certain specified minimum ratio and thresholds.
The Company is in compliance with all covenants and the Company
maintains all specified minimum ratios and thresholds.

Income Taxes

The Company and the majority of its subsidiaries are subject to
U.S. tax and file a U.S. consolidated federal income
tax return. Information about current and deferred tax expense
follows:

The provision for foreign taxes includes amounts attributable to
income from U.S. possessions that are considered foreign
under U.S. tax laws. International operations of the
Company are subject to income taxes imposed by the jurisdiction
in which they operate.

Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

A reconciliation of the federal income tax rate to the
Company’s effective income tax rate follows:

In December 2004, pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (“Jobs Act”), the Company repatriated $110,066
from its Puerto Rico subsidiaires and incurred $18,887 of tax
expense. In accordance with proposed tax legislation, the
Company anticipates that $5,300 of this expense will be
recaptured as a tax benefit when the proposed legislation
becomes enacted. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2004,
an analysis of our Federal Tax Liability resulted in a $10,000
reduction of our tax liability.

The tax effects of temporary differences that result in
significant deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
as follows:

Deferred taxes have not been provided on the undistributed
earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, including the
Puerto Rico subsidiaries, since the Company intends to
indefinitely reinvest these earnings. The cumulative amount of
undistributed earnings for which the Company has not provided
deferred income taxes

F-24


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

is approximately $71,600. Upon distribution of such earnings in
a taxable event, the Company would incur additional
U.S. income taxes of approximately $19,400 net of
anticipated foreign tax credits.

Under pre-1984 life insurance company income tax laws, a portion
of a life insurance company’s “gain from
operations” was not subject to current income taxation but
was accumulated, for tax purposes, in a memorandum account
designated as “policyholders’ surplus account.”
Amounts in this account only become taxable upon the occurrence
of certain events. The approximate amount in this account was
$95,200 at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Deferred taxes have
not been provided on amounts in this acccount since the Company
neither comtemplates any action nor foresees any events occuring
that would create such tax. The Company anticipates designating
dividends in the amount of $95,200 over the next two years to be
taken from this account. In accordance with the Jobs Act, there
will be no federal income tax on these amounts.

At December 31, 2004, the Company and its subsidiaries had
capital loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Capital loss carryforwards total $40,183 and will
expire if unused as follows:

All shares have a liquidation price of $1,000 per share and
rank senior to common stock with respect to rights to receive
dividends and to receive distributions upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company.

Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to
receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 4.0% per share
per annum, multiplied by the $1,000 per share liquidation
price, and holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are
entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 4.5% per share
per annum multiplied by the $1,000 per share liquidation
price. All dividends are payable in arrears on a quarterly
basis. Any dividend that is not paid on a specified dividend
payment date with respect to a share of such Preferred Stock
shall be deemed added to the liquidation price of such share for
purposes of computing the future dividends on such share, until
such delinquent dividend has been paid.

Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock may elect to have
any or all of their shares redeemed by the Company at any time
after April 1, 2002, and the Company must redeem all shares
of the Series B Preferred Stock no later than July 1,
2017. Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock may elect to
have any or all of their shares redeemed by the Company any time
after April 1, 2022, and the Company must redeem all shares
of the Series C Preferred Stock no later than July 1,
2027. The Company also has the right and the obligation to
redeem the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain specified events.
The redemption price in all cases shall equal the
$1,000 per share liquidation price plus all accumulated and
unpaid dividends. The Company is not required to establish any
sinking fund or similar funds with respect to such redemptions.
None of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock or
Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into common stock
or any other equity security of the Company. However, holders of
the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock are entitled to one vote per share owned of record on all
matters voted upon by the Company stockholders, voting with the
holders of common stock as a single class, and not as a separate
class or classes. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock
and Series C Preferred Stock are subject to certain
restrictions on transferability, and the Company has the right
of first refusal to acquire the shares if any holder thereof
desires to make a transfer not otherwise permitted by the terms
thereof.

Statutory Information

The Company’s insurance subsidiaries prepare financial
statements on the basis of statutory accounting practices
(“SAP”) prescribed or permitted by the insurance
departments of their states of domicile. Prescribed SAP includes
the Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as
well as state laws, regulations and administrative rules.

The principal differences between SAP and GAAP are: 1) policy
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred under SAP, but are
deferred and amortized under GAAP; 2) the value of business
acquired is not capitalized under SAP but is under GAAP;
3) amounts collected from holders of universal life-type
and annuity products are recognized as premiums when collected
under SAP, but are initially recorded as contract deposits under
GAAP, with cost of insurance recognized as revenue when assessed
and other contract charges recognized over the periods for which
services are provided; 4) the classification and carrying
amounts of investments in certain securities are different under
SAP than under GAAP; 5) the criteria for providing asset
valuation allowances, and the methodologies used to determine
the amounts thereof, are different under SAP than under GAAP;
6) the timing of establishing certain reserves, and the
methodologies used to determine the amounts thereof, are
different under SAP than under GAAP; 7) certain assets are
not admitted for purposes of determining surplus under SAP;
8) methodologies used to determine the amounts of deferred
taxes and

F-27


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

goodwill are different under SAP than under GAAP; and
9) the criteria for obtaining reinsurance accounting
treatment is different under SAP than under GAAP.

The combined statutory net income and capital and surplus of the
insurance subsidiaries follow:

Insurance enterprises are required by state insurance
departments to adhere to minimum risk-based capital
(“RBC”) requirements developed by the NAIC. All of the
Company’s insurance subsidiaries exceed minimum RBC
requirements.

The payment of dividends to the Company by the Company’s
insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e.,
extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the
subsidiaries’ domiciliary state department of insurance.
Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is
generally required, are limited to amounts determined by
formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of
the states in which the Company’s subsidiaries are
domiciled is the lesser of (i) 10% of the statutory surplus
as of the end of the prior year or (ii) the prior
year’s statutory net income. In some states the formula is
the greater amount of clauses (i) and (ii). Some states,
however, have an additional stipulation that dividends may only
be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine
that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by
the Company’s insurance subsidiaries to the Company (such
as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for
employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or
creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would
otherwise be permitted without prior approval. As part of the
regulatory approval process for the acquisition of American
Bankers Insurance Group (“ABIG”) in 1999, the Company
entered into an agreement with the Florida Insurance Department
pursuant to which American Bankers Insurance Company and
American Bankers Life Assurance Company have agreed to limit the
amount of ordinary dividends they would pay to the Company to an
amount no greater than 50% of the amount otherwise permitted
under Florida law. This agreement expired in August 2004. In
addition, the Company entered into an agreement with the New
York Insurance Department as part of the regulatory approval
process for the merger of Bankers American Life Assurance
Company, one of the Company’s New York-domiciled insurance
subsidiaries, into First Fortis Life Insurance Company
(“FFLIC”) in 2001, pursuant to which FFLIC agreed not
to pay any dividends to the Company until fiscal year 2004. No
assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory
actions restricting the ability of the Company’s insurance
subsidiaries to pay dividends. Based on the dividend
restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the maximum
amount of dividends that the Company’s subsidiaries could
pay to the Company in 2005 without regulatory approval is
approximately $364,000.

Reinsurance

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in
both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with
non-affiliated companies. The following table provides details

The effect of reinsurance on premiums earned and benefits
incurred was as follows:

The Company had $676,136 and $624,044, respectively, of invested
assets held in trusts or by custodians as of December 31,
2004 and 2003 for the benefit of others related to certain
reinsurance arrangements.

The Company utilizes ceded reinsurance for loss protection and
capital management, business dispositions, and in the
Solutions’ segment, for client risk and profit sharing.

Loss Protection and Capital Management

As part of the Company’s overall risk and capacity
management strategy, the Company purchases reinsurance for
certain risks underwritten by the Company’s various
segments, including significant individual or catastrophic
claims, and to free up capital to enable the Company to write
additional business.

For those product lines where there is exposure to catastrophes,
the Company closely monitors and manages the aggregate risk
exposure by geographic area and the Company has entered into
reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events.

Under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which the Company is
the ceding insurer, the Company remains liable for policy claims
if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations. To limit
this risk, the Company has control procedures in place to
evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor
the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. The
selection of reinsurance companies is based on

F-29


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

criteria related to solvency and reliability and, to a lesser
degree, diversification as well as on developing strong
relationships with the Company’s reinsurers for the sharing
of risks.

Business Divestitures

The Company has used reinsurance to exit certain businesses,
such as the disposals of FFG and LTC. Reinsurance was used in
these cases to facilitate the transactions because the
businesses shared legal entities with business segments that the
Company retained. Assets backing liabilities ceded related to
these businesses are held in trusts for the benefit of the
Company and the separate accounts relating to FFG are still
reflected in the Company’s balance sheet.

The reinsurance recoverable from The Hartford was $1,507,228 and
$1,536,568 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The reinsurance recoverable from John Hancock was $882,394 and
$873,477 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The Company would be responsible for administering this business
in the event of a default by reinsurers. In addition, under the
reinsurance agreement, The Hartford is obligated to contribute
funds to increase the value of the separate account assets
relating to Modified Guaranteed Annuity business sold if such
value declines below the value of the associated liabilities. If
The Hartford fails to fulfill these obligations, the Company
will be obligated to make these payments. As of
December 31, 2004 there have been no default events by The
Hartford or John Hancock and the Company has not been obligated
to fulfill any of the reinsurers’ obligations.

Solutions’ Segment Client Risk and Profit
    Sharing

The Assurant Solutions segment writes business produced by its
clients, such as mortgage lenders and servicers and financial
institutions, and reinsures all or a portion of such business to
insurance subsidiaries of the clients. Such arrangements allow
significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and
profits on the underlying business.

A substantial portion of Assurant Solutions’ reinsurance
activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums
generated by certain clients to the clients’ own captive
insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the
clients have an ownership interest. Collateral is generally
obtained in amounts equal to the outstanding reserves when
captive companies are not authorized to operate in the
Company’s insurance subsidiary’s state of domicile as
required by statutory accounting principles.

The Company’s reinsurance agreements do not relieve the
Company from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a
credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is
unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance
agreements. To minimize its exposure to reinsurance
insolvencies, the Company evaluates the financial condition of
its reinsurers and holds substantial collateral (in the form of
funds, trusts, and letters of credit) as security under the
reinsurance agreements.

The following table provides a roll forward of the claims and
benefits payable for the Company’s group term life, group
disability, medical and property and warranty lines of business.
These are the Company’s product lines with the most
significant short duration claims and benefits payable balances.
The majority of the Company’s credit life and disability
claims and benefits payable are ceded to reinsurers. The
Company’s net retained credit life and disability claims
and benefits payable were $156,968, $129,406 and $134,715 at
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The “other” in reinsurance ceded and other included
    $13,300 in 2002 of liability balances primarily related to
    Medical Savings Accounts. In 2003 Medical Savings Accounts were
    transferred to an external third party administrator.

The claims and benefits payable include claims in process as
well as provisions for incurred but not reported claims. Such
amounts are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions
that consider, among other things, contractual requirements,
historical utilization trends and payment patterns, benefits
changes, medical inflation, seasonality, membership, product
mix, legislative and regulatory environment, economic factors,
disabled life mortality and claim termination rates and other
relevant factors. The Company consistently applies the
principles and assumptions listed above from year to year, while
also giving due consideration to the potential variability of
these factors.

Because claims and benefits payable include estimates developed
from various actuarial methods, the Company’s actual losses
incurred may be more or less than the Company’s previously
developed estimates. As shown in the table above, for each of
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 the
amounts listed on the line labeled “Incurred losses related
to: Prior year” are negative (redundant) for the Group
Term Life and Medical lines of business. This means that the
Company’s actual losses incurred related to prior years for
these lines were less than the estimates previously made by the
Company. For Group Disability, the amounts listed are negative
(redundant) for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2002, and positive (deficient) for the year ended
December 31, 2003. This means that for 2004 and 2002, the
Company’s actual losses incurred related to prior years for
this line were less than what was estimated, while for 2003,
actual losses incurred related to prior years were greater than
what was previously estimated by the Company. For Property and
Warranty, the amounts listed are negative (redundant) for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, and positive
(deficient) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This
means for 2004 and 2003, the Company’s losses incurred
related to prior years for this line were less than expected,
while for 2002, actual losses incurred related to prior year
were greater than what was previously estimated by the Company.

The Group Term Life reserve redundancy in 2003, and its related
downward revision primarily reflects the results of reserves
adequacy studies conducted in the third quarter of 2003. Based
on the results of those studies, reserves were reduced by
$59,000. The change in estimate reflects an increase in the
discount rate, lower mortality rates and higher recovery rates.
These changes were made to reflect current yields on invested
assets, and recent mortality and recovery experience. In 2004
and 2002 the Group Term Life reserve redundancies were caused by
actual mortality rates being lower than assumed in our
beginning-of-year reserves and recovery rates being higher than
assumed in our beginning-of-year waiver of premium reserves. The
remaining redundancy and related downward revision was due to
shorter-than-expected lags between incurred claim dates and paid
claim dates. These amounts were offset by one less year of
discounting reflected in the Company’s end-of-year waiver
of premium reserves.

The Group Disability reserve deficiency in 2003, and its related
upward revision reflects the result of reserve adequacy studies
concluded in the third quarter of 2003. Based on the results of
those studies, reserves were increased by $44,000, almost all of
which was attributable to a reduction in the discount rate to
reflect current yields on invested assets. The Group Disability
reserve redundancies in 2004 and 2002, which were less than 1%
of prior year reserves, arose as a result of our actual claim
recovery rates exceeding those assumed in our beginning-of-year
case reserves, after taking into account an offset of one less
year of discounting reflected in the Company’s end-of-year
case reserves.

The conclusion of the 2003 reserve studies determined that, in
the aggregate, the reserves were redundant. The reserve discount
rate on all claims was changed to reflect the continuing low
interest rate environment. The net impact of these adjustments
was a reduction in reserves of approximately $18,000, which
includes $3,000 of reserve release relating to the group dental
business.

The redundancies in our Medical line of business, and the
related downward revisions in the Company’s Medical reserve
estimates, were caused by the Company’s claims developing
more favorably than expected. The Company’s actual claims
experience reflected lower medical provider utilization and
lower medical inflation than assumed in the Company’s
prior-year pricing and reserving processes.

The Company’s Property and Warranty lines of business had a
small deficiency in 2002 which was largely attributable to a
shift in the mix of business away from the credit property and
unemployment product lines. In addition, an increase in the
claim frequency of unemployment contributed to additional
development on the small deficiency experienced in 2002. In
2003, unemployment claim frequencies stabilized, contributing to
a modest redundancy. In 2004, an improved economic environment
led to lower unemployment levels, which meant that loss payments
on existing claims as well as payments on new claims in our
credit unemployment lines, were not as high as would have been
expected. This, coupled with lower reserve levels as a result of
reduced premium writings in this line, led to a redundancy.
These changes reflect experience gains and losses from actual
claim frequencies differing from best estimate claim
frequencies, and difference in actual versus best estimate paid
claim lag rates.

For the longer-tail Property and Warranty coverages (e.g.
asbestos, environmental, other general liability and personal
accident), there were no material changes in estimated amounts
for incurred claims in prior years for all years.

Long Duration Contracts

The Company’s long duration contracts are comprised of
pre-funded funeral life insurance policies and annuity
contracts, traditional life insurance policies no longer
offered, universal life and annuities no longer offered and FFG
and LTC disposed businesses. The principal products and services
included in these categories are described in the summary of
significant accounting polices (see Note 2).

The Company’s PreNeed segment distributes pre-funded
funeral insurance products through two separate divisions, the
independent division and the AMLIC division. The reserves for
future policy benefits

Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

and expenses for pre-funded funeral life and annuity contracts
and traditional life insurance no longer offered by the PreNeed
segment differ by division and are established based upon the
following assumptions:

PreNeed Segment — Independent Division

Interest and discount rates for pre-funded funeral life
insurance are level, vary by year of issuance and product, and
ranged from 5.3% to 7.3% in 2004 and from 7.0% to 7.3% in 2003
before provisions for adverse deviation, which ranged from 0.2%
to 0.5% in both 2004 and 2003.

Interest and discount rates for traditional life insurance no
longer offered vary by year of issuance and products and were
7.5% grading to 5.3% over 20 years in 2004 and 2003 with
the exception of a block of pre-1980 business which had a
level 8.8% discount rate in both 2004 and 2003.

Mortality assumptions are based upon pricing assumptions and
modified to allow provisions for adverse deviation. Surrender
rates vary by product and are based upon pricing assumptions.

Future policy benefit increases on pre-funded funeral life
insurance policies ranged from 1.0% to 7.0% in 2004 and 2003.
Some policies have future policy benefit increases, which are
guaranteed or tied to equal some measure of inflation. The
inflation assumption for these inflation-linked benefits was
3.0% in both 2004 and 2003 with the exception of most policies
issued in 2004 where the assumption was 1.8%. Traditional life
products issued by the PreNeed segment have level benefits.

The reserves for annuities issued by the independent division
are based on assumed interest rates credited on deferred
annuities, which vary by year of issue, and ranged from 2.0% to
5.5% in 2004 and 2003. Withdrawal charges, if any, generally
range from 7.0% to 0% and grade to zero over a period of seven
years for business issued in the United States. Canadian annuity
products have a surrender charge that varies by product series
and premium paying period, typically grading to zero after all
premiums have been paid.

PreNeed Segment — AMLIC Division

Interest and discount rates for pre-funded funeral life
insurance policies issued October 2000 and beyond vary by issue
year and are based on pricing assumptions and modified to allow
for provisions for adverse deviation. 2004 issues used a
level 5.3% discount rate, 2003 issues used a
level 4.8% discount rate and 2002 issues used a
level 5.8% discount rate. Pre-funded funeral life insurance
policies issued prior to October 2000 and all traditional life
policies issued by the AMLIC division use discount rates, which
vary by issue year and product and ranged from 2.5% to 7.5% in
2004 and 2003.

Mortality assumptions for pre-funded funeral life insurance
products issued in October 2000 and beyond are based upon
pricing assumptions, which approximate actual experience, and
modified to allow for provisions for adverse deviation.
Surrender rates for pre-funded funeral life insurance products
issued in October 2000 and beyond vary by product and are based
upon pricing assumptions, which approximate actual experience.
Mortality assumptions for all pre-funded funeral life insurance
and traditional life insurance issued by the AMLIC division
prior to October 2000 are based on Statutory valuation
requirements with no explicit provision for lapses, which
approximate GAAP.

Future policy benefit increases are based upon pricing
assumptions. First-year guaranteed benefit increases range from
0.0% to 6.0% in 2004 and 2003. Renewal guaranteed benefit
increases range from 0.0% to 3.0% in 2004 and 2003. For
contracts with minimum benefit increases associated with an
inflation index, assumed benefit increases equaled the discount
rate less 3.0% in 2004 and 2003.

The reserves for annuities issued by the AMLIC division are
based on assumed interest rates credited on deferred annuities
and ranged from 1.0% to 6.5% in 2004 and 2003. Withdrawal
charges ranged from 0.0% to 8.0% grading to zero over eight
years for business issued in the United States. Canadian annuity
products have a flat 35% surrender charge. Nearly all the
deferred annuities contracts have a 3.0% guaranteed interest
rate.

Universal Life and Annuities — No Longer
    Offered

The reserves for universal life and annuity products no longer
offered in the Assurant Solutions segment have been established
based on the following assumptions: Interest rates credited on
annuities, which vary by product and time when funds were
received, and ranged from 3.5% to 4.0% in both 2004 and 2003.
Guaranteed crediting rates on annuities range from 3.5% to 4.0%.
Annuities are also subject to surrender charges, which vary by
contract year and grade to zero over a period no longer than
seven years. Surrender values will never be less than the amount
of paid-in premiums (net of prior withdrawals) regardless of the
surrender charge. Credited interest rates on universal life
funds vary by product and the funds received and ranged from
4.0% to 5.1% in 2004 and from 4.0% to 5.5% in 2003. Guaranteed
crediting rates where present ranged from 4.0% to 4.5%.
Additionally, universal life funds are subject to surrender
charges that vary by product, age, sex, year of issue, risk
class, face amount and grade to zero over a period not longer
than 20 years.

FFG and LTC

The reserves for FFG and LTC are included in the Company’s
reserves in accordance with FAS 113,

Accounting and
Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration
Contracts.

The Company maintains an offsetting reinsurance
recoverable related to these reserves (see Note 15).

Short Duration Contracts

The Company’s short duration contracts are comprised of
group term life, group disability, medical and dental, property,
credit, warranty and all other. The principal products and
services included in these categories are described in the
summary of significant accounting polices (see Note 2).

The Company’s disability products are short duration
contracts that include short and long term disablility coverage.
Claims and benefits payable for long-term disability have been
discounted at 5.25% in 2004. The December 31, 2004 and 2003
liabilities include $1,390,081 and $1,318,186, respectively, of
such reserves. The amount of discounts deducted from outstanding
reserves as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 are $455,506 and
$440,460, respectively.

Fair Value Disclosures

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,

Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

(“FAS 107”) requires disclosure of fair value
information about financial instruments, as defined therein, for
which it is practicable to estimate such fair value. These
financial instruments may or may not be recognized in the
consolidated balance sheets. In the measurement of the fair
value of certain financial instruments, if quoted market prices
were not available other valuation techniques were utilized.
These derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by
the assumptions used. Additionally, FAS 107 excludes
certain financial instruments including those related to
insurance contracts.

In estimating the fair value of the financial instruments
presented, the Company used the following methods and
assumptions:

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:

the
carrying amount reported approximates fair value because of the
short maturity of the instruments.

Fixed maturity securities:

the fair value for fixed
maturity securities, which includes both public and 144A
securities, is based on quoted market prices, where available.
For fixed maturity securities not actively traded, fair values
are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing
services or, in the case of private placements, excluding 144A
securities, are estimated by discounting expected future cash
flows using a current market rate applicable to the yield,
credit quality, and maturity of the investments.

F-36


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Equity securities:

fair value of equity securities and
non-sinking fund preferred stocks is based upon quoted market
prices.

Commercial mortgage loans and policy loans:

the fair
values of mortgage loans are estimated using discounted cash
flow analyses, based on interest rates currently being offered
for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.
Mortgage loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for
purposes of the calculations. The carrying amounts of policy
loans reported in the balance sheets approximate fair value.

Other investments:

the fair values of joint ventures are
calculated based on fair market value appraisals. The invested
assets related to a modified coinsurance arrangement and the AIP
are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair
value. The carrying amounts of the remaining other investments
approximate fair value.

Policy reserves under investment products:

the fair
values for the Company’s policy reserves under the
investment products are determined using cash surrender value.

Collateral and obligations under securities lending:

The
fair values of securities lending assets and liabilities are
based on quoted market prices.

Separate account assets and liabilities:

separate account
assets and liabilities are reported at their estimated fair
values in the balance sheet.

The fair value of the Company’s liabilities for insurance
contracts other than investment-type contracts are not required
to be disclosed. However, the fair values of liabilities under
all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the
Company’s overall management of interest rate risk, such
that the Company’s exposure to changing interest rates is
minimized through the matching of investment maturities with
amounts due under insurance contracts.

Retirement and Other Employee Benefits

The Company and its subsidiaries participate in a
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all of their employees. Benefits are based on
certain years of service and the employee’s compensation
during certain such years of service. The Company’s funding
policy is to contribute amounts to the plan sufficient to meet
the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional
amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate from

F-37

time to time up to the maximum permitted. Contributions are
intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service
to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future.
The Company also has noncontributory, nonqualified supplemental
programs covering certain employees.

In addition, the Company provides certain life and healthcare
benefits for retired employees and their dependents.
Substantially all employees of the Company may become eligible
for these benefits depending on age and years of service. The
Company has the right to modify or terminate these benefits.

Summarized information on the Company’s qualified pension
benefits and postretirement plans for the years ended
December 31 is as follows:

The Company’s nonqualified plans are unfunded. At
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 the nonqualified plans had
projected benefit obligations of $85,158, $71,634 and $64,118
respectively, and accumulated benefit obligations of $72,939,
$62,176 and $53,511, respectively. A pre-tax minimum pension
liability of $14,592,

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected
returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds),
the historical level of the risk premium associated with the
other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the
expectations for future returns of each asset class. The
expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on
the targeted asset allocation to develop the expected long-term
rate of return on asset assumptions for the portfolio. This
resulted in the selection of the 8.25% assumption for the fiscal
year 2004, 2003 and 2002.

The goals of the asset strategy are to determine if the growth
in the value of the fund over the long-term, both in real and
nominal terms, manage (control) risk exposure. Risk is
managed by investing in a broad range of asset classes, and
within those asset classes, a broad range of individual
securities.

The Investment Committee that oversees the investment of the
plan assets conducted a review of the Investment Strategies and
Policies of the Plan in the 4th quarter of 2001. This
included a review of the strategic asset allocation, including
the relationship of the Plan liabilities and portfolio

Segment Information

The Company has five reportable segments, which are defined
based on the nature of the products and services offered:
Assurant Solutions, Assurant Health, Assurant Employee Benefits,
Assurant Preneed, and Corporate and Other. Assurant Solutions
provides credit insurance, including life, disability and
unemployment, debt protection administration services,
warranties and extended service contracts, creditor-placed
homeowners insurance and manufactured housing homeowners
insurance. Assurant Health provides individual, short-term and
small group health insurance. Assurant Employee Benefits
provides employee and employer paid dental, disability, and life
insurance products and related services. Assurant Preneed
provides life insurance policies and annuity products that
provide benefits to fund pre-arranged funerals. Corporate and
Other includes activities of the holding company, financing
expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments and
interest income earned from short-term investments held.
Corporate and Other also includes the amortization of deferred
gains associated with the sales of FFG and LTC through
reinsurance agreements.

The Company evaluates performance based on segment income
after-tax excluding realized gains (losses) on investments. The
Company determines reportable segments in a manner consistent
with the way the Company organizes for purposes of making
operating decisions and assessing performance. The accounting
polices of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
(See Note 2)

As of January 1, 2004, the Company changed the segment
invested assets allocation methodology. Previously, the Company
allocated a notional amount of invested assets to the segments
primarily based on future policy benefits, claims and unearned
premiums, and capital allocated to each segment. As of
January 1, 2004, the Company primarily allocates invested
assets based on the actual investment portfolios supporting the
segments. This change resulted in an increase in investment
income of $11,415, $4,096, and $3,413 in Assurant Health,
Assurant Employee Benefits, and Assurant Preneed, respectively,
with a decrease in investment income of $552 and $18,372 in
Assurant Solutions and Corporate and Other, respectively, for
the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company assigns net
deferred acquisition costs, value of businesses acquired,
reinsurance recoverables, and other assets and liabilities to
the respective segments where those assets or liabilities
originate.

In August 2003, the Company began to utilize derivative
instruments in managing the PreNeed segment’s exposure to
inflation risk. The derivative instrument, the CPI CAP, limits
the inflation risk on certain policies to a maximum of 5% and
has a notional amount of $454,000 amortizing to zero over
20 years. The CPI CAP does not qualify under GAAP as an
effective hedge; therefore, it is marked-to-market on a
quarterly basis and the accumulated gain or loss is recognized
in the results of operations in fees and other income. As of
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the CPI CAP
included in other assets amounted to $9,850 and $8,800,
respectively, and the income recorded in the results of
operations totaled $1,050 and $100, respectively.

Incentive Plans

Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan (“AAIR
    Plan”)

Since January 1, 1999, the Company has maintained the
Assurant Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan (formerly the Fortis
Appreciation Incentive Rights Plan), which provides key
employees and directors with the right to receive long-term
incentive cash compensation based on the appreciation in value
of incentive units of the Company and incentive units of each of
its operating business segments. The AAIR Plan is administered
by a committee appointed by the Company’s board of
directors.

The Company accounts for the AAIR Plan as a variable plan in
accordance with the provisions of APB 25 and its
interpretations. Therefore, compensation expense is recognized
based on the intrinsic value method.

Employees of Assurant, Inc. receive 75% of their award value in
Assurant, Inc. incentive rights and the remaining 25% in equal
portions of incentive rights from the business segments. Segment
participants receive 75% of their award value from their own
particular business segment and 25% from Assurant, Inc.

The incentive rights vest over a three-year period from the date
of grant and are exercisable for a period of 7 years from
the date the rights are fully vested. Unexercised vested
incentive rights are exercised automatically following the tenth
anniversary of the date of grant. If upon expiration of the
award the strike price is below the exercise price, then the
award is automatically forfeited.

Upon the closing of the IPO, the AAIR Plan was amended to
provide for the cash-out and replacement of Assurant, Inc.
incentive rights with stock appreciation rights on the Assurant
common stock. The business segment rights outstanding under the
plan were not changed or effected. The conversion of outstanding
Assurant, Inc. incentive rights occurred as described in this
paragraph. The Assurant, Inc. incentive rights were valued as of
December 31, 2003 using a special valuation method, as
follows. The measurement value of

F-48


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

each Assurant, Inc. incentive right as of December 31,
2002, was adjusted to reflect dividends paid by Assurant, Inc.,
consistent with past practices; such adjusted value was then
multiplied by the arithmetic average of the change during
calendar year 2003 in the Dow Jones Life Insurance Index, the
Dow Jones Property Casualty Index, and the Dow Jones Healthcare
Providers Index; and the result became the measurement value of
Assurant, Inc. incentive rights as of December 31, 2003.

On January 18, 2004, each Assurant, Inc. incentive right
then outstanding under the plan was cashed out for a cash
payment equal to the difference, if any, between the measurement
value of the Assurant, Inc. incentive rights as of
December 31

st

immediately preceeding the date of grant, and the measurement
value of that right determined as of December 31, 2003,
pursuant to the special valuation. Each outstanding Assurant,
Inc. incentive right, whether or not vested, was cancelled
effective as of the date it was cashed out. Following the
cash-out and cancellation of Assurant, Inc. incentive rights,
Assurant granted to each participant whose rights were cashed
out a number of stock appreciation rights on Assurant’s
common stock (referred to as “replacement rights”).
The number of replacement rights granted to a participant was
equal (1) the measurement value of the participant’s
cashed-out Assurant, Inc. incentive rights, divided by
(2) the IPO price of $22 a share. Each replacement right
that replaced a vested cashed-out right was vested immediately,
and each replacement right that replaced a non-vested cashed-out
right will become vested on the vesting date for the
corresponding cashed-out right, but no replacement right,
whether or not vested, may be exercised sooner than one year
from the closing date of the IPO. After that waiting period,
each replacement right is exercisable for the remaining term of
the corresponding cancelled right.

The value of each Assurant, Inc. stock appreciation right is
based on the Assurant common stock price. The value of each
business segment right is based on an independent valuation of
the Company performed by a qualified appraiser. Each year, the
appraiser determines a fair market value for the individual
business segments. Based on this valuation, “phantom share
prices” are established for each business segment. These
share prices are calculated by dividing the market value of a
business segment by the number of outstanding “phantom
shares” in that segment.

The Assurant, Inc. stock appreciation right price and business
segment phantom share price established for a given grant year
become the strike price for that year and the exercise price for
prior grant years. When the share price increases above the
strike price, the rights accrue intrinsic value that will be
paid in cash when exercised.

The Company recognized $31,503, $27,072 and $19,570 of
compensation expense for the AAIR Plan in 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

Stock Option Plan

In contemplation of the IPO, the Company’s Stock Option
Plan, which was based indirectly on the performance and value of
the stock of Fortis, was terminated effective as of
September 22, 2003. All stock options thereunder were
cancelled in exchange for a payment of the fair value of such
options, as determined by an independent third party. Payments
totaling $2,237 were made in the fourth quarter of 2003. There
is no further obligation associated with the Company’s
Stock Option Plan.

AIP

The AIP, provides key employees the ability to exchange a
portion of their compensation for options to purchase certain
third-party mutual funds. The plan became effective as of
January 1, 1999 and is administered by the Company’s
Senior Vice President-Compensation and Benefits, who is referred
to as the administrator. Under the AIP, a participant may
exchange all or a portion of his or her eligible compensation
for a specific number of options under the plan. Each option
represents the right to purchase shares of Company designated
third-party mutual funds, as selected by the participant. Each
option is fully vested and

F-49


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

exercisable on the grant date. Options may not be exercised more
than twice in any calendar year, except with the consent of the
administrator. For most options, the exercise period generally
will expire 120 months after the participant’s death,
disability or retirement or 60 months after the
participant’s termination of employment for any other
reason. Until the options are exercised, a participant may
instruct the administrator to exchange some or all of the
options to purchase different underlying mutual fund units.
Employee compensation exchanged for options is included as
compensation expense prior to the exchange. Subsequent to the
exchange, the Company accounts for invested assets in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standard 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

and as
such, the Company marks-to-market the AIP investment balances on
a quarterly basis. This quarterly mark-to-market adjustment
equally impacts the AIP investment and the AIP liability
balance. When options are exercised, the investment and
liability balances are reduced accordingly. The amounts included
in other investments and other liabilities were $93,246 and
$57,451 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See
Note 26 for subsequent amendments to the AIP Plan.

Related Party Transactions

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into
a number of agreements with Fortis.

Fortis maintained a $1,000,000 commercial paper facility that
prior to the IPO the Company had been able to access (via
intercompany loans) for up to $750,000. The Company has used the
commercial paper facility to cover any cash shortfalls, which
may occur from time to time. In mid-December 2003, the Company
used the commercial paper facility in the amount of $74,991 for
three days to cover a cash shortfall in the early extinguishment
of the Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities. The Company
had no outstanding intercompany loans with Fortis related to
this commercial paper facility at year-end December 31,
2003 and no longer has access to this facility.

During 2003 and 2002, the Company paid $644 and $749,
respectively, to Fortis for costs representing salary, benefits
and other expenses of a director of the Company, who was then an
employee of a Fortis subsidiary, and his support staff. The
Company discontinued these payments as of October 3, 2003.

The other related party transactions are disclosed in
Notes 1, 8, 11, 12, and 26.

Subsequent Events

See Note 1 for a discussion of the secondary offering.

On February 4, 2005, the Assurant Solutions segment was
awarded $70,730 in damages by a Tennessee state court jury in a
contract dispute with Progeny Marketing Innovations, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Cendant Corporation. The verdict
included $8,000 for a violation of the Tennessee Consumer
Protection Act, $15,120 for breach of contract, $42,610 for
breach of fiduciary duty and $5,000 in punitive damages. Cendant
is entitled to an offset of approximately $14,300, and Assurant
Solutions has additional claims exceeding $25,000 for treble
damages under the Consumer Protection Act, interest, and
attorneys’ fees and expenses. These issues have yet to be
decided in post-trial motions. As a result, the total amount of
the verdict has not yet been determined. In addition, the
verdict is subject to appeal. The Company has not recorded any
amounts in the financials statements as a result of this verdict.

Effective March 1, 2005, the Company amended the AIP and
created the Assurant Deferred Compensation Plan
(“ADCP”) in order to comply with the Jobs Act. The
ADCP continues to provide key employees the ability to defer a
portion of their compensation consistent with the Jobs Act
definition of eligible compensation and distribution
requirements. Except for the definition of compensation eligible
for deferral and the timing of distributions, the terms of the
ADCP are materially the same as the AIP as described in
Note 22.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries lease office space and
equipment under operating lease arrangements. Certain facility
leases contain escalation clauses based on increases in the
lessors’ operating expenses. At December 31, 2004, the
aggregate future minimum lease payment under operating lease
agreements that have initial or non-cancelable terms in excess
of one year are:

Rent expense was $37,712, $36,863 and $39,812 for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued
primarily to support reinsurance arrangements. These letters of
credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions.
The Company had approximately $65,607 and $117,000 of letters of
credit outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The Company is regularly involved in litigation in the ordinary
course of business, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff. The
Company may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal
and regulatory actions relating to the Company’s current
and past business operations. While the Company cannot predict
the outcome of any pending or future litigation, examination or
investigation, the Company does not believe that any pending
matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

The Solutions segment is subject to a number of pending actions,
primarily in the State of Mississippi, many of which allege that
the Company’s credit insurance products were packaged and
sold with lenders’ products without buyer consent. The
judicial climate in Mississippi is such that the outcome of
these cases is extremely unpredictable. The Company has been
advised by legal counsel that the Company has meritorious
defenses to all claims being asserted against the Company. The
Company believes, based on information currently available, that
the amounts accrued are adequate.

On October 1, 2003, a grand jury in Mower County,
Minnesota, issued an indictment of American Bankers Insurance
Company (“ABIC”), part of the Solutions segment, and
two of its officers. The indictment alleged that ABIC and its
two named corporate officers each violated the Minnesota Fair
Campaign Practices Act in connection with two contributions by
ABIC to the Republican National State Election Committee
totaling $15. On April 5, 2004, the prosecuting authorities
voluntarily dismissed all charges against ABIC and the two
officers. ABIC, in turn, agreed to reimburse Mower County for
costs of investigation and prosecution; these costs are not
material to the financial statements.

In addition, another part of the Solutions segment, American
Reliable Insurance Company (“ARIC”), participated in
certain excess of loss reinsurance programs in the London market
and, as a result, reinsured certain personal accident, ransom
and kidnap insurance risks from 1995 to 1997. ARIC and a foreign
affiliate ceded a portion of these risks to other reinsurers
(retrocessionaires). ARIC ceased reinsuring such business in
1997. However, certain risks continued beyond 1997 due to the
nature of the reinsurance contracts written. ARIC and some of
the other reinsurers involved in the programs are seeking to
avoid certain treaties on various grounds, including material
misrepresentation and non-disclosure by the ceding companies and

F-52


Assurant, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

intermediaries involved in the programs. Similarly, some of the
retrocessionaires are seeking avoidance of certain treaties with
ARIC and the other reinsurers and some reinsureds are seeking
collection of disputed balances under some of the treaties. The
disputes generally involve multiple layers of reinsurance, and
allegations that the reinsurance programs involved interrelated
claims “spirals” devised to disproportionately pass
claims losses to higher-level reinsurance layers. Many of the
companies involved in these programs, including ARIC, are
currently involved in negotiations, arbitration and/or
litigation between multiple layers of retrocessionaires,
reinsurers, ceding companies and intermediaries, including
brokers, in an effort to resolve these disputes. Many of those
disputes relating to the 1995 program year, including those
involving ARIC, were settled on December 3, 2003. Loss
accruals previously established relating to the 1995 program
year were adequate. However, the Company’s exposure under
the 1995 program year was less significant than the exposure
remaining under the 1996 and 1997 program years. In addition,
disputes with two affiliated reinsurers involved in the 1996 and
1997 program years were settled by a commutation agreement. Loss
accruals previously established relating to this business were
adequate. The Company believes, based on information currently
available, that the amounts accrued for currently outstanding
disputes are adequate. This loss accrual is management’s
best estimate. However, the inherent uncertainty of arbitrations
and lawsuits, including the uncertainty of estimating whether
any settlements the Company may enter into in the future would
be on favorable terms, makes it difficult to predict the
outcomes with certainty.

The Company was notified on August 26, 2004 that one of our
employees is being investigated by the criminal division of the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for responses he made
to questions he was asked by the IRS relating to an
approximately $18,000 tax reserve taken by us in 1999. At this
stage, it would be speculative to predict the outcome of this
investigation. However, it could result in a fine assessed
against the employee and the Company, negative publicity for the
Company or more serious sanctions.
