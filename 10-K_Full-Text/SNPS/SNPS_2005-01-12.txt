The Role of EDA in the Electronics Industry

Technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density, speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors
(also referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips).


•

Since
the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires imprinted on the chip that form the transistors) and other developments have enabled IC
manufacturers to follow "Moore's law," approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip. As a result, state-of-the-art
ICs now hold over one hundred million transistors and have feature widths of 90 nanometers (billionths of a meter), going to 65 nanometers and below.

•

Microprocessors
operating at more than 4 gigahertz, a speed unheard of only a few years ago, are readily available today.

•

Chips
have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, music players and personal
digital assistants.

•

Increasingly,
single SoCs can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board.

Combined,
these advances in semiconductor technology have driven development of lower cost, higher performance computers, wireless communications networks, hand held devices, Internet
routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and manufacturers to equipment
manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as Synopsys.

The IC Design Process

EDA software is central to the IC design process, enabling designers to design complex semiconductors by using a high-level, abstract description of
the function of the chip. EDA software is used to automatically translate this description into successively more detailed forms, and to verify at each stage in the design process that the chip's
design is sound and that the chip when manufactured will function as originally intended.

In
simplified form, the IC design process consists of system design, register transfer level design, logic design, functional verification, physical design and physical verification.

System Design.

In system design, the designer describes the chip's desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized
high-level computer language, typically C++ or System C. This phase yields a relatively high-level behavioral model of the chip.

Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design.

RTL design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the
system level using a specialized high-level computer language, typically Verilog or VHDL. This is the stage where the functionality of the final design is captured in enough detail to
begin simulation and verification and determine that the final product will function as expected in the verification phase.

Logic Design.

Logic design, or "synthesis," programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a
data file known as a net list describing the various groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip. Related programs insert the additional circuitry into the design that will be needed to
test the chip after manufacture. In a growing number of designs, designers are increasingly performing "design planning" in which the designer determines the location of the major functional "blocks"
on the SoC prior to logic synthesis.

Functional Verification.

At the RTL and gate level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools such as RTL
simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to simulate large sets of inputs that a given IC design might confront in a real-life operation. By running these extensive
tests, the designer can verify that the design will function as intended.


Physical Design.

In the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of
the wires connecting them with "place and route" products. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within
each block, a process known as "placement." In many designs, placement is performed in conjunction with logic synthesis, a process known as "physical synthesis." After placement the designer adds the
connections between the transistors, a process known as "routing." The output of place and route programs is one or more data files that can be read by physical verification or mask data preparation
programs.

Physical Verification.

Before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a
series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip. The designer may
need to add features to the design to ensure that the chip can be manufactured successfully. The completion of this final phase is called "tapeout."

In
actual chip design, each of these steps has a number of additional elements, and designers often undertake the various design and verification steps in a different order than
described above, and repeat one or more steps (particularly functional and physical verification) multiple times. Further, several of the steps, especially logic design and physical design, are
becoming more integrated with each other. If at any stage of the process the designer determines the chip design will not perform as intended, the designer must go back one or more steps and correct
the problem, then continue through
subsequent steps. Recreating a chip's logic design, performing simulation over again, and repeating other steps all take time. Each such iteration adds significant costs and makes it more difficult
for the designer to meet time-to-market goals.

Current Issues Facing IC Designers

As chip technology continues to advance, our customers are seeking to maximize the quality of results of their IC design efforts, while minimizing the costs of
achieving these results and shortening the time needed to launch the manufactured IC, as follows:

•

Quality of Results.

Customers are concerned about differentiating their chips from their competitors' in a number of areas,
including size or area, speed, functionality, power consumption and performance. The designer must balance each issue against the others, making key tradeoff decisions—often through
multiple iterations—to reach a final design. As chips become more complex and manufacturing geometries shrink, this balancing of factors becomes disproportionately more difficult, and
requires designers to successfully address technical issues, including:

•

Timing closure

: achieving consistency between the speed of the chip at the logic design phase
and the speed of the chip at the physical design phase;

•

Signal integrity

: ensuring chip performance is not affected by unintended electrical effects,
like cross-talk and other forms of interference, that occur as the wires on a chip get more narrow and closer together;

•

Power management

: reducing the chip's power consumption, an important objective for chips to be
used in battery-operated devices, particularly in the case of laptop computers and cell phones where both longer battery life and lower power drain in standby mode is critical;

•

Design for test

: embedding circuits in the design that allow the chip, once manufactured, to be
tested rapidly and at a reasonable cost;

•

Verification

: verifying that the chip will perform as intended, which has become the single most
time-consuming and resource intensive aspect of overall design;


•

Manufacturability

: faithfully translating the design produced by EDA tools into a manufacturable
pattern of wires and transistors on the chip has become significantly more difficult as a result of decreasing feature widths and increasing feature density; and

•

Yield

: ensuring that an acceptable number of good chips per wafer can be manufactured
successfully.

•

Cost of Results.

Customers are continually seeking to constrain their costs, including costs of design, masks, equipment,
facilities and support, all of which typically increase as chips become more complex. The higher the cost, the higher the expected volume of chips the customer must sell to make a given chip project
profitable. Faced with increasing costs, our customers continue to focus intensely on controlling their research and development and manufacturing costs, including their EDA software costs and
maximizing their yield in manufacture. As a result, many of our customers have begun consolidating suppliers to improve their purchasing terms and, more importantly, to gain the benefits of better
integrated products.

•

Time to Results.

Finally, customers are seeking to improve the predictability of their production schedule. Economic
pressures, competition and continuing innovation continue to shorten the life cycle of electronic products. Accordingly, time-to-market is critical to a product's commercial
success. The design time for a product's IC components is a major determining factor of that product's time-to-market. Accordingly, our customers require EDA products that can
address the challenges described above while reducing overall design time.

Strategy

We provide products and services that help our customers design leading-edge ICs while maximizing achievement of their quality of results, cost of
results and time to results goals.

Historically,
customers have purchased individual "point tools" to complete one or more tasks or sets of tasks in the design process, dealing internally with moving from one design
environment or data set to the next, while integrating various products—or even developing design tools—themselves where necessary. However, with the increasing complexity of
IC design, cost pressures and ever smaller market windows, customers require broader solutions with greater performance from fewer vendors at lower costs.

To
meet this need, we have combined our individual products—many of which lead their respective categories—into platforms, or collections of products that are
integrated through the use of common interfaces, data sets and other technologies, to deliver a comprehensive, faster and more reliable design flow. In fiscal 2003, we released our Galaxy™
Design and Discovery™ Verification platforms, which together provide complete implementation and verification solutions to our customers. In fiscal 2004, we delivered the Galaxy 2004
platform, providing full, cross-platform correlation in area, timing, power, signal integrity and test, as well as significant speed and capacity improvement. We also delivered substantial
improvements to the capabilities, speed, capacity and accuracy of our Discovery Verification platform.

To
help our customers better manage time, cost and risk, we have also continued to invest in pre-designed, pre-verified and reusable intellectual property blocks
our customers can use rather than build internally. These blocks include our DesignWare® Foundation Library of reusable, basic chip elements which can be pulled into designs during logic
synthesis, our DesignWare Verification Library of reusable chip function models to accelerate simulation and verification, and our DesignWare Cores that implement many of the most important industry
standards for digital and analog connectivity, including USB and PCI Express. We also provide professional services to assist our customers with their most difficult design challenges.


Finally,
recognizing the challenges of manufacturing at feature widths smaller that the wavelength of light, and envisioning the benefits of taking manufacturing and yield issues into
account during the design process, we have also continued to invest in our portfolio of Design for Manufacturing tools and technologies.

•

Milkyway™ Database,

a common design data repository which enables better interoperability among implementation
and analysis tools. Storing design data in this single
database with rapid read/write access can reduce data translation times between tools and inconsistent interpretations of diverse data. Interfaces to our open Milkyway database have been made
available to our customers and other EDA vendors to reduce integration costs for our customers and advance tool interoperability in the industry.

The
Galaxy Design Platform provides our customers a single, integrated IC design solution based on leading individual products and incorporating common libraries and consistent timing,
delay calculation and constraints throughout the design process. The platform uses our open Milkyway database and allows designers the flexibility to integrate internally developed and third-party
tools. With this advanced functionality, common foundation and flexibility, our Galaxy Design Platform helps reduce design times, decrease integration costs and minimize the risks inherent in
advanced, complex IC designs. During fiscal 2004, we released the Galaxy 2004 platform, the latest version of the Galaxy Design Platform, which delivers significantly improved quality of results, time
to results and cost of results through greater correlation among the platform's individual products in addressing area, timing, power, signal integrity and test issues. We also introduced our Galaxy
Power solution in fiscal 2004, offering designers the ability to improve the power efficiency of their ICs.


Verification Group

Discovery Verification Platform.

Our Discovery Verification Platform includes our verification and simulation products. The
increasing size and complexity of today's ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to 70% of total design
time. As a result, reducing verification "risk" (i.e. minimizing the possibility of finding design "bugs" when the ICs are delivered from the foundry) has become increasingly important to customers.
To manage and reduce this verification risk, our Discovery platform combines our simulation and verification products and design-for-verification methodologies, and provides a
consistent control environment to significantly improve the speed, breadth and accuracy of our customers' verification efforts.

Our
Discovery Verification Platform includes the following principal products:

•

VCS®

functional verification product, the engine of the Discovery Verification Platform and often used in
simulation "farms" consisting of hundreds of computers. The VCS product includes technologies that support model development, testbench creation, coverage feedback and debugging techniques. Our fiscal
2004 release of the VCS product expands support of our Vera® product, making testbench automation native to VCS, and helping post a two to five times improvement in runtime.

•

System Studio

system level design product focused on system-level algorithm and architecture design and analysis, as well as
the interaction between software and hardware and permits designers to model various architectural alternatives for their chips at a system level.

•

Vera®

testbench generator, which automates the creation of testbenches, custom models that provide simulation
inputs and respond to simulated outputs from the design during verification. Automating this process significantly improves verification quality. The 2004 release of the
Vera product is up to 10 times faster than its predecessor and is also available native to the VCS product, providing increased productivity benefits.

•

LEDA

® design rule checker, which enhances a designer's ability to check a design to ensure it can be for
synthesized, simulated, tested and reused.

•

Formality®

formal verification solution, which compares two versions of a design to determine if they are
equivalent. The use of formal verification reduces the need to perform functional verification, which is substantially more time-consuming, thus potentially saving a significant amount of
time in the overall design process.

•

Magellan™

hybrid formal verification product, which combines functional and formal verification technologies to
allow engineers to find deep, corner-case design defects during verification.

•

NanoSim®

simulation and analysis product for analog and mixed signal verification, which offers circuit
simulation, timing and power analysis in a single solution. The NanoSim product is a key component of our Discovery AMS verification solution.

•

HSPICE®

circuit simulator, which offers high-accuracy, transistor-level circuit simulation, thereby
enabling designers to better predict the timing, power consumption and functionality of their designs. During fiscal 2004, we announced enhancements to the HSPICE tool resulting in significant
improvements in performance and support for high-frequency and RF IC designs.

•

Verification IP

reusable IP that are designed to test specific functions and adherence to industry protocols in an IC design,
which we believe is becoming increasingly important to more quickly achieving verification sign-off.

In
fiscal 2004, we delivered the Discovery AMS solution, a subset of our verification technologies optimized to perform verification on analog and mixed signal designs.


Silicon Engineering Group

Our Silicon Engineering Group develops and markets our products and initiatives relating to design for manufacturing and analog/mixed signal IC design and
verification.

Design for Manufacturing.

We offer a variety of products and technologies used at the intersection of IC design and
manufacturing which address a number of issues, principally the need to precisely model structures in small geometry ICs and the problems encountered when using photolithography techniques to
manufacture ICs containing feature dimensions smaller than the wavelength of light during production. These products are designed to enhance yield, which is becoming increasingly challenging as chip
geometries continue to shrink. In addition to our Hercules product, described above under the Galaxy platform our Design for Manufacturing initiatives include our:

•

TCAD

products, which precisely model individual structures or devices within an IC design to help ensure manufacturability at
small geometries. We see TCAD tools as increasingly important to help customers shorten the time to ramp up their production yields, and therefore reduce their manufacturing costs. In this regard, we
have made significant investments to expand our TCAD offering, including our November 2004 acquisition of ISE Integrated Systems Engineering AG, a privately-held Swiss company which
offered various TCAD products, including three dimensional devise simulators. We also introduced our Taurus Process Atomistic product which models processes at the atomic level for improved
performance.

•

Proteus OPC/InPhase

optical proximity correction (OPC) products which embed and verify corrective features in an IC design
and masks to improve manufacturing results for subwavelength feature width design. OPC changes mask geometries to compensate for distortions caused by optical diffraction and resist process effects.
During fiscal 2004, we announced improvements to Proteus to provide near linear scalability.

•

Phase Shift Masking Technologies

consist of mask design techniques that use optical interference to improve
depth-of-field and resolution in subwavelength photolithography for designs at 90 nanometers and below.

•

SiVL®

(Silicon versus Layout)

layout verification product that verifies the layout of a subwavelength IC against
the silicon it is intended to produce by reading in the layout and simulating lithographic process effects, including optical, resist and etch effects.

•

CATS

® mask data preparation product that takes a final IC design and "fractures" or "breaks" it into the physical
features that will be included in the photomasks to be used in manufacturing.

•

Virtual Stepper

® mask qualification product, which checks mask quality and analyzes printability of mask defects,
helping to separate true defects from nuisance defects.

Analog and Mixed-Signal Tools.

The Silicon Engineering Group also manages a number of products described above and
functionally included in our Galaxy and Discovery platforms that have advanced analog and mixed-signal design capabilities. These products include the NanoSim and HSPICE circuit simulators. In
addition, this category includes our Cosmos™ product, which uses schematic-driven layout technology to place and route full-custom ICs, and our Circuit Explorer optimization
and analysis product for complex analog designs.

Solutions Group

Synopsys' Solutions Group includes our portfolio of IP products and components and our Professional Services Group.

Intellectual Property Products.

As IC designs continue to grow in size, reusing proven design blocks has become an
increasingly important way to reduce overall design cost and cycle time. Because


verification
accounts for such a large proportion of total chip design time, reusing pre-designed and verified IP components can keep projects on schedule by ensuring that the "designed
in" portions of the chip are "pre-verified" and thus will not contain errors. The ability to reuse such IP allows IC companies to focus their design teams on designing the chip features
that will give its products a competitive advantage. For these reasons, IC designers are consolidating their IP purchases from fewer vendors who can provide a reliable, comprehensive portfolio of
proven IP.

Our
IP products include:

•

DesignWare Foundation Library

is an extensive library of basic chip elements (for example, adders and multipliers) which
Design Compiler incorporates into the design during the logic synthesis stage.

•

DesignWare Verification Library

is our library of popular chip function models used during the verification process of chip
design.

•

DesignWare Cores

are pre-designed and pre-verified digital and mixed-signal design blocks that
implement many of the most important industry standards, including USB (1.1, 2.0 and On-The-Go), PCI (PCI, PCI-X and PCI Express), Ethernet and JPEG. During fiscal
2004, we announced availability of DesignWare PCI Express physical layer IP core, enabling lower cost ICs. We also acquired Accelerant Networks, Inc., giving our customers access to SERDES
technology and additional connectivity IP solutions. Finally, during the year we acquired Cascade Semiconductor Solutions, Inc., adding their root-and-switch port IP. As
a result, we believe we offer the industry's most complete PCI Express portfolio.

Professional Services.

We provide a comprehensive portfolio of consulting services covering all critical phases of the SoC
development process, as well as systems development in wireless and broadband applications. We offer customers a variety of engagement models, from on-site design assistance to help our
customers design, verify and/or test their chips and improve their design processes, to full turnkey development and training.

We actively create and support standards that will help our customers increase productivity, improve interoperability of tools from different vendors, and solve
design problems. Standards in the EDA industry can be established by formal accredited committees, by licensing made available to all, or through open source licensing.

Synopsys'
products support many formal standards, including the most commonly used hardware description languages, VHDL, Verilog HDL, SystemVerilog and SystemC, as well as numerous
industry standard data formats for the exchange of data between our tools, other EDA vendor's products and applications customers develop internally.

Synopsys
is a board member and/or participant in the following major EDA standards organizations:

•

Accellera,
a not-for-profit formal standards organization that drives language-based standards for systems, semiconductor, and design tool companies;

•

the
interoperability committee of the EDA Consortium, which helps promote quality and interoperability among EDA products from different vendors;

•

the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a non-profit, technical professional association and a leading developer of global industry
standards;

•

the
Virtual Socket Interface Alliance (VSIA), an industry group that promotes standards that facilitate the integration and reuse of functional blocks of intellectual
property; and

•

the
Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI), a non-profit organization that manages SystemC, a language developed by Synopsys and donated to OSCI, with representation
from the systems, semiconductor, IP, embedded software and EDA industries.

Synopsys'
TAP-in

SM

program provides interface standards to all companies through
an open source licensing model. Synopsys manages changes and enhancements that come from the community of licensees. Synopsys, other EDA companies and EDA customers use these standards to facilitate
interoperability of their tools. The standards offered through our TAP-in program include our Liberty™ format for library modeling, SDC for design constraints, SAIF for
switching activity, our OpenVera® language for hardware verification, and Open MAST for electromechanical design modeling. Synopsys' common database, Milkyway, is available for tool
integration by EDA vendors through our MAP-in

SM

program.


Synopsys'
products are written mainly in the C and C++ languages and utilize industry standards for graphical user interfaces. Our software runs under UNIX operating systems, such as
Solaris and HP-UX, and under the RedHat Linux operating system. Synopsys' products run on the most widely used hardware platforms, including those from Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard,
IBM and PCs that are based upon Intel and AMD microprocessors.

Sales, Distribution and Backlog

We market our products and services primarily through direct sales in the United States and principal foreign markets. We typically distribute our products and
documentation to customers electronically, but provide physical media (i.e. CD-ROMs) when requested by the customer. We employ highly skilled engineers and technically proficient sales
persons in order to understand our customers' needs and explain and demonstrate the value of our products.

We
have sales/support centers throughout the United States, in addition to our Mountain View, California headquarters. Outside the United States, we have sales/support offices in Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Our foreign
headquarters is located in Dublin, Ireland. Our offices are further described under Part I, Item 2.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

for additional
information about one of our former distributors.

In
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, foreign revenues represented 45%, 43% and 35%, respectively, of Synopsys' total revenue. Additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations
is contained in Note 10 of our

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors That May Affect Future Results—Stagnation of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate
fluctuations or other international issues could adversely affect our performance

.

Historically,
our orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and
the first quarter of the next fiscal year, although the timing of major license renewals can alter this typical trend. However, as a result of the shift in our license model, as more fully described
in Part II, Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Orders and
Revenue Seasonality

, we expect less revenue seasonality beginning in fiscal year 2005.

Synopsys'
aggregate non-cancelable backlog was approximately $1.48 billion on October 31, 2004, representing an approximately 8% decrease from the end of fiscal
2003. Aggregate non-cancelable backlog includes deferred revenue, operational backlog and financial backlog and excludes all items relating to consulting services. Deferred revenue
represents that portion of orders for software products, license maintenance and other services which has been delivered and billed to the customer but on which the revenue has not yet been earned.
Operational backlog consists of orders for software products sold under perpetual or term licenses and TSLs with customer-requested ship dates within three months that have not been shipped. Financial
backlog consists of future installments under time-based licenses and maintenance which are not yet currently due and payable. Our aggregate backlog at the end of fiscal 2004 including
consulting was approximately $1.53 billion, approximately 9% lower than at the end of fiscal 2003.

We
have not historically experienced material order cancellations.


See
Item 13.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

for information concerning customers accounting for more than 10% of our
revenue during fiscal 2004.

Research and Development

Our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms, maintain and enhance our current products,
develop new products, and meet an expanding range of customer requirements. Research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group. In addition, an
Advanced Technology Group within Synopsys' Silicon Engineering Group explores new technologies and maintains strong research relationships outside Synopsys with both industry and academia.

During
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, research and development expenses, net of capitalized software development costs, were $285.3 million, $285.9 million and
$225.5 million, respectively. Synopsys capitalized software development costs were approximately $2.7 million, $2.6 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase slightly in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased headcount from acquisitions during fiscal 2004 and higher targeted incentive
compensation.

Competition

The EDA industry is highly competitive. We compete against other EDA vendors and against our customers' own design tools and internal design capabilities. In
general, we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), time-to-results, post-sale
support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and payment terms.

Our
competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services, such as Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation, and companies that offer
products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process, such as Magma Design Automation, Inc. Since the recent semiconductor downturn, we have increasingly competed on the
basis of payment terms and price. In certain situations, in order to win business we must offer substantial discounts on our products due to competitive factors. In other situations, we may lose
potential business to a vendor offering a lower price.

Product Sales and Licensing Agreements

We typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our
software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. The majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined
network, including, in some cases, regional or global networks. License fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed.

Under
certain circumstances, we provide our customers the right to exchange a portion of the software they initially license for other specified Synopsys products. For example, a
customer may use our front-end design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for back-end placement software for the remainder of the term
in order to complete the customer's IC design. This practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. The customer's exchange of product for other
existing products, when so provided under the customer agreement, does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer, which is governed by our revenue recognition
policies. The ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products, because customers can obtain more of their design flow from
a single vendor and because customers then have an opportunity to try additional Synopsys tools before licensing them separately. At the same


time,
because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced
revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without exchange rights.

We
currently offer our software products under two license types: renewable TSLs and perpetual licenses. For a full discussion of these licenses, see Part II, Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies

and

Results of Operations

—

Revenue Background

.

With
respect to our DesignWare Core intellectual property products, we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights
for specific applications. Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases, royalties.

Finally,
our professional services teams typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project.

Proprietary Rights

Synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and
protect its proprietary rights. Our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work. However, third parties may develop similar technology independently. In
addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. We currently hold United States and foreign patents on some of the technologies
included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future.

Under
our customer agreements and other license agreements, in many cases we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party's intellectual property
rights. As a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. For example, we are currently defending some of our customers against claims
that their use of one of our products infringes a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue this defense.

Employees

As of October 31, 2004, Synopsys had 4,378 full-time employees, with 2,940 based in North America and 1,438 based outside of North America. Our
future financial results depend in part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and
managerial personnel. We participate in a dynamic industry, with significant start-up activity, and our headquarters is located in Silicon Valley, where competition for the most highly
skilled technical, sales and management employees is intense.

Item 2.

Properties

United States Facilities

Synopsys' principal offices are located in four adjacent buildings in Mountain View, California, which together provide approximately 400,000 square feet of
available space. This space is leased through February 2015. Within one half mile of these buildings, in Sunnyvale, California, Synopsys occupies approximately 200,000 square feet of space in
two adjacent buildings under lease through April 2007, and approximately 72,000 square feet of space in a third building under lease through April 2007. We use these buildings for
administrative, marketing, research and development, sales and support activities.


We own two buildings totaling approximately 230,000 square feet on approximately 43 acres of land in Hillsboro, Oregon. Only one of these buildings is occupied, and is used for
administrative, marketing, research and development and support activities. In addition, we lease approximately 80,000 square feet of space in Marlboro, Massachusetts for sales and support, research
and development and customer education activities. This facility is leased through January 2009.

Synopsys
owns a third building in Sunnyvale, California with approximately 120,000 square feet, which is leased to a third party through February 2009. Synopsys also owns 34 acres
of undeveloped land in San Jose, California and 13 acres of undeveloped land in Marlboro, Massachusetts.

Synopsys
currently leases 32 other offices throughout the United States, primarily for sales and support.

International Facilities

Synopsys leases approximately 45,000 square feet in Dublin, Ireland for its foreign headquarters and for research and development purposes. This space is leased
through April 2026. In addition, Synopsys leases foreign sales and service offices in Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the
People's Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We also lease research and development facilities in Armenia, Canada, France, Germany, India, the
Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

As
a result of acquisitions, we have assumed leases in a number of foreign and domestic locations. Following each acquisition, where feasible, we consolidate the acquired company's
employees and operations into our existing local sites. In such cases, we generally seek to sublease the assumed space or negotiate with the landlord to terminate the underlying lease.

We
believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

On August 25, 2004, a class action complaint entitled Kanekal v. Synopsys, Inc., et al., No. C-04-3580, was filed in
federal district court for the Northern District of California against Synopsys and certain of our officers alleging violations of the Exchange Act. The complaint purports to be a class action lawsuit
brought on behalf of persons who acquired Synopsys stock during the period of December 3, 2003 through August 18, 2004. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants caused
Synopsys to make false and misleading statements about Synopsys' business, forecasts, and financial performance, and that certain Synopsys officers or employees sold portions of their stock holdings
while in the possession of adverse, non-public information. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought. In November 2004, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff in
the case. As a result, Synopsys expects the plaintiff to file an amended complaint in January 2005. Discovery has not commenced in the case and no trial date has been established. While
management intends to defend against these federal securities claims vigorously, and Synopsys does not believe that this lawsuit will have a material effect on Synopsys' financial position, results of
operations or cash flows, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of this lawsuit.

After
the end of fiscal 2004, and in connection with our December 1, 2004 announcement that we have signed agreements to acquire Nassda Corporation (Nassda) and to settle all
outstanding litigation between the two companies, a class action complaint entitled Robert Israel v. Nassda Corporation, et. al., No. 4705695, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware naming Nassda, its directors and Synopsys as defendants. The complaint purports to be a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of shareholders of Nassda, other than the defendant directors
and their affiliates, who allegedly


would
be injured or threatened with injury if the proposed acquisition of Nassda by Synopsys proceeded forward on the terms announced. The purported class action seeks to enjoin the transaction, or
alternatively, damages. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought. Synopsys believes the claims in this purported class action are without merit, and intends to defend against them
vigorously.

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion
contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth below under the caption entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results."

Synopsys
is a world leader in EDA software for semiconductor design. We deliver technology-leading semiconductor design and verification software platforms and IC manufacturing software
products to the global electronics market, enabling the development and production of complex SoCs. We also provide IP and design services to simplify the design process and accelerate
time-to-market for our customers.

Fiscal 2004 Business Environment

We generate substantially all of our revenue from the semiconductor and electronics industries. Our customers typically fund purchases of our software and
services out of their research and development (R&D) budgets. As a result, our business is heavily influenced by our customers' business outlook and willingness to invest in new, and increasingly
complex, chip designs.

Beginning
in late calendar 2000, the semiconductor industry experienced its steepest and longest downturn of the past 20 years. Semiconductor industry sales dropped approximately
46% from late 2000 to early 2002 and then recovered slowly into 2003. Throughout this period, our customers took many steps to reduce their expenses, including constraining R&D expenditures, reducing
the number of
design engineers they employed, cutting back on their design starts, purchasing from fewer suppliers, and requiring more favorable pricing, payment and license terms from those suppliers, as well as
pursuing consolidation within their own industry. Further, during this downturn, many semiconductor design companies failed or were acquired and the pace of investment in new companies declined.

The
Semiconductor Industry Association reported semiconductor industry growth of approximately 18% in 2003 and estimates growth in 2004 of approximately 29%. Historically, growth in
semiconductor sales has been followed by growth in semiconductor R&D spending, which in turn has led to growth in EDA expenditures. This relationship is not precise, however, and in the past there has
been a lag of several quarters between an upturn in semiconductor industry sales and growth in EDA spending. At the beginning of fiscal 2004, we based our forecast for the year in part on our
expectations that the forecasted continued recovery in semiconductor revenue and improving conditions in the U.S. economy would lead to significantly increased spending on EDA products by our
customers. However, by the end of our third fiscal quarter, it became clear that EDA spending growth was not tracking the upturn in the semiconductor industry.

We
believe EDA spending has not tracked the industry's recovery for a number of reasons. First, in light of the severity of the 2000-2002 downturn, we believe customers'
intense focus on expense reduction persists, and that they now generally approach spending more conservatively. In addition, the semiconductor industry's recovery has been driven primarily by the
consumer electronics market, where product price is a primary competitive factor, further increasing pressure on our customers to control costs, including by limiting their EDA spending.

In
addition to these broader trends, we believe our customers turned more cautious about their own business outlook in mid-calendar 2004 due to a number of factors, including
lack of visibility into their own future results, unexpected inventory buildup in the semiconductor supply chain and concerns about the industry's growth prospects in 2005. As a result, we believe our
customers became more reluctant to extend or increase their existing commitments to us and to agree to upfront payment terms for multi-year licenses. These developments materially and
adversely affected both our bookings and revenue for fiscal year 2004. In particular, lower than expected upfront license bookings adversely


impacted
our third quarter of fiscal 2004 results, since we recognize all revenue from upfront licenses in the quarter they are shipped. Lower than expected time-based license bookings
also adversely affected our results for the year and will adversely affect our future results, as a less-than-expected amount was added to our backlog to be recognized in
future periods.

Following
the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we re-evaluated customer demand for upfront licenses, which require customers to pay at least 75% of the license fee in the first
year. Our customers' increased preference for conserving cash by paying for licenses over time has made upfront payment terms a significantly more difficult negotiating issue. Accordingly, effective
in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, we shifted our target license mix to consist almost entirely of time-based licenses. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, upfront licenses constituted approximately 7%
of license orders, compared to an average of approximately 24% since our original introduction of time-based licenses in August 2000. This shift negatively impacted revenue,
earnings and cash flow from operations for the quarter as many orders which previously would have generated revenue, and in many cases cash, upfront instead were booked as TBLs, contributing primarily
to backlog for future quarters.

Our
results in the third quarter and the license mix shift in the fourth quarter resulted in lower revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.
In addition, due to our further license mix transition we expect revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 under the new model to be below the
comparable quarters under the old, higher upfront model in fiscal 2004. However, we believe making this transition meets our customers' needs while enabling us to better preserve the value of our
technology and enhance the predictability of our business.

We
continue to believe that, over the long-term, any growth in EDA spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor R&D spending and on continued growth in the
overall semiconductor market. The Semiconductor Industry Association has forecasted semiconductor revenues to be flat in 2005 and to grow modestly in 2006. Accordingly, and with our continuing license
model shift and our expectation of a relatively low level of major customer license renewals in fiscal 2005 based on scheduled renewal dates, we expect our revenue, earnings and cash flow from
operations for fiscal 2005 to be below fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2004 Financial Performance Summary

•

Orders
were $956 million versus $1,368 million in fiscal 2003, reflecting the trends and developments discussed above in "Fiscal 2004 Business Environment" and
the timing of a major contract renewal which was expected to be completed in fiscal 2004, but was not completed until the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. Our book-to-bill ratio in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was approximately 0.9 and 1.2, respectively.

•

Revenue
was $1,092 million, down 7% from fiscal 2003, due primarily to a lower level of orders than expected in the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, the shift in
license mix during the fourth quarter to an almost completely ratable model and a decrease in maintenance revenue.

•

Time-based
revenue increased 7% from fiscal 2003 to $663 million, primarily reflecting recognition of revenue on increased time-based orders
in fiscal 2003. Upfront license revenue declined 28% from $298 million to $216 million, due primarily to a lower-than-expected level of upfront license orders in
the third quarter and to the license model shift effective in the fourth quarter.

•

For
the year, we derived approximately 25% of our software revenue from upfront licenses and 75% from time-based licenses, versus approximately 33% and 67%,
respectively, during fiscal 2003. The percentage of software revenue from upfront licenses was 29% in the first half of the fiscal year and 20% in the second half of the fiscal year, reflecting
lower-than-expected upfront license bookings in the third quarter and the shift from upfront licenses to time-based licenses in the fourth quarter, each of which
translated into a reduction in the revenue from upfront license orders. Reflecting this shift, during the fourth quarter, approximately 90% of our revenue was derived from backlog attributable to
prior period time-based license bookings.

•

Maintenance
revenue declined by 23% from $220 million in fiscal 2003 to $170 million, primarily reflecting the lower-than-expected
level of upfront license orders, which led to a lower level of new maintenance orders, the shift of some upfront licenses to TSLs (under which maintenance is included with the license fee and
therefore is not reported separately), and non-renewal of maintenance by certain customers compared to fiscal 2003.

•

Professional
service and other revenue, at $43 million, increased slightly from $41 million for fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of customers' continued use
of outside consultants to augment their internal staff and to assist in implementing their advanced IC designs.

•

Net
income was $74 million compared to $150 million in the fiscal 2003, primarily due to lower revenue and other income, an increase in cost of services
revenues due to increased field support headcount and higher amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions.

•

Cash
provided by operations for fiscal 2004 was $264 million compared to $392 million for fiscal 2003, driven primarily by lower orders and reported revenues
compared to fiscal 2003, cash disbursements for foreign income taxes, higher general and administrative expenses and workforce realignment expenses.

•

We
repurchased 16.9 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2004 for approximately $423 million. In December 2004, after the end of the fiscal
year, our Board renewed the stock


buyback
program, restoring the authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock.

Fiscal 2004 Acquisitions

In fiscal 2004, we acquired (i) Accelerant Networks, Inc. (Accelerant) to enhance our standards-based IP solutions; (ii) Cascade
Semiconductors, Inc. (Cascade), to augment our IP portfolio of PCI Express products; and (iii) the technology assets of Analog Design Automation, Inc. (ADA) to expand our analog
and mixed-signal offerings. In addition, in fiscal 2004 we completed one additional acquisition and two additional asset acquisition transactions we do not consider material for financial statement
purposes. After the fiscal year end, we completed the acquisition of ISE Integrated Systems Engineering AG (ISE), broadening our TCAD product line and announced the proposed acquisition of Nassda
Corporation, which would settle our outstanding litigation and enhance our circuit simulation offerings.

Critical Accounting Policies

We base the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which we prepare in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing these financial statements, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

The
accounting policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:

•

Revenue
recognition;

•

Valuation
of intangible assets and goodwill;

•

Income
taxes; and

•

Allowance
for doubtful accounts.

Revenue Recognition.

We have designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with Statement of Position
(SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, as amended by

SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.

With
respect to software sales, during fiscal 2004, we utilized three license types:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses

(TSLs) are for a finite term, on average approximately three years, and generally provide
the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Maintenance is bundled for the term of the license and not purchased
separately.

•

Term Licenses

are also for a finite term, usually three years, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to
exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology.
Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license
fee.

•

Perpetual Licenses

, which continue as long as the customer renews maintenance, plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual
licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may
renew annually. The annual maintenance fee for purchases


under
$2 million is typically calculated as a percentage of the list price of the licensed software. For purchases over $2 million, the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as
a percentage of the net license fee.

We
sometimes refer to TSLs and term licenses, either individually or collectively, as "renewable licenses" because the customer must purchase an extension or a new license in order to
continue using the software after the specified term of the contract expires. In a renewal transaction, we may either replace the pre-existing arrangement with an entirely new arrangement
or maintain two agreements. Where we replace the existing agreement, we often supersede the original arrangement and thereafter deliver software and recognize revenue based upon the type of license
reflected in the new agreement. Where we maintain two agreements, we recognize revenue on the new incremental agreement based upon the new license type purchased. If we grant extended payment terms
(as discussed below), we recognize license revenue as payments become due and payable.

Customers
occasionally convert their existing TSLs to perpetual licenses, paying an incremental fee which we recognize upon contract signing in accordance with AICPA Technical Practice
Aid (TPA) 5100.73, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In some situations, the contract converting the TSL to a perpetual license is modified to such an extent that a new
arrangement exists. The changes to the contract may include increases or decreases in the total technology under license, changes in payment terms, changes in license terms and other pertinent
factors. In these situations, we account for all of the arrangement fee as a new sale and recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

We
report revenue in three categories: upfront license, time-based license and service.

Upfront
license revenue includes:

•

Perpetual licenses.

We recognize the perpetual license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment
terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. For perpetual licenses in which less than
75% of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable.

•

Upfront term licenses.

We recognize term license fees in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment terms
require the customer to pay at least 75% of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

Time-Based
License (TBL) revenue includes:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses.

We typically recognize revenue from TSL license fees (which include bundled
maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period. However, where we offer extended payment terms (i.e., where less than 75% of the TSL license fees are due within one year from shipment), we
recognize revenue from TSLs in an amount equal to the lesser of the ratable portion of the entire fee or customer installments as they become due and payable.

•

Term Licenses with Extended Payment Terms.

For term licenses where less than 75% of the term license fee is due
within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable.

Service
revenue includes:

•

Maintenance Fees Associated with Perpetual and Term Licenses.

We generally recognize revenue from maintenance
associated with perpetual and term licenses ratably over the maintenance term.

•

Professional Service Fees.

We generally recognize revenue from consulting and training services as services are
performed and accepted.


We
allocate revenue on software transactions (referred to as "arrangements") involving multiple elements to each element based on the respective fair values of the elements. Our
determination of fair value of each element is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold
separately.

We
have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our
perpetual and term license products and to consulting. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using
the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term and recognize consulting revenues as the related services are
performed.

We
make significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) our fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is probable. We apply these criteria as discussed
below.

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists

. Our customary practice is to have a written contract, signed by both the
customer and us, or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing
revenue on an arrangement.

•

Delivery Has Occurred

. We deliver software to our customers physically or electronically. For physical deliveries, our
standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or "keys" that allow the customer to take immediate
possession of software.

•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable

. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on
the arrangement's payment terms. Our standard payment terms require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year. Where these terms apply, we
regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and we recognize revenue upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the payment terms do not meet this standard, which we
refer to as "extended payment terms," we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, we
recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable, due to application of other revenue accounting guidelines relating to maintenance services and arrangements that include rights to
unspecified future technology.

•

Collectibility is Probable

. To recognize revenue, we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees, which we do on a
customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, we
evaluate the customer's financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful
collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer's payment history, we recognize revenue on a
cash-collected basis.

Valuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill.

We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer-installed
base/relationships, trademarks and tradenames, covenants not to compete, customer backlog, and other intangibles. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance
relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant


negative
industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the
asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the
remaining amortization period, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period. Any such impairment charge could be
significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2004. As of
October 31, 2004, the carrying amount of our intangible assets, net was $198.1 million.

We
evaluate aggregate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with Statement of
Financial Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142),

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill
may be impaired, we assess the impairment of the goodwill using the two-step method prescribed by SFAS 142. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material
adverse effect on our reported financial statements. We did not
record any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal 2004. As of October 31, 2004, the carrying amount of our goodwill was $593.7 million.

Income Taxes.

The relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate.
We are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate. As of October 31, 2004, current deferred tax assets, net of current deferred tax liabilities totaled
$125.6 million. Non-current deferred tax assets, net of non-current deferred tax liabilities, totaled $146.4 million. We believe it is more likely than not that
our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets. We consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance, and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would charge to income an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination.

We
provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the United States. As of
October 31, 2004, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $36.3 million.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

We estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable on an
account-by-account basis and establish a specific reserve for any particular receivable when we determine collectibility is not probable. In addition, we provide a general
reserve on all accounts receivable, which we calculate as a percentage, determined within a specified range of percentages of the outstanding balance in each aged group. In determining this
percentage, we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt expense, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, international exposures (such as currency devaluation), and
changes in our customer payment terms to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, impairing their ability to make
payments, we may need to establish additional allowances. As of October 31, 2004, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $7.1 million.


Results of Operations

Revenue Background

We generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses, maintenance and professional services. As a result of the application of accounting rules and policies
relating to revenue recognition,

orders

we receive for software licenses and services turn into

revenue

on our income statements at varying rates. In general, orders for software licenses turn to revenue either at the time the license is shipped (an "upfront license"), or ratably over the term of the
license (a "time-based license"). Maintenance orders generally turn to revenue ratably over the maintenance period and professional service orders generally turn to revenue upon completion
of contractually agreed upon milestones. A more complete description of our revenue recognition policies can be found above under

Critical Accounting
Policies.

Our

revenue

in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our upfront license revenue, time-based license revenue, maintenance
revenue and professional service revenue.

Upfront license revenue

generally depends on the volume of upfront license orders shipped during the quarter.

Time-based
license

revenue in any quarter is derived almost entirely from TSL orders received and delivered in

prior

quarters; since our TSL orders generally yield revenue ratably over a
typical term of three years, a given TSL order contributes to revenue in the
quarter it is booked at most one-twelfth of its aggregate booking value.

Maintenance

revenue in any quarter is similarly derived largely
from maintenance orders received in

prior

quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a typical term of one year.
Finally,

Professional Service

revenue is also derived almost entirely from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from
professional services when those services are rendered, not when they are booked. Any order or portion thereof that does not turn to revenue in the quarter in which it is received is added to our
backlog and generally recognized in future periods. The components of our aggregate backlog are discussed further under Part I, Item 1.

Business-Sales, Distribution and
Backlog

above.

Given
the different revenue impacts of upfront licenses and TSLs, in any given fiscal quarter, our license revenue is very sensitive to the mix of upfront and time-based
licenses delivered during the quarter. A TSL order results in significantly

lower

current-period revenue than an equal-
sized order for an upfront license. Conversely, a TSL order will result in

higher

revenue recognized in future periods than an equal-sized order for an
upfront license. For example, on a $120,000 order for an upfront license, we recognize $120,000 of revenue in the quarter the product is shipped and no revenue in future quarters. On a $120,000 order
for a three-year TSL shipped on the last day of the quarter, we recognize no revenue in the quarter the product is shipped and $10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters. TSLs also
shift maintenance revenue to time-based revenue since maintenance is included in TSLs.

License Order Mix

Beginning in August 2000, when we adopted TSLs, we maintained a target license mix of approximately 75% TSLs and 25% upfront licenses, based on our
expectations of total orders and our assessment of the demand for upfront licenses, which have more front-loaded payment terms than TSLs. From August 2000 through the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004, our average license mix has been 76% time-based licenses and 24% upfront licenses, although the license mix has varied considerably from quarter to quarter. Our license order mix for
the last nine fiscal quarters is set forth below:

The percentage of upfront licenses is driven by a number of factors, including the level of overall license orders, customer demand, preferred
customer payment terms and requested customer ship


dates.
The percentages in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 reflect both lower-than-expected upfront orders and a substantially lower-than-expected
overall orders total.

As
described above under "Fiscal 2004 Business Environment," for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and beyond, we have adjusted our target license mix from approximately 75%
time-based licenses to an almost completely time-based license mix. The figures above for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reflect this shift in our target license mix.

Our
upfront and time-based license agreements sometimes provide the right to exchange a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified Synopsys
products. The customer's exchange of product, when so provided in the license agreement, does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer. However, because in such
cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to
licensing the individual products separately.

Orders

Total orders in fiscal 2004 were $956 million, a decrease from $1,368 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in orders reflects the trends and
developments discussed above in "Fiscal 2004 Business Environment" and the timing of a major contract renewal, which was expected to occur during fiscal 2004, but which was not completed until the
first quarter of fiscal 2005.

The decrease in total revenue for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to: (i) a lower level of orders than expected in
fiscal 2004; (ii) our shift in the fourth quarter to an almost completely ratable license model; and (iii) a decrease in maintenance revenue. The increase in total revenue for fiscal
2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to: (i) contribution of products from the Avant! acquisition, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2002, for all of fiscal 2003;
(ii) continued phase-in of the ratable license model; and (iii) license renewals with many of our largest Japanese customers in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, a
relatively high proportion of which were perpetual licenses yielding upfront revenue.

With
our further shift in license mix beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we expect total reported revenue for the first three quarters and full fiscal year 2005 under the
new more ratable model to be below the comparable periods in fiscal 2004.

Since we adopted a license mix of approximately 25% upfront and 75% TBLs in August 2000, our time-based revenue has grown in
successive periods in both dollar and percentage terms as TBL orders


received
each fiscal period contribute revenue that is "layered" over the revenue recognized from TBL orders received in prior periods. This effect repeats itself each period in varying degrees until
the TBL model is fully phased in.

The
increase in time-based revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to this continued phase-in of our ratable license model and to the
full-year revenue contribution in fiscal 2004 from a strong level of time-based license orders received during fiscal 2003. The increase in time-based license
revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was similarly due primarily to the continued phase-in of the ratable license model and to the increased time-based license sales
contributed by Avant! products during the full fiscal year 2003.

With
our shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to an almost completely ratable license model, we expect an additional phase-in period during which our
time-based revenue should continue to increase in both dollar and percentage terms even if the overall level of TBL orders does not grow, and could grow even if the overall level of TBL
orders in any period declines. Over the long term, as we complete this further transition, time-based revenue should more closely track average time-based orders trends.

The decrease in upfront revenue for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the shift to a higher ratable license model in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and to lower-than-expected upfront orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Upfront license revenue for fiscal 2003 increased compared to
fiscal 2002 primarily due to the contribution of Avant! products for the full 2003 fiscal year and license renewals with many of our largest Japanese customers in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, a
relatively high proportion of which were perpetual licenses yielding upfront revenue. The percentage of revenue comprised of upfront licenses declined over the three-year period due to the
phasing in of our ratable license model begun in August 2000. With our further shift in license mix in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we expect upfront revenue to significantly decrease in
fiscal 2005 in both dollar and percentage terms.

Our maintenance fees have declined primarily due to our adoption of TSLs, which include maintenance with the license fee and thus contribute no
separately recognized maintenance fees. Other


factors
include the pricing of maintenance on perpetual license transactions above $2 million, which is substantially lower than the rates on standard perpetual licenses, and
non-renewal of maintenance by certain customers. With our license model shift, we expect more of our maintenance revenue to be included in our overall TSL revenue, and therefore for our
separately recognized maintenance revenue to continue to decline.

Professional
service fees grew approximately 5% from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 as customers continued to use our professional services personnel to augment their internal staff and to
assist in implementing their advanced IC designs. Professional service revenue decreased significantly from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003, reflecting reduced demand for turnkey chip design services.

During
the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004, consulting capacity constraints and pricing pressure from customers and competitors constrained our professional service revenue
growth. We expect these factors to continue to impact professional service revenue in fiscal 2005.

Service
revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, has posted steady decreases over the past three years due primarily to the inclusion of maintenance services in TSLs described above.

Orders and Revenue Seasonality.

Historically, our orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our
fourth quarter, with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first quarter of the next fiscal year, although the timing of major license renewals can alter this
typical trend. In our license model, revenue seasonality has historically resulted principally from the decline in the amount of upfront orders from the fourth quarter of one fiscal year to the first
quarter of the next fiscal year. Going forward, however, we expect our shift to an almost completely ratable license model will significantly reduce revenue seasonality.

Product Groups.

For management reporting purposes, we organize our
products and services into five distinct groups: Galaxy Design Platform, Discovery Verification Platform, Intellectual Property (IP), Design for Manufacturing and Professional Services & Other.
The products and services in these groups are described in detail under Part I, Item 1.

Business,

above.

The
following table summarizes the revenue attributable to these groups as a percentage of total revenue for the last eight quarters. We include revenue from companies or products we
have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods. For presentation purposes, we allocate software maintenance revenue, which represented
approximately
16% and 19% of our total revenue for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively, to the products to which those support services related. Further, with the adoption of our platform strategy in fiscal
2003, we redefined our product groups and have reclassified prior period revenues in accordance with this grouping to provide a consistent presentation.

The respective revenue contributions from our different groups has been relatively stable over the eight-quarter period shown in the table above.
This stability is principally due to the fact that most of our customers purchase multiple products from us, and do so under TSLs, for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license.
Accordingly, significant changes in revenue contribution


from
different groups have been driven primarily by one-time events, such as acquisitions, or by the mix of upfront versus time-based orders received for certain products
during a given quarter.

For
example, our Galaxy Design Platform revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 due to a number of large perpetual licenses with our
Japanese customers, many of which included a disproportionate amount of products from the Galaxy Design Platform, yielding significant upfront revenue contributions from that product group for that
quarter. Similarly, the percentage of revenue from our IP products rose significantly in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of increased sales of upfront IP licenses during that quarter.

While
we expect our TSL licensing model will continue to lessen quarter-to-quarter variations in revenue in the near-term, we believe our IP and
Design for Manufacturing products will, over time, account for increasing
percentages of total revenue as a result of our customers' greater acceptance of and reliance upon pre-designed, pre-verified IP components and tools and technologies needed
for the manufacture of very small geometry ICs.

Events Affecting Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses

Temporary Shutdown of Operations.

As a cost saving measure, we temporarily shut down operations in North America for three
days during the first quarter of fiscal 2004, four days during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and four days during the third quarter of fiscal 2003, resulting in savings of approximately
$7.6 million in fiscal 2004 and $4.8 million in fiscal 2003. Operations were not shut down for any days in fiscal 2002. The savings in fiscal 2004 and 2003 relate primarily to salaries
and benefits and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows:

Workforce Reduction.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and the second quarter of fiscal
2002 we reduced expenses by decreasing the number of employees in most departments in domestic and foreign locations. This workforce reduction affected approximately 84 employees in fiscal 2004 (50
employees in the U.S. and 34 employees outside the U.S.), 200 employees in fiscal 2003 (130 employees in the U.S. and 70 employees outside the U.S.) and 175 employees in fiscal 2002 (137 employees in
the U.S. and 38 employees outside the U.S.), resulting in charges of approximately $6.6 million in fiscal 2004, $4.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $3.9 million in fiscal 2002. The


charges
in each fiscal year relate primarily to severance and other special termination benefits and are included in our consolidated financial statements as follows:

realigned our operations to focus resources on more strategic areas of investment and to become more operationally efficient. This realignment affected a total of 140 employees in the United States
and 100 employees outside the United States, in most departments. Charges for severance and other termination benefits totaling $14.9 million were reflected in our consolidated financial
statements for fiscal 2003 as follows.

Cost of revenue includes personnel and related costs to provide product support, consulting services and training. Cost of revenue also includes
software production costs, product packaging, documentation, amortization of capitalized software development costs, and amortization of core/developed technology and other intangible assets as
described below. Management allocates these expenses, most of which are relatively fixed and do not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or license mix, to cost of upfront licenses, cost of
time-based licenses and cost of services, based on the mix of orders booked within a given period.

The
increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to: (i) an increase in amortization of $9.7 million of core/developed technology
recorded as a result of our acquisitions completed in fiscal 2003 and 2004; (ii) an increase of $9.1 million in field support personnel costs due to targeted hiring in the customer
support function; and (iii) increased human resources, technology and facilities costs of $3.6 million as a result of the increase in cost of revenue headcount as a percentage of total
headcount. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of


(i) $1.1 million
in consulting services; (ii) $2.6 million as discussed above under

Workforce Realignment

; and
(iii) $1.1 million in royalty expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased due to lower revenue during 2004 and
increased amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation from acquisitions in fiscal 2003.

The
increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to: (i) an increase of $58.9 million in amortization of intangible assets and
deferred stock compensation recorded as a result of our acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and 2002; (ii) the cost of our realignment of operations totaling $2.6 million as discussed above
under

Workforce Realignment;

and (iii) additional royalties for in-licensed technology of $1.5 million.

We
expect cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation allocated to this line item, to increase slightly in fiscal 2005 as a result of
increased headcount from acquisitions during fiscal 2004 and higher targeted incentive compensation. We also expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2005 to increase (and gross
margin to decrease) due to the expected increase in cost of revenue described above and the expected decrease in revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004.

See

Amortization of Intangible Assets and Deferred Stock Compensation

below for information regarding the amount of amortization charged
to cost of revenue for the relevant periods.

Operating Expenses

Functional Allocation of Operating Expenses

Historically, we allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on
headcount within the functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (as in the case of a workforce reduction or realignment) and other factors, management reviews the allocation
methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool. Management conducted such a review with respect to Synopsys' workforce reductions in fiscal 2002 and 2003 and the workforce realignment in
fiscal 2004 and with respect to additional expenses from certain worldwide IT and facility programs implemented during fiscal 2002. The resulting expense allocations generally contribute significantly
to the fluctuations in functional area expenses from year to year.

The slight decrease in research and development expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 reflects an increase of $10.1 million in
research and development personnel and related costs as a result of increased investment in research and development activities, offset by: (i) decreased depreciation of $2.2 million as
a result of overall decreased capital spending and lower replacement costs compared to fiscal 2003; (ii) severance packages totaling $1.4 million associated with our workforce reduction
during fiscal 2003 which were not incurred during fiscal 2004; (iii) a decrease of $1.6 million in consulting services compared to fiscal 2003; and (iv) a reduction of
$4.5 million in North America human resources, information technology and facilities costs allocated to research and development expenses as a result of the decrease in research and development
headcount as a percentage of total headcount.


The
increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to increases of: (i) $30.7 million in research and development
personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003, including additional employer payroll taxes incurred as a result of stock option exercises during fiscal 2003;
(ii) $22.2 million in increased human resources, information technology and facilities costs allocated to research and development as a result of the increase in research and development
headcount as a percentage of total headcount; and (iii) $6.3 million as a result of our realignment of operations as discussed above under

Workforce
Realignment.

This increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $2.8 million as a result of capital expenditure control measures implemented in
fiscal 2003 and $2.3 million in consulting services incurred in fiscal 2002 that were not incurred in fiscal 2003.

We
expect research and development expense to increase slightly in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased headcount from acquisitions during fiscal 2004 and higher targeted incentive
compensation. We also expect research and development expense as a percentage of revenue to increase due to the expected increase in research and development expense described above and the expected
decrease in revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004.

The decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to: (i) a reduction of
$4.0 million in variable compensation, driven by reduced orders and shipments in fiscal 2004; (ii) a reduction of $3.0 million in sales and marketing personnel and related costs
as a result of decreased headcount due to previous workforce reductions and realignments; and (iii) $4.8 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our
realignment of operations as discussed above under

Workforce Realignment

. This decrease is partially offset by increases of
(i) $4.4 million in human resources, information technology and facilities costs allocated to sales and marketing expenses as a result of the increase in sales and marketing headcount as
a percentage of total headcount and (ii) $1.2 million related to expanded marketing efforts and charges associated with the cancellation of certain employee-related functions.

The
increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to: (i) $42.4 million in additional sales and marketing personnel and
related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003, including additional employer payroll taxes incurred as a result of stock option exercises during fiscal 2003, offset by savings from
a four-day shutdown of operations in North America; (ii) $4.8 million as a result of realignment charges as discussed above under

Workforce
Realignment;

and (iii) $2.7 million in additional travel expenses related to sales efforts.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million in human resources, technology and facilities costs allocated to sales and marketing expenses as a result of a decrease in
sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount.

We
expect sales and marketing expense to increase slightly in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased headcount from acquisitions during fiscal 2004 and higher targeted incentive
compensation. We also expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue to increase due to the expected increase in research and development expense and the expected decrease in revenue in
fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004.

The increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to: (i) the
$10.0 million termination fee paid to Monolithic System Technology, Inc. (MoSys) in connection with termination of the acquisition agreement in April 2004 and professional service
fees of $5.4 million relating to that transaction and the subsequent litigation; (ii) an increase of $5.0 million in professional service fees relating to other litigation
matters; (iii) $4.7 million in facilities costs primarily related to planned facilities consolidation in fiscal 2004; (iv) a loss of $1.1 million related to the sublease of
a portion of our Ireland headquarter facility; and (v) a $3.5 million increase in depreciation due to increased capital spending in information technology. This increase was partially
offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in human resources, information technology and facilities costs reported under this line item as a result of a decrease in general and administrative
headcount as a percentage of total headcount.

The
increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to: (i) $12.8 million in additional general and administrative
personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003, including additional employer taxes incurred as a result of stock option exercises during fiscal 2003;
(ii) $7.0 million increase in depreciation as a result of upgrades to our information technology infrastructure; (iii) an increase of $5.7 million in facilities costs
allocated to general and administrative expense due to new leases during the current year and the expiration of a sublease on one of Synopsys' buildings in June 2003; (iv) an increase of
$3.7 million in professional services costs, patent prosecution expenditures and litigation; (v) an increase of $2.8 million in maintenance agreements covering software and
computing equipment obtained in acquisitions during fiscal 2002 and 2003; and (vi) $1.2 million related to the realignment of operations as discussed above under

Workforce Realignment

. These
increases were partially offset by decreases of (i) $14.2 million in human resources, technology and
facilities costs allocated to general and administrative expenses as a result of a decrease in general and administrative headcount as a percentage of total headcount; and (ii) a reduction of
$6.6 million in bad debt expense as accounts receivable aging improved from fiscal 2002.

We
expect general and administrative expense to be flat or decrease slightly in fiscal 2005 as a result of continuing cost controls and the absence of certain one-time
charges such as those associated with the MoSys transaction, partially offset by higher targeted incentive compensation. However, we expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of
revenue to increase due to the expected decrease in revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004.

Integration Costs.

Non-recurring integration costs incurred relate to merger activities which are not included in
the purchase consideration under Emerging Issues Task Force Number 95-3 (EITF 95-3),

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business
Combination

. These costs are expensed as incurred. During fiscal 2002, integration costs were $128.5 million and consisted primarily of: (i) $95.0 million
related to the premium for the insurance policy expensed in conjunction with the Avant! merger; (ii) $14.7 million related to write-downs of Synopsys facilities and property under the
management approved facility exit plan for the Avant! merger; (iii) $10.7 million related to severance costs for Synopsys employees who were terminated and costs associated with
transition employees as a result of the fiscal 2002 mergers; (iv) $1.3 million related to the write-off of software licenses owned by Synopsys which were originally purchased
from Avant!; (v) $3.7 million goodwill impairment charge


related
to a prior Synopsys acquisition as a result of the acquisition of Avant!; and (vi) $3.1 million of other expenses including travel and certain professional fees related to the
fiscal 2002 mergers.

In-Process Research and Development

In fiscal 2004 purchased in-process research and development (IPRD) was $1.6 million and represents in-process technologies
associated with a fourth quarter acquisition considered immaterial for financial statement purposes. Purchased IPRD of $19.8 million and $87.7 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002,
respectively, represents in-process technologies associated with our acquisitions of Numerical in fiscal 2003 and Avant! and inSilicon in fiscal 2002. At the date of each acquisition, the
projects associated with the IPRD efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these amounts were
charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies.

Valuation of IPRD.

The value assigned to acquired in-process technology is determined by identifying products
under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date. The value of in-process technology is then segmented into two
classifications: (i) developed technology (completed) and (ii) in-process technology (to-be-completed), giving explicit consideration to the value
created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition and to be created by Synopsys after the acquisition. These value creation efforts were
estimated by considering the following major factors: (i) time-based data, (ii) cost-based data and (iii) complexity-based data.

The
value of the in-process technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach, focusing on the income producing capabilities of the
in-process technologies. Under this approach, the value is determined by estimating the
revenue contribution generated by each of the identified products within the classification segments. Revenue estimates were based on (i) individual product revenues, (ii) anticipated
growth rates, (iii) anticipated product development and introduction schedules, (iv) product sales cycles, and (v) the estimated life of a product's underlying technology. From
the revenue estimates, operating expense estimates, including costs of sales, general and administrative, sales and marketing, income taxes and a use charge for contributory assets, were deducted to
arrive at operating income. Revenue growth rates were estimated by management for each product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected industry trends, the
anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors, individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product's underlying technology. Operating expense
estimates reflect Synopsys' historical expense ratios. Additionally, these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial
feasibility. The resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition.

The
rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased in-process technology is our weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), taking into account our required rates of
return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the acquired in-process technology, the useful life of such technology, the profitability levels of such technology, if any, and the uncertainty of technological
advances, all of which are unknown at this time.

Numerical.

On March 1, 2003, we acquired Numerical, which specialized in subwavelength
lithography-enabling solutions. The IPRD expense related to the Numerical acquisition was $18.3 million. Numerical had five IPRD projects—Phase Shift Masking (PSM), Subwavelength
Software, Equipment Software, Cadabra and Computer Aided Transcription System (CATS)—representing 25%, 7%, 6%, 5% and 57%, respectively, of the total IPRD value. These projects were


expected
to be completed shortly following the completion of the merger. PSM, Subwavelength Software and CATS software were completed in fiscal 2003. Our Cadabra® product was released in
the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Equipment Software project consists of in-process technology for multiple products. These products were either completed in fiscal 2003, discontinued,
or were integrated with other Synopsys products during fiscal 2004. Expenditures to complete Numerical's acquired in-process technologies approximated the original estimates.

inSilicon.

On September 20, 2002, we acquired inSilicon, a leading provider of
connectivity semiconductor IP used by semiconductor and systems companies to design SoCs that are critical components of innovative wired and wireless products. The IPRD expense related to the
inSilicon acquisition was $5.2 million. inSilicon had three IPRD projects—DELA, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express and Universal Serial Business Physical (USB
PHY)—accounting for 54%, 23% and 23% of the total IPRD value, respectively. These projects were 25%, 67% and 20% complete at the time of acquisition, respectively. During fiscal 2003,
Synopsys decided to discontinue the DELA project. PCI Express and USB PHY have been completed. Expenditures to complete inSilicon's acquired in-process technologies approximated the
original estimates.

Avant!.

On June 6, 2002, we acquired Avant!, a leading developer of software used in the
physical design and physical verification stages of IC design. The IPRD expense related to the Avant! merger was $82.5 million. The principal in-process technologies were identified
based on the following product families:

expectations.

Amortization of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Deferred Stock Compensation.

Amortization of intangible assets and deferred
stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights intangible associated with certain executory contracts, core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships,
covenants not to compete and other intangibles acquired in business combinations completed during fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives, which range from three to ten years. Deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with prior year acquisitions. The
deferred stock compensation is amortized over the options' remaining vesting period of one to three years. Generally, amortization of deferred stock compensation will decrease over time as the assumed
stock options vest, although employee terminations affect the exact timing and


amount
of future amortization of deferred stock compensation. Amortization expense for these assets is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:

The increase in amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due to additional
amortization of assets acquired in the Numerical acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 partially offset by the declining amounts of amortization related to deferred compensation recorded in
prior year acquisitions. See Note 4 to

Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements

for a schedule of future amortization amounts.

The
increase in amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to fiscal 2003 and 2002 acquisitions, particularly
Avant!, partially offset by a $16.2 million decrease in goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142 on November 1, 2002 under which goodwill is no longer
amortized.

Impairment of Intangible Assets.

There were no material impairment charges related to intangible assets during fiscal 2004
and 2003.

In
fiscal 2002, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $3.8 million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions to their
estimated fair value. Approximately $3.7 million and $0.1 million are included in integration expense and amortization of intangible assets, respectively, on the consolidated statement
of operations. The impairment charge is primarily attributable to the Route Compiler technology acquired from, and goodwill related to, the acquisition of Stanza, Inc. (Stanza) in 1999. During
fiscal 2002, we determined that we would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology as products acquired in the merger with Avant! provided customers with superior
capabilities. As a result, we do not anticipate any future sales of the Stanza product.

Expensing of Stock Awards.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), which will be effective in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005. SFAS 123R will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans. Synopsys currently uses the
intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to its employees. Under this standard, we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we
issue under our stock option plans or related to the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans. Under the new rules, we are required to adopt a fair-value-based method
for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards; this will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and therefore will have a material adverse effect on our reported
results of operations. Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair-value-based method similar
to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002.


Operating Margin

Our operating margin declined from approximately 17% in fiscal 2003 to approximately 8% in fiscal 2004, primarily due to the decrease in revenue year over year.
As a result of the expected decrease in revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and the expected increase in overall operating expenses described above, we expect our operating margin in fiscal
2005 to be meaningfully lower than in fiscal 2004.

The
decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to reduced investment gains and reduced rental income. The increase in 2003 compared to
2002 was primarily due to the $240.8 million expense in 2002 related to the settlement of the Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (Cadence) litigation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our source of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments over the last three years has been from funds generated from our business, including
cash on hand from companies we have acquired. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $119.4 million, or 17%, to $579.0 million as of October 31,
2004 from $698.4 million as of October 31, 2003.

Cash
provided by operations was $264.0 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $391.5 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in cash from operations was driven in part by lower
orders and reported revenues in
fiscal 2004, as well as by increased use of operating cash as follows: (i) cash disbursements for foreign income taxes of approximately $44.7 million; (ii) payment of
$15.4 million for the MoSys acquisition agreement termination fee and associated litigation costs; (iii) disbursements associated with our fiscal 2003 workforce realignment of
approximately $15 million; (iv) payments of international value added taxes of approximately $8 million; and (v) increased prepaid maintenance contract expenses for our
design and information systems electronic infrastructure. These uses of cash were partially offset by income tax refunds of $28.6 million.

Accounts
receivable, net of allowances, decreased $68.7 million, or 34%, to $132.3 million as of October 31, 2004 from $201.0 million as of October 31,
2003. Days sales outstanding (DSO), calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date, decreased to 53 days as of October 31,
2004 from 58 days as of October 31, 2003. The decrease in accounts receivable and DSO was attributable to a $100.7 million reduction in new billings caused by lower orders during
fiscal 2004 and longer customer payment terms compared to fiscal 2003, partially offset by a $39.0 million decrease in collections compared to the prior fiscal year.

Cash
provided by operations is in part dependent upon the payment terms on our license agreements. For an upfront license, we require that at least 75% of the license fee be paid within
the first year. Conversely, payment terms for time-based licenses are generally extended; typically the license fee is paid quarterly in even increments over the term of the license.
Accordingly, we generally


receive
cash from upfront licenses sooner than on time-based licenses. Our lower-than-expected level of up-front orders in the third quarter of fiscal
2004 and further transition to an almost completely ratable license model beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reduced our cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004; we expect this further
transition to continue to adversely affect cash flow from operations during fiscal 2005.

Cash
used in investing activities was $172.0 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $258.3 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease of $86.3 million is primarily due to a
substantial decrease of cash used for acquisitions and decreased proceeds from the sale of long-term investments.

Cash
used in financing activities was $266.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $74.2 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease of
$340.8 million is primarily due to a decrease in proceeds of $178.2 million from the sale of shares pursuant to our employee stock option plans and stock purchase plans during fiscal
2004 and increased purchases of treasury stock of $162.6 million.

We
hold our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and in foreign accounts, primarily in Ireland, Bermuda, and Japan. As of October 31,
2004, we held an
aggregate of $202.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and an aggregate of $376.4 million in foreign accounts. Funds in foreign
accounts are generated from revenue outside North America. With the exception of Japan, we currently maintain a policy under APB 23,

Accounting for Income Taxes-Special
Areas

, of permanently reinvesting such funds outside of the United States.

In
April 2004, we entered into a three-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility contains financial covenants requiring us
to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on April 28, 2007. Borrowings under the facility
bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent's prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar
rates plus a spread between 0.80% and 1.125% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.20% and 0.25% per annum
based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In April 2004, we borrowed and repaid $200 million under the credit facility. As of October 31, 2004, we had no outstanding
borrowings under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants.

In
November 2004, Synopsys completed its acquisition of ISE for cash consideration of $100 million.

On
November 30, 2004, Synopsys signed a merger agreement to acquire Nassda Corporation in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $7.00 per share. The
aggregate consideration is approximately $192 million. At September 30, 2004, Nassda reported cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $101.4 million. The
transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. In addition, the approval of Nassda's stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Nassda common
stock and approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Nassda common stock casting votes affirmatively or negatively on the merger agreement (excluding Nassda's officers and
directors, the individual defendants and the related parties of the individual defendants) is required for Nassda and Synopsys to complete the proposed merger. Certain directors, officers and
employees of Nassda who own in the aggregate approximately 60% of Nassda's outstanding common shares have agreed to vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement. Upon the closing
of the acquisition, the Nassda officers, directors and employees who are defendants in the litigation between Synopsys and Nassda will make settlement payments to Synopsys in the aggregate amount of
approximately $61 million.


We
believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next
twelve months.

Purchase
obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of
October 31, 2004. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our
business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

Does
not include $750,000 of interest payable for bond payable through September 2023. Additional information is provided in Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain
long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenue, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future.

(5)

We
made or are committed to making additional cash expenditures in fiscal 2005 related to business combination transactions; specifically, $95 million related to the acquisition of
ISE, net of cash held by ISE, which was paid in November 2004, and approximately $192 million related to the acquisition of Nassda Corporation, which transaction has not closed. Additional information
is provided in Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These acquisition payments are not included in the table above.

(6)

We
are obligated under the contingent consideration provisions related to certain fiscal 2004 business combination transactions to make cash payments of up to $15.0 million through
fiscal 2007 if certain technology and performance milestones are achieved. Additional information is provided in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in connection with the
ISE acquisition, which occurred in November 2004, we are obligated to make additional cash payments of up to $20.0 million through fiscal 2007 if certain performance milestones are achieved.
Additional information is provided in Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The contingent consideration payments are not included in the table above.

The
expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the
time of


receipt
of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone-based obligations are dependent on the achievement of the
milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly.

Stock Option Plans

Under our 1992 Stock Option Plan (the 1992 Plan), 38,951,016 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1992 Plan, the Board of
Directors (the Board) may grant either incentive or non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock to employees and consultants, excluding non-employee
directors at not less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1992 Plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire ten years
from the date of grant. As of October 31, 2004, 8,284,470 stock options remain outstanding and 7,128,810 shares of common stock are reserved for future grants under this plan.

Under
our 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan), 53,247,068 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1998 Plan, the Board may
grant non-qualified stock options to employees and consultants, excluding executive officers and directors. Exercisability, option price and other terms are determined by the Board but the
option price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1998 Plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire
seven to ten years from the date of grant. As of October 31, 2004, 26,150,004 stock options remain outstanding and 5,460,416 shares of common stock were reserved for future grants under this
plan.

Under
our 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan), 2,100,000 shares were authorized for issuance. The Directors Plan provided for automatic grants
to each non-employee member of the Board upon initial appointment or election to the Board, upon reelection and for annual service on Board committees. The option price was not less than
100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Under the Directors Plan, as originally adopted, new directors received an option for 40,000 shares, vesting in equal installments over
four years. In addition, each continuing director who was elected at an annual meeting of stockholders received an option for 20,000 shares and an additional option for 10,000 shares for each Board
committee membership, up to a maximum of two committee service grants per year. In August 2003, the Board amended the Directors Plan in order to reduce the size of the initial and committee
grants to 30,000 and 5,000 shares, respectively. The annual and committee service option grants vest in full on the date immediately prior to the date of the annual meeting following their grant,
assuming continued board or committee service through such date. In the case of directors appointed to the Board between annual meetings, the annual and any committee grants were prorated based upon
the amount of time since the last annual meeting. The Directors Plan expired as to future grants in October 2004; as of October 31, 2004, 1,297,660 stock options remain outstanding. With
the expiration of the Directors Plan, we expect to seek stockholder approval of a new plan for non-employee directors at our 2005 annual meeting of stockholders.

We
have assumed certain option plans in connection with acquisitions. Generally, the options granted under these plans have terms similar to our own options. The exercise prices of such
options have been adjusted to reflect the relative exchange ratios. We do not intend to make future grants out of these option plans.

We
monitor dilution related to our option program by comparing net option grants in a given fiscal period to the number of shares outstanding. The dilution percentage is calculated as
the new option grants for the fiscal period, net of options forfeited by employees leaving Synopsys, divided by the total outstanding shares at the end of such fiscal period. The option dilution
percentages were 2.2% and 0.9% for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In
accordance with the rules of the SEC, the columns referring to potential realizable value show the gains or "option spreads" that would exist for the options granted based on the
assumed rates of annual compound stock price appreciation of 5% and 10% from the date the option was granted over the full option term. These estimated rates do not represent our estimate or
projection of future common stock prices or of the gains that may actually be realized by the optionee.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Weakness, budgetary caution or consolidation in the semiconductor and electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our business.

We generate substantially all of our revenue from the semiconductor and electronics industries. Beginning in late calendar 2000, the semiconductor industry
entered its steepest and longest downturn of the past 20 years. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the semiconductor industry grew by 18% in 2003 and is expected to grow
approximately 29% in 2004. Historically, growth in semiconductor sales has been followed by growth in semiconductor R&D spending, which in turn
has led to growth in EDA expenditures. However, to date, EDA industry revenue has not tracked the recovery in semiconductor sales and more moderate increases in R&D spending, and current SIA reports
forecast flat semiconductor sales in 2005. These factors adversely affected our results of operations during fiscal 2004 and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations into fiscal
2005.

We
believe that, over the long term, growth in EDA spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor R&D spending and of the overall semiconductor market. However, we cannot
predict the timing or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues, R&D spending or spending on EDA products, nor whether we will benefit from any such increases should they occur. If such growth
does not occur or if we do not benefit from any such increases, our business, operating results and financial condition will continue to be materially and adversely affected.

The failure to meet the semiconductor industry's demands for advancing EDA technology and continued cost reductions may adversely affect our financial results

SoC and IC functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease, in turn substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of IC design and
manufacturing. To address greater complexity, semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from EDA suppliers, including Synopsys. At the same time, as a result of pricing
pressure on their own products and the 2000-2002 downturn, customers and potential customers also seek to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort
to reduce cost and risk. In order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully address our customers' demands for significant R&D investments by us to meet their technology requirements, while
also striving to reduce their overall costs. Failure to manage successfully these conflicting demands would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.


The decline in new IC design starts, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may adversely affect the EDA industry, including
demand for our products and services.

The 2000-2002 downturn, the increasing complexity of SoCs and ICs, and customers' concerns about managing cost and risk have also led to the following
potentially long-term negative trends:

•

The
number of starts of new IC designs has declined. New IC design starts are a key driver of demand for EDA software.

•

Fewer
new companies engaged in semiconductor design are being formed or funded, and demand from existing small and medium-sized semiconductor companies has been soft. These
companies have traditionally been an important source of new business for us. As a result, we have become more reliant on our established customer base for new orders.

•

A
number of partnerships and mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred, and more are likely. Partnerships and mergers can reduce the aggregate
level of purchases of EDA software and services, and in some cases, increase customers' bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including Synopsys.

•

Industry
changes, plus the cost and complexity of IC design, may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general, to focus only on
one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design, or to design using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), an alternative chip technology.

These
trends, if sustained, could have a material adverse effect on the EDA industry, including the demand for our products and services, which in turn would materially and adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.

The EDA industry is highly competitive, and competition may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.

We compete with other EDA vendors that offer a broad range of products and services, such as Cadence Design Systems and Mentor Graphics Corporation, and with EDA
vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process, such as Magma Design Automation, Inc., which has grown rapidly in recent years and gained a
meaningful position in one of our core segments. We also compete with customers' internally developed design tools and capabilities. If we fail to compete effectively, our business will be materially
and adversely affected.

We
compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), time-to-results,
post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and payment terms. Additional competitive challenges include the following:

•

Technology
in the EDA industry evolves rapidly. Accordingly, we must correctly anticipate and lead critical developments, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our
existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products. If we fail to do so, competing technologies may reduce demand for our products and services.

•

To
compete effectively, we believe we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product
performance. Doing so requires significant engineering and development work. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue offering complete design flows in configurations our customers
will find more attractive than our competitors' offerings or that our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance will be successful.

•

Our
major initiatives face intense competition and in some cases address emerging markets. We are investing significant resources into further development of the Galaxy
Design Platform,


integration
of the Discovery Verification Platform and enhancement of its System Verilog features and development of our DFM and IP portfolios. It is difficult for us to predict the success of these
initiatives. If we fail to expand revenue from our new initiatives at the desired rate, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.

•

Price
is an important competitive factor. Customers require a mix of price and tool performance that suits their needs; in some cases this may lead them to choose vendors
based on price more than performance. In certain situations we must offer substantial discounts on our products due to competitive factors. As a result, average prices for our products may decline.
Alternatively, we may lose potential business to a lower price competitor. In either case, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

•

Payment
terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated by our customers. During the second half of fiscal 2003 and continuing through 2004,
payment terms on time-based licenses lengthened compared to prior periods, negatively affecting our cash flow from operations. In addition, customers' reluctance to agree to the payment
terms required
under our upfront licenses negatively impacted our revenue for the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004, and was a primary factor in our decision to shift our target license mix to an almost completely
ratable business model. Since cash is collected sooner on an upfront license than on a time-based license, the shift in our license mix towards more time-based licenses will
adversely affect our cash flow in fiscal 2005.

Our revenue and earnings fluctuate, which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock price to decline.

Many factors affect our revenue and earnings, including customer demand, license mix and the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold, making
it difficult to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period. Accordingly, stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance. As
demonstrated following our third fiscal quarter of 2004 if our financial results or targets do not meet investor and analyst expectations, our stock price could decline.

The
following are some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods:

•

Beginning
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we shifted our target license mix to consist almost entirely of time-based licenses. Time-based
licenses yield less current period revenue and more future period revenue than upfront licenses. The license mix shift decreased revenue for fiscal 2004 and will result in
year-over-year declines in revenue during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2005, and lower revenue for the full fiscal 2005 than in fiscal 2004.

•

Our
revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time-based licenses. The
amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to customer requirements, application of accounting rules regarding revenue recognition and competitive pressures could have a material adverse
effect on our revenue and earnings. For example, if we ship more upfront licenses than expected during any given fiscal period, our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even
if orders are below target; conversely, if we ship fewer upfront licenses than expected our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our
target. Similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of TBL orders during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected.


•

Under
certain circumstances, we provide customers with the right to exchange a portion of the software they initially license for other specified Synopsys products. For
example, a customer may use our front-end design products for a portion of the term of its license and then exchange such products for back-end placement software for the
remainder of the term in order to complete the customer's IC design. While this practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of these
arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately without exchange rights.

•

In
the past, we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. The delay of one or more
orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings for that quarter.

•

Our
customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision. Accordingly, our
customers' evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters. Further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approval or project starts because of
budgetary constraints or their budget cycles.

•

We
base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized. Since only
a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income.

Businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project.

We have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years, including six transactions in fiscal 2004 and three transactions in fiscal 2003, and, as
part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings, we expect to acquire additional companies.

In
addition to direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including:

•

Potential
dilution of our earnings per share;

•

Problems
in integrating the acquired products with our products;

•

Difficulties
in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company;

•

Challenges
in ensuring acquired products meet our quality standards;

•

Failure
to realize expected synergies or cost savings;

•

Failure
of acquired products to achieve projected sales;

•

Drain
on management time for acquisition-related activities;

•

Adverse
effects on customer buying patterns or relationships; and

•

Assumption
of unknown liabilities.

While
we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us, we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will have a positive effect on
our future performance. Furthermore, if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we could be required to write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated
with such product or technology; these write-downs, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.


Stagnation of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations or other international issues could adversely affect our performance.

During fiscal 2004 and 2003, we derived 45% and 43% of our revenue, respectively, from outside North America; going forward, we expect our overall orders and
revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial contributions from outside North America. Foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions,
including the effects of international political conflict and hostilities. Further, any stagnation of foreign economies could adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived
from outside North America.

Our
operating results are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations can be adversely affected when, as has been the case in recent months,
the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, particularly the Euro, the Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar, as a result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign
operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar. Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we hedge certain foreign currency exposures of our business, we can provide no assurance that our hedging
transactions will be effective.

A failure to recruit and retain key employees would have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete.

To be successful, we must attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join Synopsys in connection with acquisitions.
There are a limited number of qualified EDA
and IC design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. In addition, a substantial portion of our outstanding stock options held by employees had exercise prices above the market
price of our stock, which has decreased their value as an employee retention tool. As a result, we could experience higher employee turnover. Our employees, including employees who have joined
Synopsys in connection with acquisitions, are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. Our failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees would
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We
issue stock options and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. There is growing pressure on public companies from shareholders
generally and various organizations to reduce the rate at which companies, including Synopsys, issue stock options to employees, which may make it more difficult to obtain stockholder approval of our
equity compensation plans when required. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that will require us to
adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.We believe expensing
stock options will increase shareholder pressure to limit future option grants. Any of these factors could make it more difficult for us to grant stock options to employees or maintain our employee
stock purchase plans in the future. As a result, we may lose top employees to non-public, start-up companies or may generally find it more difficult to attract, retain and
motivate employees, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Customer payment defaults could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our backlog consists principally of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. These customer
obligations are typically not cancelable, but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults and fails to pay amounts owed. In these cases, we will generally take legal
action to recover amounts owed. Moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in


their
own businesses. Though we have not, to date, experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

A failure to protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. To protect this technology, we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and
on intellectual property laws worldwide. We can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not
otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. Moreover, certain foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property; our ability to
prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. We have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or
use our products and technologies. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. If we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection,
for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely
affected. In addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy and expensive and legal fees related to such litigation may reduce our net income.

From time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights.

Under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party's
intellectual property rights. As a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. For example, we are currently defending some of our
customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue
this defense.

These
types of claims can, however, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions
restricting our sale of products, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to changes in financial accounting standards, which may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business.

Accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations, significantly affecting the way we license our
products. Future changes in financial accounting standards, including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition, may have a significant
effect on our reported results, including reporting of transactions completed before the effective date of the changes.

In
December 2004, FASB issued statement of Financial Accounting standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), which will be effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. SFAS 123R will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plans. Synopsys currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to our employees. Under this standard, we generally
do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issue under our stock


option
plans or the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans. Under the new rules, we are required to adopt a fair value-based method for measuring the compensation expense related
to employee stock awards; this will lead to substantial additional compensation expense. This change will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. Note 2 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements in this report provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value-based method similar to the methods required under
SFAS 123R to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance, which
could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Because our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock market, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and
self-regulated organizations, including the SEC, Nasdaq and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which monitors the accounting practices of public companies. Many of these
regulations have only recently been enacted, and continue to evolve, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and
are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

In
particular, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting
and auditor attestation of that assessment in our annual report for our fiscal year ending October 31, 2005. This effort has required, and continues to require, the commitment of significant
financial and managerial resources. Although we believe that our ongoing review of our internal controls will enable us to provide a favorable assessment of our internal controls and for our external
auditors to provide their attestation as of October 31, 2005 as required by Section 404, we can give no assurance that these efforts will be completed on a timely and successful basis.
Any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain our auditors' attestation could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.

Product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation.

Despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new
versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. Product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development
or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. In addition, allegations of IC manufacturability issues resulting
from use of our IP products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license IP products from us. Any such errors or delays in releasing new products or
new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our
resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

An unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our effective tax rates could adversely affect our operating results.

Our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Our tax filings are subject to review or
audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our
business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, we are undergoing an audit


of
our United States federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in the
audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, there
could be a material adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

Computer viruses, intrusion attempts on our information technology infrastructure and "denial of service" attacks could seriously disrupt our business operations.

"Hackers" and others have in the past created a number of computer viruses or otherwise initiated "denial of service" attacks on computer networks and systems.
Our information technology
infrastructure is regularly subject to various attacks and intrusion efforts of differing seriousness and sophistication. While we diligently maintain our information technology infrastructure and
continuously implement protections against such viruses or intrusions, if our defensive measures fail or should similar defensive measures by our customers fail, our business could be materially and
adversely affected.

If export controls affecting our products are expanded, our business will be adversely affected.

The U.S. Department of Commerce regulates the sale and shipment of certain technologies by U.S. companies to foreign countries. To date, we believe we have
successfully complied with applicable export regulations. However, if the Department of Commerce places significant export controls on our existing, future or acquired products, our business would be
materially and adversely affected.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term
investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve
this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our
investment policy. None of our investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument.

The

In April 2004, we entered into a three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility contains financial
covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified
levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on April 28, 2007. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative
agent's prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between 0.80% and 1.125% based on
a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.20% and 0.25% per annum based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant.
In April, 2004, we borrowed and repaid $200 million under the credit facility. As of October 31, 2004, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and we were in
compliance with all covenants.

Foreign Currency Risk.

The functional currency of each of Synopsys' foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local
currency, except for our principal Irish subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. We engage in a program to hedge (i) those currency exposures associated with certain assets and
liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, (ii) forecasted accounts receivable, backlog and accounts payable denominated in non-functional currencies and
(iii) the translation effect of our operating expenses denominated in Euro. Our hedging activities are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on the value of these balances and
expenses. The success of these activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates. Looking forward, to the extent our estimates of various balances denominated in non-functional
currencies prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. We can provide no assurance that our hedging
transactions will be effective.

Foreign
currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We have
limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk. Furthermore, we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution. We do not enter into forward
contracts for speculative purposes.

The
following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2004. Due to the short-term nature of these contracts, the contract
rates approximate the weighted-


average
currency exchange rates as of October 31, 2004. These forward contracts are rolled forward on a monthly basis to match firmly committed transactions.

In
fiscal 2005, we began hedging forecasted Euro expenses for periods of up to one year. The gains or losses from these forward contracts will be recorded in other comprehensive income
until the forecasted transactions occur.

Net
unrealized gains of approximately $9.6 million and $19.3 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet as
of October 31, 2004 and
October 31, 2003, respectively. Net cash outflows on maturing forward contracts during the three months ended October 31, 2004 were $0.8 million.

Equity Risk.

Our strategic investment portfolio consists of approximately $12.8 million of minority equity investments
in publicly traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately $8.6 million as of October 31, 2003. The securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as
available-for-sale securities accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities,

and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders'
equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value.


Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Synopsys, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2004. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement

SYNOPSYS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Description of Business

Synopsys, Inc. (the Company) is a provider of electronic design automation (EDA) software for semiconductor design. The Company delivers technology-leading
semiconductor design and verification platforms to global electronics companies enabling development of complex systems-on-chips (SoCs). Synopsys also provides intellectual
property and design services to simplify the design process and to accelerate time to market for its customers.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year End.

The Company has a fiscal year that ends on the Saturday nearest October 31. All fiscal years
presented were 52-week years. Fiscal 2005 will also be a 52-week year. For presentation purposes, the consolidated financial statements and notes refer to the calendar month
end.

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Stock Split.

On September 23, 2003, the Company completed a two-for-one stock split in the
form of a stock dividend. All common share and per share data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The functional currency of each of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the foreign
subsidiary's local currency except for the Company's principal Irish subsidiary, whose functional currency is the United States (U.S.) dollar. Non-functional currency monetary balances are
remeasured into the functional currency of the subsidiary with any related gain or loss recorded in earnings. The Company translates assets and liabilities of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars
at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The Company translates income and expense items of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period. Accumulated
net translation adjustments are reported in stockholders' equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Use of Estimates.

To prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management
must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments.

The fair value of the Company's cash, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, long-term investments, forward contracts relating to certain investments in equity securities, accounts payable, long-term debt and foreign currency contracts,
approximates the carrying amount, which is the amount for which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.

The Company classifies investments with original maturities of three
months or less when acquired as cash equivalents. All of the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The cost of securities sold is based on
the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. The Company has cash equivalents and investments with various high quality institutions
and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution.


Concentration of Credit Risk.

The Company sells its products worldwide primarily to customers in the global electronics
market. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company establishes reserves for potential
credit losses and such losses have been within management's expectations and have not been material in any year presented.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

The Company establishes reserves for potential credit losses including a specific reserve
for any particular receivable when collectibility is not probable. In addition, the Company provides a general reserve on all accounts receivable based on a specified range of percentages of the
outstanding balance in each aged group. Such losses have been within management's expectations and have not been material in any year presented. The following table provides a rollforward of the
changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Accounts
written off, net of recoveries

Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Assets are depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the

Software Development Costs.

Capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility, which is generally the completion of a working prototype and ends upon general release of the product. Software development costs capitalized were $2.7 million, $2.6 million
and $1.6 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Amortization of software development costs is computed based on the straight-line method over the software's estimated
economic life of approximately two years. The Company recorded amortization of $2.3 million, $1.6 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by the Company. The goodwill recorded as a result of the business combinations in the years presented is not deductible for tax purposes.

Intangible
assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer installed base/relationship, trademarks and tradenames, covenants not to compete, customer
backlog, capitalized software and other intangibles. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from three to ten years.
Amortization of intangible assets was $136.4 million, $124.8 million and $62.2 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal
2002 includes amortization of goodwill of $16.2 million.

In
fiscal 2002, the Company recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $3.8 million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions to their
estimated fair value. Approximately $3.7 million and $0.1 million are included in integration expense and amortization of intangible assets, respectively, on the statement of operations
for fiscal 2002. The impairment charge is primarily attributable to the Route Compiler technology acquired from and goodwill related to the acquisition of Stanza, Inc. (Stanza) in 1999. The
Company determined that it would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology as products acquired in the acquisition of Avant! Corporation (Avant!) provide
customers with similar capabilities as well as additional functionality. As a result, the Company does not anticipate future sales of the Stanza product.

Deferred Compensation Plan.

The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan (the Plan) which permits certain employees to
defer up to 50% of their annual cash base compensation or 100% of their annual cash variable compensation. Distributions from the Plan are generally payable upon cessation of employment over five to
15 years or as a lump sum payment at the option of the employee. Undistributed amounts under the Plan are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. As of October 31, 2004 and
2003, the invested amounts under the Plan total $41.8 million and $31.3 million, respectively, and are recorded as a long-term asset on the Company's balance sheet. As of
October 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company has recorded $44.2 million and $32.5 million, respectively, as a long-term liability to recognize undistributed amounts due to
employees.

Other Comprehensive Income.

The Company records comprehensive income in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income

, which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its
components in the financial statements. Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources, such as accumulated net translation
adjustments, unrealized gains on certain foreign currency forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges and reclassification adjustments related to unrealized gains on investments.
Reclassification adjustments decrease other comprehensive income for gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities realized during the current year and are included in
other comprehensive income as unrealized holding gains in the period in which such unrealized gains arose.

Accumulated
other comprehensive income consists of the following:

Revenue Recognition.

Synopsys has designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with Statement of
Position (SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, as amended by SOP 98-9,

Modification of SOP
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.

With
respect to software sales, Synopsys utilizes three license types:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

are for a finite term, on average approximately three years, and generally provide
the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Post-contract customer support (maintenance or PCS) is
bundled for the term of the license and not charged for separately.

•

Term licenses

are also for a finite term, usually two to three years, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive,
or to exchange licensed software for unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual
maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

•

Perpetual licenses

continue as long as the customer renews maintenance, plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual
licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may
renew annually. The annual maintenance fee for purchases under $2 million is typically calculated as a percentage of the list price of the licensed software. For purchases over
$2 million, the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee and are sometimes referred to as "variable maintenance perpetuals."

The
Company sometimes refers to TSLs and term licenses, either individually or collectively, as "renewable licenses" because the customer must purchase an extension or a new license in
order to continue using the software after the specified term of the contract expires. In a renewal transaction,
the Company may either replace the pre-existing arrangement with an entirely new agreement or maintain two overlapping agreements. Where the Company replaces the existing agreement, the
original agreement is often superseded and thereafter the Company delivers software and recognizes revenue based upon the type of license reflected in the new agreement. Where the Company maintains
two agreements, revenue recognition on the new incremental agreement is based on the license type purchased. If extended payment terms are granted (as discussed below), license revenue will be
recognized as payments become due and payable.

Customers
occasionally convert their existing TSLs to perpetual licenses, paying an incremental fee which the Company recognizes upon contract signing in accordance with AICPA Technical
Practice Aid (TPA) 5100.73, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In some situations, the contract converting the TSL to a perpetual license is modified to such an extent that
a new arrangement exists. The changes to the contract may include increases or decreases in the total technology under license, changes in payment terms, changes in license terms and other pertinent
factors. In these situations, the Company accounts for all of the arrangement fee as a new sale and recognizes revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Synopsys has a policy
that defines the specific circumstances under which it accounts for these transactions as a new perpetual license sale.

The
Company reports revenue in three categories: upfront license, time-based license and service.


Upfront
license revenue includes:

•

Perpetual Licenses

. The Company recognizes the perpetual license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment terms
require the customer to pay at least 75% of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of
the license fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable.

•

Upfront Term Licenses

. The Company recognizes the term license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment terms
require the customer to pay at least 75% of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

Time-based
license revenue includes:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses

. The Company typically recognizes revenue from TSL license fees (which include bundled
maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period. However, where extended payment terms (i.e. where less than 75% of the TSL license fees are due within one year from shipment) are offered
under the license arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue from TSL license fees in an amount equal to the lesser of the ratable portion of the entire fee or customer installments as they become
due and payable.

•

Term Licenses with Extended Payment Terms

. For term licenses where less than 75% of the term license fee is due within one
year from shipment, the Company recognizes revenue as customer installments become due and payable.

Service
revenue includes:

•

Maintenance Fees Associated with Perpetual and Term Licenses

. The Company generally recognizes revenue from maintenance
associated with perpetual and term licenses ratably over the maintenance term.

•

Professional Service Fees

. The Company generally recognizes revenue from consulting and training services as services are
performed.

The
Company allocates revenue on software transactions (referred to as "arrangements") involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements. The
Company's determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). The Company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element
to the price charged when the same element is sold separately.

The
Company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple-element arrangements and determined that it has sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of
its perpetual and term license products and to consulting. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue from perpetual and term licenses is recognized upon delivery
using the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9, revenue from maintenance is
recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue from consulting is recognized as the related services are delivered.

The
Company makes significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving its products, the Company must evaluate whether:


(i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) its fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is probable. The Company
applies these criteria as discussed below.

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists

. The Company's customary practice is to have a written contract, signed by both
the customer and the Company, or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement prior to
recognizing revenue on an arrangement.

•

Delivery Has Occurred

. The Company delivers software to its customers physically or electronically. For physical deliveries,
the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when the Company provides the customer access codes, or "keys," that allow the customer to take
immediate possession of the software on its hardware.

•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable

. The Company's determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends
principally on the arrangement's payment terms. The Company's standard payment terms require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year. Where these terms apply, the Company regards
the fee as fixed or determinable, and the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the payment terms do not meet this standard, which is
refered to as "extended payment terms," the Company does not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognizes revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case
of a TSL, the Company recognizes revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable, due to application of other revenue accounting guidelines relating to maintenance services and arrangements
that include rights to unspecified future technology.

•

Collectibility is Probable

. To recognize revenue, the Company must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees, which it
does on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to its credit review policy. The Company typically sells to customers with whom it has a history of successful collection. For a
new customer, the Company evaluates the customer's financial position and ability to pay and typically assigns a credit limit based on that review. The Company
increases the credit limit only after it has established a successful collection history with the customer. If the Company determines at any time that collectibility is not probable based upon its
credit review process or the customer's payment history, the Company recognizes revenue on a cash-collected basis.

Earnings Per Share.

The Company computes basic earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. The Company computes diluted earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive stock options outstanding during the period; the number
of weighted-average dilutive stock options outstanding is computed using the treasury stock method. Due to the net loss incurred for fiscal 2002, the effect of employee stock options is
anti-dilutive in that period.


The
table below reconciles the weighted-average common shares used to calculate basic net income per share with the weighted-average common shares used to calculate diluted net income
per share.

respectively, which were anti-dilutive for net income per share calculations.

Stock-Based Compensation.

As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, the Company has elected to use the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 (APB 25),

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to employees. Accordingly, the
Company generally recognizes no compensation expense with respect to stock-based awards to employees as awards are issued with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the common stock on the grant
date. The Company has determined pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share as if the Company had accounted for employee stock awards under the fair value method as required by
SFAS No. 123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
and Disclosure

. The fair value of these stock-based awards to employees was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and using the
following weighted-average assumptions:

six-month purchase period. The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options issued during fiscal 2004,


and 2002 was $11.79, $13.06 and $12.87 per share, respectively. The weighted-average estimated fair value of share purchase rights granted under the ESPP during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$11.32, $6.16 and $7.49 per share, respectively. The Company's pro forma net income and earnings per share data under SFAS No. 123 is as follows:

Foreign Currency Contracts.

The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency
exchange rates. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted
transactions and balance sheet positions. These foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value, have a duration of approximately 30 days and are denominated primarily in the Euro and the
Japanese yen. As of October 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company had $65.6 million, $143.1 million and $305.1 million, respectively, of short-term foreign
currency forward contracts outstanding. The fair value of these contracts was not significant as of October 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.

The
components of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as cash flow hedges, with gains and losses recorded in stockholders'
equity and reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted transactions occur. As of October 31, 2004, an unrealized gain of approximately $9.6 million is recorded in stockholders'
equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for
forecasted transactions is approximately three years.

Hedging
effectiveness is evaluated monthly using spot rates, with any gain or loss caused by hedging ineffectiveness reclassified to earnings as other income (expense). The
premium/discount component of the forward contracts is amortized to other income (expense) and is not included in evaluating hedging effectiveness.


The
earnings impact of gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts, net of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, was immaterial for the fiscal years ended
October 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.

Effective
May 4, 2003, the Company changed the functional reporting currency of its principal Irish subsidiary to the U.S. dollar from the Euro because an increasing percentage of
its sales in Europe and Asia, and the resulting accounts receivable, are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Warranties.

Synopsys typically warrants its products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to
material specification for a period of 90 days. The Company also indemnifies its customers from third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to the use of our products and
is currently defending some of its customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes a patent held by Japanese electronics company. Historically, costs related to these
guarantees have not been significant but the Company is unable to estimate the potential impact of these guarantees on the future results of operations.

Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R) which will be effective in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005. SFAS 123R will result in the recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans. The Company
currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to its employees. Under this standard, the Company generally does not recognize any compensation
related to stock option grants the Company issues under its stock option plans or related to the discounts the Company provides under its employee stock purchase plans. Under the new rules, the
Company is required to adopt a fair-value-based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards; this will lead to substantial additional compensation
expense and therefore will have a material adverse effect on the Company's reported results of operations. The paragraph entitled

Stock Based
Compensation

above provides the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the Company had used a fair-value-based method similar to the methods required
under SFAS 123R to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.


Note 3. Business Combinations and Divestitures

Purchase Combinations.

During the fiscal years presented, the Company made a number of purchase acquisitions. For each
acquisition, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated value of the net tangible assets acquired was allocated to various intangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technology,
customer- and contract-related assets, other intangible assets and goodwill. The values assigned to developed technologies related to each acquisition were based upon future discounted cash flows
related to the existing products' projected income streams. The amounts allocated to purchased in-process research and development were determined through established valuation techniques
in the high-technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed.

Pro
forma results of operations are presented only for material acquisitions. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of
acquisition.

Fiscal 2004 Acquisitions

In February 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of Accelerant Networks, Inc. (Accelerant) for total consideration of $23.8 million
and the acquisition of the technology assets of Analog Design Automation, Inc. (ADA) for total consideration of $12.2 million. In October 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of Cascade Semiconductors, Inc. (Cascade) for total upfront consideration of $15.8 million and contingent consideration of up to $10.0 million to be paid upon the
achievement of certain performance milestones over the three years following the acquisition. The Company acquired Accelerant in order to enhance Synopsys' standards-based IP solutions. The Company
acquired ADA in order to enhance the Company's analog and mixed signal offerings. The Company acquired Cascade, an IP provider, in order to augment Synopsys' offerings of PCI Express products.
Included in the total consideration of these acquisitions are aggregate acquisition costs of $4.3 million, consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees and other directly related charges.

In
fiscal 2004, the Company completed one additional acquisition and two additional asset acquisition transactions for aggregate consideration of $12.3 million in upfront payments
and acquisition-related costs and contingent consideration of up to $5 million to be paid based on the achievement of certain milestones. The Company does not consider these acquisition
transactions to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's balance sheet or results of operations.

The
results of operations of the acquisitions and the impact on operations of the acquisition of assets transactions are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations from the date of each respective transaction through October 31, 2004.

The
Company allocated the total aggregate purchase consideration for these transactions to the assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their
respective fair values at the acquisition dates, resulting in aggregate goodwill of $24.5 million. Aggregate identifiable intangible assets as a result of these acquisitions, consisting
primarily of purchased technology and other intangibles, are $44.8 million, and are being amortized over three to five years. Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase consideration
over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions, will not be amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company included the amortization of
purchased technology in cost of revenue in its statements of operations for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2004.


Fiscal 2003 Acquisitions

Numerical Technologies, Inc. (Numerical).

On March 1, 2003, the Company completed
its acquisition of Numerical. The Company acquired Numerical in order to combine Numerical's subwavelength, lithography-enabling solutions with the Company's leading integrated circuit (IC) design
solutions and thereby reduce costs and manufacturing risk for the Company's customers.

Purchase Price.

The Company paid Numerical common stockholders $7.00 in cash in exchange for each share of Numerical common
stock owned as of the merger date, or approximately $240.2 million. The total purchase consideration consisted of:

Unaudited Pro Forma Results of Operations.

The following table presents pro forma results of operations and gives effect to
the Numerical acquisition as if the acquisition was consummated at the beginning of fiscal 2002. The Company has not included the effect of its other fiscal 2003 acquisitions in the pro forma results
of operations because the effects of these acquisitions were not material. The Company's results of operations may have been different than those shown below if the Company had


actually
acquired Numerical at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Pro forma results below do not necessarily indicate future operating results.

2002 pro forma results of operations and fiscal 2003 pro forma results of operations for the period from November 1, 2002 through February 28, 2003 include
Numerical's reported revenue in the periods Numerical recognized such revenues. However, the purchase method of accounting requires Synopsys to reduce Numerical's reported deferred revenue to an
amount equal to the fair value of the legal liability, resulting in lower revenue in periods following the merger than Numerical would have achieved as a separate company. Therefore, revenues from
Numerical products for the period from March 1, 2003 to October 31, 2003 included in the pro forma results of operations reflect the lower amortization of deferred revenue stemming from
this purchase accounting adjustment.

Other Fiscal 2003 Acquisitions.

During fiscal 2003, the Company completed two additional
acquisitions for aggregate consideration consisting of $8.8 million in upfront payments and acquisition expenses and contingent consideration totaling $3.5 million based on the
achievement of certain milestones as outlined in the acquisition agreements. In-process research and development expenses associated with these acquisitions totaled $1.6 million for
fiscal 2003. These acquisitions are not considered material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's balance sheet and results of operations.

Fiscal 2002 Acquisitions

Avant! Corporation.

On June 6, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of Avant!. The
Company acquired Avant! in order to offer its customers a complete end-to-end solution for system-on-chip design that combines the Company's logic
synthesis and design verification tools with Avant!'s advanced place and route, physical verification and design integrity products, thus increasing customers' design efficiencies.


Purchase Price.

Holders of Avant! common stock received 0.371 of a share of the Company's common stock (including the
associated preferred stock rights) in exchange for each share of Avant! common stock owned as of the closing date, aggregating 14.5 million shares of the Company's common stock. The fair value
of the the Company's shares issued was based on a per share value of $54.74, which was equal to the Company's average last sale price per share as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the
trading-day period two days before and after December 3, 2001, the date of the merger agreement.

The
total purchase consideration consisted of the following:

As of October 31, 2004, $117.5 million of costs have been paid. The remaining acquisition-related costs consist primarily of legal
and other professional services fees related to the liquidation of certain of the legal entities acquired in the merger.

Facilities
closure costs at the closing date include $54.2 million related to Avant!'s corporate headquarters. After the merger, the Company consolidated the functions performed
in the buildings into its corporate facilities. The lessors brought a claim against Avant! for the future amounts payable under the lease agreements. The amount accrued at the closing date was equal
to the future amounts payable under the related lease agreements, without taking into consideration in the accrual any defenses the Company may have had to the claim. The Company settled the claims of
one of the two landlords of these buildings during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 for $7.4 million, and settled the claims of the other landlord during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for
$15.0 million. Resolving these contingencies reduced the amount allocated to liabilities and goodwill by $31.6 million.

Employee
severance costs include (i) $39.6 million in cash paid to Avant!'s Chairman of the Board, consisting of severance plus a cash payment equal to the intrinsic value
of his in-the-money stock options at the closing date in accordance with his pre-merger employment agreement, (ii) $5.1 million


in
cash severance payments paid to redundant employees (primarily sales and corporate infrastructure personnel) terminated on or subsequent to the consummation of the merger under an approved plan of
termination and (iii) $6.3 million in termination payments to certain executives in accordance with their respective pre-merger employment agreements. The total number of
Avant! employees terminated as a result of the merger was approximately 250.

Other
acquisition-related costs of $37.4 million consist primarily of banking, legal and accounting fees, printing costs and other directly related charges including contract
termination costs of $6.3 million.

The
initial allocation of the purchase price included certain assets and liabilities recorded using preliminary estimates of fair value. During fiscal 2002, the value assigned to
Avant!'s investment in a venture capital fund was reduced from the preliminary value of $12.8 million to $5.0 million as a result of obtaining additional information on the venture
fund's non-public investments and the Company's


subsequent
sale of the investment to a third party. The decrease in the fair value of the investment increased the consideration allocated to goodwill by $7.8 million. During fiscal 2002, the
Company also increased the value of the acquired customs and use-tax liabilities by $2.5 million, resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill.

During
fiscal 2004, the Company also performed a revaluation of acquired deferred tax assets resulting in a decrease of $17.4 million in deferred tax assets. The revaluation was
based on review of pre-acquisition tax returns.

Asset Held for Sale.

As a result of the merger, the Company acquired Avant!'s physical libraries business and the Company was
obligated to offer and sell such business to Artisan Components, Inc. (Artisan) under the terms of a January 2001 non-compete agreement, under which Synopsys agreed not to
engage, directly or indirectly, in the physical libraries business before January 3, 2003. As of the closing date, the value allocated to the acquired libraries business had been recorded as
net assets held for sale, based on the estimated future net cash flows from the libraries business in accordance with EITF 87-11,

Allocation of Purchase Price to
Assets to Be Sold.

During fiscal 2002, management determined that the libraries business would not be sold and, accordingly, allocated the fair value of the libraries business
as of the closing date to the underlying tangible assets and intangible assets. The fair value allocated to the tangible and intangible assets was $8.3 million, with the remaining fair value
allocated to goodwill.

Contract Rights Intangible.

Avant! had executed signed license agreements and delivered the initial configuration of licensed
technologies under ratable license arrangements, and had executed signed contracts to provide maintenance over a one- to three-year period, for which Avant! did not consider
the fees to be fixed and determinable at the outset of the arrangement. There were no receivables or deferred revenues recorded on Avant!'s historical financial statements at the closing date as the
related payments were not yet due under extended payment terms and deliveries were scheduled to occur over the terms of the arrangements. These ratable licenses and maintenance arrangements required
future performance by both parties and, as such, represented executory contracts. The contract rights intangible asset associated with these arrangements is being amortized to cost of revenue over the
related contract lives of three years.

The
amortization of intangible assets, with the exception of the contract rights intangible and core/developed technology, is included in operating expenses in the statement of
operations for fiscal 2003 and 2002. Amortization of core/developed technology and contract rights intangible is included in cost of revenue.

Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (Cadence) Litigation.

At the time of the acquisition of Avant!, Avant! was engaged in
civil litigation with Cadence regarding alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, among other things, by Avant! and certain individuals.

In
connection with the merger, the Company entered into a policy with a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. whereby insurance was obtained for certain compensatory,
exemplary and punitive damages, penalties and fines and attorneys' fees arising out of pending litigation between Avant! and Cadence. The policy did not provide coverage for litigation other than the
Avant!/Cadence litigation.


The
Company paid a total premium of $335.8 million for the policy, of which $240.8 million was contingently refundable. The balance of the premium paid to the insurer of
$95.0 million was included in integration expense for fiscal 2002. Under the policy, the insurer was obligated to pay covered loss up to a limit of liability equaling
(i) $500.0 million plus (ii) interest accruing at the fixed rate of 2%, compounded semi-annually, on $250.0 million (the interest component), as reduced by
previous covered losses. Interest earned on $250.0 million was included in other income, net in the post-merger consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2002.

On
November 13, 2002, Cadence and the Company reached a settlement of the litigation. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid Cadence $265.0 million in two
installments—$20.0 million on November 22, 2002 and $245.0 million on December 16, 2002. In addition, Cadence and the Company have entered into reciprocal
license arrangements covering the
intellectual property at issue in the litigation. As a result of the payment, the Company has recognized expense of approximately $240.8 million, which equals the contingently refundable
portion of the insurance premium plus interest accrued on the refundable portion. This expense is included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal 2002.

Co-Design Automation, Inc. (Co-Design).

On September 6,
2002, the Company acquired Co-Design. The Company acquired Co-Design in order to help promote the development and adoption of the Superlog hardware design language, combine
Co-Design's technology with the Company's high-level verification and design implementation tools and give the Company access to Co-Design's highly-skilled
employees.

Holders
of Co-Design common stock received consideration consisting of cash and notes totaling $32.7 million in exchange for all shares of Co-Design common
stock owned as of the merger date. The total purchase consideration consisted of the following:

services performed in fiscal 2002 and the remainder was an element of the purchase price. An aggregate of $4.2 million of these notes will be paid in September 2007. The remaining notes
plus accrued interest were paid in September 2004 when certain milestones were met.

inSilicon Corporation (inSilicon).

On September 20, 2002, the Company completed its
acquisition of inSilicon. The Company acquired inSilicon in order to broaden its offering of standard-based IP products.

Purchase Price.

Holders of inSilicon common stock received $4.05 in exchange for each share of inSilicon common stock owned
as of the merger date, or approximately $65.4 million. The total purchase consideration consisted of the following:

The
amortization of intangible assets is included in cost of revenue in the statement of operations. inSilicon had executed signed contracts with five of its major customers to provide
IP licenses, including significant modifications to the IP license in order to meet unique customer requirements. The value associated with these contracts was determined by quantifying the projected
cash flow related to these contracts, discounted to present value, and is recorded as customer backlog in intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Unaudited Pro Forma Results of Operations.

The following table presents pro forma results of operations and gives effect to
the Avant! and inSilicon acquisitions as if the acquisitions were consummated at the beginning of fiscal 2002. The Company has not included the effect of its other fiscal 2002 acquisitions because the
effects of these acquisitions were not material. The Company's results of operations may have been different than those shown below if the Company had actually


acquired
Avant! and inSilicon at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Pro forma results below do not necessarily indicate future operating results.

Fiscal
2002 pro forma results of operations for the period from November 1, 2002 to the respective dates of acquisition include Avant! and inSilicon's reported revenue in the
periods Avant! and inSilicon recognized such revenues. However, the purchase method of accounting requires Synopsys to reduce Avant! and inSilicon's reported deferred revenue to an amount equal to the
fair value of the legal liability, resulting in lower revenue in periods following the merger than Avant! and inSilicon would have achieved as separate companies. Therefore, revenues from Avant! and
inSilicon products for the period from the date of acquisition to October 31, 2002 included in the pro forma results of operations reflect the lower amortization of deferred revenue stemming
from this purchase accounting adjustment.

Net
income for fiscal 2002 includes non-recurring acquisition costs incurred by Synopsys of $335.8 million for the Avant! insurance policy premium,
$82.5 million for IPRD resulting from the Avant! merger, $5.2 million for IPRD resulting from the inSilicon merger. Net income for fiscal 2002 also includes non-recurring
costs incurred by Avant! of $21.0 and $268.1 million, respectively, for certain litigation settlement costs paid by Avant! prior to the merger.

Integration Costs.

Non-recurring integration costs incurred relate to merger activities which are not included in
the purchase consideration under Emerging Issues Task Force Number 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business
Combination

. These costs are expensed as incurred. During fiscal 2002, integration costs totaled $128.5 million. These costs consisted primarily of
(i) $95.0 million related to the premium for the insurance policy acquired in conjunction with the Avant! merger, (ii) $14.7 million related to write-downs of Company
facilities and property under the approved facility exit plan for the Avant! merger, (iii) $10.0 million and $0.7 million related to severance costs for Company employees who were
terminated and costs associated with transition employees as a result of the Avant! and inSilicon mergers, respectively, (iv) $1.3 million related to the write-off of
software licenses owned by the Company which were originally purchased from Avant!, (v) $3.7 million goodwill impairment charge related to a prior Company acquisition as a result of the
acquisition of Avant!, and (vi) $1.2 million and $1.9 million of other expenses including travel and certain professional fees for the Avant! and Co-Design mergers,
respectively.

As
of October 31, 2004, the stated maturities of the Company's current investments (including $15.9 million classified as cash equivalent investments in the
table above) are $99.9 million within one year, $93.1 million within one to five years, $10.3 million within five to ten years and $44.9 million after


ten
years. These investments are generally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported
as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Realized gains and losses on sales of short-term investments have not been material in any period presented.

Strategic Investments.

The Company's strategic investment portfolio consists of minority equity investments in publicly
traded companies and investments in privately held companies. The securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as available-for-sale securities accounted
for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115),

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. The cost
basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. These securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. As of October 31, 2004,
the carrying value of our strategic investments was $12.8 million.

During
the years ended October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 the Company determined that certain strategic investments, with an aggregate value of $3.5 million,
$7.1 million and $16.3 million, respectively, were impaired and that the impairment was permanent. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of
approximately $3.0 million, $4.5 million and $11.3 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to write down the carrying value of the investments.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

Available-for-sale equity investments accounted for under
SFAS 115 are subject to market price risk. From time to time, the Company enters into and designates forward contracts to hedge variable cash flows from anticipated sales of these investments.
The Company has not entered into any such contracts after fiscal 2002. In accounting for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the
derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged anticipated transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in the
fair value of the derivative is recognized in earnings immediately.

Prior
to fiscal 2002, the Company entered into forward sale contracts with a major financial institution for the sale of certain of the Company's strategic investments. During fiscal
2002 and 2003, the Company physically settled the forward contracts. The net gain on the forward contracts was offset by the net loss on the related available-for-sale
investment since inception of the hedge, with any gain or loss reclassified from other comprehensive income to other income. No forward contracts were entered into in any period presented and none of
the prior contracts remain outstanding.

Debt.

As of October 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's debt totaled $7.4 million and $7.2 million,
respectively, and consisted primarily of notes related to acquisitions payable through 2007 and notes to secure bonds related to certain property taxes.

In
April 2004, Synopsys entered into a three-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility contains financial covenants
requiring that the Company maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on April 28, 2007.
Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent's prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, the Company has the option to pay interest based on
the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between 0.80% and 1.125% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment fees


are
payable on the facility at rates between 0.20% and 0.25% per annum based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In April 2004, the Company borrowed and repaid $200.0 million
under the credit facility. As of October 31, 2004, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants.

Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company leases certain of its domestic and foreign facilities and certain office equipment under operating leases. Rent expense was $36.3 million,
$35.1 million and $33.7 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In October 2003, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a portion of its office space by which
it leases a building owned by it in Sunnyvale, California to a third party through February 2009. The Company has received monthly sublease payments of $150,000 since March 2004.

Future
minimum lease payments on all facility operating leases, net of sublease income, as of October 31, 2004 are as follows:

On
August 25, 2004, a class action complaint entitled Kanekal v. Synopsys, Inc., et al., No. C-04-3580, was filed in federal district court
for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its officers alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint purports to be a class action lawsuit
brought on behalf of persons who acquired Company stock during the period of December 3, 2003 through August 18, 2004. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants caused the
Company to make false and misleading statements about the Company's business, forecasts, and financial performance, and that certain Company officers or employees sold portions of their stock holdings
while in the possession of adverse, non-public information. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought. In November 2004, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff in
the case. As a result, the Company expects the plaintiff to file an amended complaint in January 2005. Discovery has not commenced in the case and no trial date has been established. While
management intends to defend against these federal securities claims vigorously, and the Company does not believe that this lawsuit will have a material effect on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of this lawsuit. As of October 31, 2004, no amount is accrued as a loss is not considered probable
or estimable.


Note 7. Stockholders' Equity

Stock Repurchase Programs.

In July 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under
which Synopsys common stock with a market value up to $500 million may be acquired in the open market. This stock repurchase program replaced all prior repurchase programs authorized by the
Board. The Company uses all common shares repurchased for ongoing stock issuances such as existing employee stock option plans, existing stock purchase plans and acquisitions. The July 2001
stock repurchase program has been renewed by the Company's Board of Directors annually through December 2004. In each renewal the Board of Directors replenished the amount of the program up to
$500 million. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company purchased approximately 16.9 million shares at an average price of $25.02 per share, approximately 9.4 million
shares at an average price of $27.72 per share, and approximately 7.8 million shares at an average price of $22.10 per share, respectively.

Preferred Shares Rights Plan.

The Company has adopted a number of provisions that could have anti-takeover
effects, including a Preferred Shares Rights Plan. In addition, the Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by its stockholders, to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares
of authorized but undesignated shares of Preferred Stock. This provision and other provisions of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law
may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company, including transactions in which the stockholders of the Company might
otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. The preferred share rights expire on October 24, 2007.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan and International Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(collectively, the ESPP) an aggregate of 17,700,000 shares have been authorized for issuance as of October 31, 2004. Under the ESPP, employees are granted the right to purchase shares of common
stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at (i) the beginning of a rolling two-year offering period or (ii) the end of each
semi-annual purchase period, subject to a plan limit on the number of shares that may be purchased in a purchase period. During fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 shares totaling 1,898,402,
1,536,574 and 1,255,882, respectively, were issued under the plan at average per share prices of $15.51, $17.35 and $16.93, respectively. As of October 31, 2004, 5,935,590 shares of common
stock were reserved for future issuance under the plan. We intend to seek stockholder approval of an increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP at our 2005 annual meeting of
stockholders.

Stock Option Plans.

Under the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan (the 1992 Plan), 38,951,016 shares of common stock have been
authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1992 Plan, the Board of Directors (the Board) may grant either incentive or non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock to
employees and consultants, excluding non-employee directors at not less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1992 Plan
generally vest over a period of four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of October 31, 2004, 8,284,470 stock options remain outstanding and 7,128,810 shares of common stock
are reserved for future grants under this plan.

Under
the Company's 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan), 53,247,068 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1998 Plan, the
Board may grant non-qualified stock options to employees and consultants, excluding executive officers. Exercisability, option price and other terms are determined by the Board but the
option price shall not be less than


100%
of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1998 Plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire seven to ten years from the date of
grant. As of October 31, 2004, 26,150,004 stock options remain outstanding and 5,460,416 shares of common stock were reserved for future grants under this plan.

Under
the Company's 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan), 2,100,000 shares were authorized for issuance. The Directors Plan provided for
automatic grants to each non-employee member of the Board upon initial appointment or election to the Board, upon reelection and for annual service on Board committees. The option price
was not less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Under the Directors Plan, as originally adopted, new directors received an option for 40,000 shares, vesting in equal
installments over four years. In addition, each continuing director who was elected at an annual meeting of stockholders received an option for 20,000 shares and an additional option for 10,000 shares
for each Board committee membership, up to a maximum of two committee service grants per year. In August 2003, the Board amended the Directors Plan in order to reduce the size of the initial
and committee grants to 30,000 and 5,000 shares, respectively. The annual and committee service option grants vest in full on the date immediately prior to the date of the annual meeting following
their grant, assuming continued board or committee service through such date. In the case of directors appointed to the Board between annual meetings, the annual and any committee grants were prorated
based upon the amount of time since the last annual meeting. The Directors Plan terminated as to future grants in October 2004; however, as of October 31, 2004, 1,297,660 stock options
remain outstanding. With the expiration of the Directors Plan, we expect to seek stockholder approval of a new plan for non-employee directors at our 2005 annual meeting of stockholders.

We
have assumed certain option plans in connection with business combinations. Generally, the options granted under these plans have terms similar to our own options. The exercise prices
of such options have been adjusted to reflect the relative exchange ratios. We do not intend to make future grants out of these option plans.

Note 8. Income Taxes

The Company is entitled to a deduction for federal and state tax purposes with respect to employees' stock option activity. The net reduction in taxes otherwise
payable arising from that deduction has been credited to additional paid-in capital.

As
of October 31, 2004, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred
tax assets.

The
Company's U.S. income tax returns for fiscal 2000 and 2001 are under examination. Management believes that adequate amounts have been provided for any adjustments that may ultimately
result from this examination.

The
Company has federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately $191.2 million as of October 31, 2004 which includes a federal loss carryforward of approximately
$16.8 million resulting from tax deductions in 2003 and 2004 related to employee stock options. The loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2024. Beginning in fiscal 2004, the Company
classified all tax loss carryforwards, federal


foreign
tax credits and federal and California research and development credits as non-current because the prospect of utilization in the relevant jurisdiction is not expected in the next
twelve months. Because of the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of the Company's loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations. The annual limitation may
result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization. Management believes that all net operating losses will be utilized, and a valuation allowance is not necessary. The tax benefit
of federal net operating losses attributable to employee stock options is credited directly to stockholders' equity.

The
Company has federal foreign tax credits of $40.7 million. If not utilized, $33.4 million of the foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2008, and
$7.3 million of the foreign tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2014. The Company has federal and California research and development credits of $22.9 million and
$23.4 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development credits will begin to expire in 2023. The Company has other state tax credits of $1.6 million that, if
not utilized, will begin to expire in 2007.

The
Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the U.S. As of October 31, 2004,
the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $36.3 million.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) provides for a special one-time elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a
U.S. taxpayer (Repatriation Provision). The Company has completed its review of the Repatriation Provision and has concluded that it will not benefit from the Act because the Company's overseas
earnings occurred in fiscal years not eligible for repatriation. As a result, the Repatriation Provision did not have any impact on income tax expense during fiscal 2004.

Note 10. Segment Disclosure

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131),

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information

, requires disclosures of certain information regarding operating


segments,
products and services, geographic areas of operation and major customers. SFAS 131 reporting is based upon the "management approach": how management organizes the Company's operating
segments for which separate financial information is (i) available and (ii) evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in deciding how to allocate resources and in
assessing performance. Synopsys' CODMs are the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.

The
Company provides software products and consulting services in the electronic design automation software industry. The Company operates in a single segment. In making operating
decisions, the CODMs primarily consider consolidated financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region. Specifically, the CODMs consider
where individual "seats" or licenses to the Company's products are used in allocating revenue to particular geographic areas. Revenue is defined as revenues from external customers.

revenue data for multi-region, multi-product transactions reflect internal allocations and is therefore subject to certain assumptions and to the Company's methodology.

For
management reporting purposes, we organize our products and services into five distinct groups: Galaxy Design Platform, Discovery Verification Platform, Intellectual Property (IP),
Design for Manufacturing and Professional Services & Other. The following table summarizes the revenue attributable to these groups as a percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years
presented. We include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during a period from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods. For presentation purposes, we allocate
maintenance, which represented approximately 16% of our total revenue and approximately 80% of our total services revenue for fiscal 2004, to the products to which those support services relate.
Further, with the


adoption
of our platform strategy in fiscal 2003, we redefined our product groups and have reclassified prior period revenues in accordance with this new grouping to provide a consistent presentation.

Note 11. Termination of Agreements to Acquire Monolithic System Technology, Inc. and IKOS Systems, Inc.

On February 23, 2004, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Monolithic System Technology, Inc. (MoSys) in a cash and stock
transaction valued at approximately $453 million.

On
April 16, 2004, the Company exercised its right to terminate its merger agreement pursuant to the agreement's termination provisions and paid MoSys a $10.0 million
termination fee. The Company has included the termination fee in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations for fiscal 2004. On April 23, 2004, MoSys filed a complaint in
Delaware Chancery Court against Synopsys and Mountain Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, alleging that the Company improperly exercised its termination right.

On
July 9, 2004, the Company and MoSys announced the settlement of their litigation. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company and MoSys agreed to settle the merger
termination lawsuit filed by MoSys without further liability or payment to one another, and MoSys agreed to dismiss its lawsuit.

On
July 2, 2001, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the IKOS Merger Agreement) with IKOS Systems, Inc. (IKOS). The IKOS Merger
Agreement provided for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of IKOS common stock by the Company.

On
December 7, 2001, Mentor Graphics Corporation (Mentor) commenced a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of IKOS common stock at $11.00 per share, subject
to certain conditions. On March 12, 2002, the Company and IKOS executed a termination agreement by which the parties terminated the IKOS Merger Agreement and pursuant to which IKOS paid the
Company the $5.5 million termination fee required by the IKOS Merger Agreement. This termination fee and $2.4 million of expenses incurred in conjunction with the acquisition are
included in other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2002. The Company subsequently executed a revised termination agreement with Mentor and IKOS in order to add Mentor
as a party thereto.


Note 12. Related Party and Other Transactions

Revenues derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10.8% and 9.5% of fiscal 2004 and 2003 revenues,
respectively. Andy D. Bryant, Intel's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer, also serves on the Company's Board of Directors. Management believes the
transactions between the two parties were carried out on an arm's length basis.

The
Company had a joint venture with Davan Tech Co., Ltd, of Korea (Davan Tech) whereby Davan Tech acted as a non-exclusive distributor for the Company subject to
certain conditions as defined in the distribution agreement. As of October 31, 2003, the Company owned approximately 10% of Davan Tech, and accounted for the investment under the cost basis.
During fiscal 2003 and the period from June 6, 2002 through October 31, 2002, the Company recognized revenues totaling $3.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, from
Davan Tech. Accounts receivable included $0.9 million and $3.7 million of receivable from Davan Tech as of October 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In December 2003, the
Company terminated its distribution agreement with Davan Tech.

The
Company maintains a System-on-a-Chip Venture Fund (the Fund) authorized by the Company's Board of Directors which invests in companies that will
facilitate building SoCs. The Fund is administered by an investment advisory board consisting of senior Company officers, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer,
and Dr. A. Richard Newton, a member of the Company's Board. The Fund has invested an aggregate of approximately $1 million in a private company that develops SoC test systems. At the
times of the investments, SmartForest Ventures, a venture capital firm of which Company director Deborah Coleman formerly served as a general partner, owned in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares
of such company. Ms. Coleman did not participate in any of the Fund's investment decisions.

During
fiscal 2004 and 2003, Dr. Newton, provided consulting services to the Company and was paid $180,000 annually. Under the Company's agreement with Dr. Newton,
Dr. Newton provides advice, at
the Company's request, concerning long-term technology strategy and industry development issues as well as assistance in identifying opportunities for partnerships with academia.

Note 13. Subsequent Events

On November 1, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of ISE Integrated Systems Engineering AG (ISE) for cash consideration of
$95 million, net of cash acquired from ISE. The acquisition will enable the Company to expand its offerings of Technology CAD (TCAD) software products and services, which can reduce the number
of test chips required to optimize and characterize a new semiconductor process, thereby shortening the time and cost to ramp up yield in leading-edge fabs. The Company expects to allocate
the purchase price primarily to in-process research and development, core/developed technology, and/or goodwill.

On
November 30, 2004, the Company signed a merger agreement to acquire Nassda Corporation (Nassda), a provider of circuit simulation products, in an all-cash
transaction for a purchase price of $7.00 per share. The aggregate consideration is approximately $192 million. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing
conditions. In addition, the approval of Nassda's stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Nassda common stock and approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Nassda common stock casting votes affirmatively or negatively on the merger agreement (excluding Nassda's officers and directors, the individual defendants and the related parties of the individual
defendants) is required for Nassda and Synopsys to


complete
the proposed merger. Certain directors, officers and employees of Nassda who own in the aggregate approximately 60% of Nassda's outstanding common shares have agreed to vote in favor of the
adoption and approval of the merger agreement. Upon the closing of the acquisition, the Nassda officers, directors and employees who are defendants in the litigation between the Company and Nassda
will make settlement payments to the Company in the aggregate amount of approximately $61 million.

After
the end of fiscal 2004, and in connection with the Company's December 1, 2004 announcement that the Company signed agreements to acquire Nassda Corporation and to settle all
outstanding litigation between the two companies, a class action complaint entitled Robert Israel v. Nassda Corporation, et. al., No. 4705695, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware naming Nassda, its directors and the Company as defendants and their affiliates. The complaint purports to be a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of shareholders of Nassda, other than
the defendant directors, who allegedly would be injured or threatened with injury if the proposed acquisition of Nassda by the Company proceeded forward on the terms announced. The purported class
action seeks to enjoin the transaction, or alternatively, damages. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought. The Company believes the claims in this purported class action are
without merit, and intends to defend against them vigorously.

On
December 1, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved the replenishment of the Company's stock repurchase plan authorizing $500 million for future repurchases of
the Company's common stock.

In
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Company incurred approximately $13 million more in sales compensation expense as a result of higher shipment volumes when
compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and approximately $7 million in expenses related to a reduction in workforce. These changes, coupled with the reduction in revenue of
$51 million from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, largely accounts for the decline in income (loss) before income taxes.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of October 31, 2004 (the Evaluation Date), Synopsys carried out an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Synopsys' management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of Synopsys' disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving
their control objectives. Subject to these limitations, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports Synopsys files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported as and when required.

(b)

Changes in Internal Controls.

There were no changes in Synopsys' internal controls over financial reporting during the three months

and is incorporated by reference here.


Director Compensation

Each member of the Board receives a retainer of $25,000 per year for attendance at Board meetings. Each member of the Audit Committee also receives $2,000 per
Audit Committee meeting attended other than the Chairperson, who receives $4,000 per Audit Committee meeting attended, in each case up to a maximum of four meetings per year.

Under
our 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan), 1,800,000 shares were authorized for issuance. The Directors Plan provided for automatic grants
to each non-employee member of the Board of Directors upon initial appointment or election to the Board, upon reelection and for annual service on Board committees. The option price was
100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Under the Directors Plan, as originally adopted, new directors received an option for 40,000 shares, vesting in equal installments over
four years. In addition, each continuing director who was reelected at an annual meeting of stockholders received an option for 20,000 shares and an additional option for 10,000 shares for each Board
committee membership, up to a maximum of two committee service grants per year. In August 2003, the Board amended the Directors Plan to reduce the size of the initial and committee grants to
30,000 and 5,000 shares, respectively. The annual and committee service option grants vested in full on the date immediately prior to the date of the annual meeting following their grant, assuming
continued board or committee service through such date. In the case of directors appointed to the Board between annual meetings, the annual and any committee grants were prorated based upon the amount
of time since the last annual meeting. The Directors Plan terminated as to future grants in October 2004. With the expiration of the Directors Plan, we expect to seek stockholder approval of a
new plan for non-employee directors at our 2005 annual meeting of stockholders.

During
fiscal 2004, Ms. Coleman, Drs. Newton and Somekh and Messrs. Bryant, Chizen, Walske and Vallee each received automatic grants of options to purchase 20,000 Synopsys
common shares at an exercise price of $29.87 per share for Synopsys Board of Directors service during the year. In addition, Ms. Coleman, Dr. Somekh and Messrs. Chizen, Walske and
Vallee each received two grants, and
Dr. Newton received one grant, of options to purchase 5,000 shares each at an exercise price of $29.87 per share for Synopsys Board of Directors Committee service during the year.

Change of Control Agreements and Named Executive Officer Employment Contracts

Under the 1992 Plan, in the event of certain changes in the ownership or control of Synopsys involving a "Corporate Transaction," which includes an acquisition of
Synopsys by merger or asset sale, each outstanding option under the 1992 Plan will automatically become exercisable, unless the option is assumed by the successor corporation, or parent thereof, or
replaced by a comparable option to purchase shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation or parent thereof.

In
addition, in the event of a successful hostile tender offer for more than 50% of the outstanding Synopsys common shares or a change in the majority of the Board of Directors as a
result of one or more contested elections for membership on the Board of Directors, the administrator of the 1992 Plan has the authority to accelerate vesting of outstanding options or shares
purchased under the 1992 Plan.

The
Directors Plan provides that in the event of a change of control or corporate transaction, as such terms are defined in the Directors Plan, all outstanding Directors Plan options
shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of such change of control or corporate transaction.

Synopsys
has entered into Employment Agreements, effective October 1, 1997, with its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its President and Chief Operating Officer. Each
Employment Agreement provides that if the executive is terminated involuntarily other than for cause within 24 months of a change of control, (a) the executive will be paid an amount
equal to two times the sum of the executive's annual base pay plus target cash incentive, plus the cash value of the executive's


health
benefits for the next 18 months, and (b) all stock options held by the executive will immediately vest in full. If the executive is terminated involuntarily other than for cause
in any other situation, the executive will receive a cash payment equal to the sum of the executive's annual base pay for one year plus the target cash incentive for such year plus the cash value of
the executive's health benefits for 12 months. The terms "involuntary termination," "cause" and "change of control" are defined in the Employment Agreements, each of which is filed with the
SEC.

Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

The Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs, Chizen and Walske. Prior to December 2003, the Compensation Committee consisted of
Ms. Coleman and Messrs. Bryant, Chizen and Walske. In December 2003, the Committee was reorganized to consist of Ms. Coleman and Messrs. Chizen and Walske.
Ms. Coleman resigned as a member of the committee in May 2004. Both of the current members of the committee satisfy the independence criteria of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. for serving on a compensation committee.

No
Compensation Committee member was at any time during fiscal 2004, or at any other time, an officer or employee of Synopsys or any of its subsidiaries.

No
executive officer of Synopsys serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on Synopsys' Board of Directors
or Compensation Committee.

Beneficial
ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Except as indicated by
footnote, and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe, based on information furnished by such persons and from Forms 13F and 13D filed with the SEC, that the persons named in
the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them as of November 15, 2004. Percentage of beneficial ownership
is based on 146,459,720 shares of common stock outstanding as of November 15, 2004, adjusted as required by rules promulgated by the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by
a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock issuable pursuant to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of
November 15, 2004 are deemed to be beneficially owned. Such shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

(2)

Based
solely on a Form 13F filed with the SEC on November 12, 2004 reporting beneficial ownership as of September 30, 2004. The shares are beneficially owned by
four institutional investment managers as follows: Barclays Global Investors, NA beneficially owns 11,914,992 shares, 10,393,442 shares over which it exercises sole voting power and 1,521,550 shares
over which it


exercises
no voting power; Barclays Global Investors LTD beneficially owns 2,204,624 shares, 2,197,704 shares over which it exercises sole voting power and 6,920 shares over which it exercises
no voting power; Barclays Global Fund Advisors beneficially owns 1,044,343 shares, 1,040,442 shares over which it exercises sole voting power and 3,901 shares over which it exercises no voting power;
and Barclays Global Investors Japan TR & Banking CO LTD beneficially owns 128,447 shares, all of which it exercises sole voting power over.

(3)

Based
solely on a Form 13F filed with the SEC on November 4, 2004 reporting beneficial ownership as of September 30, 2004. J. & W. Seligman & Co.
Incorporated exercises shared voting power over all of these shares.

(4)

Based
solely on Amendment No. 1 to Form 13F filed with the SEC on November 10, 2004 reporting beneficial ownership as of September 30, 2004. American
Century Investment Management, Inc. exercises sole voting power over 7,702,041 of these shares and exercises shared voting power over 26,600 of these shares.

(5)

Based
solely on Amendment No. 7 to a Form 13D filed with the SEC on November 10, 2004 reporting beneficial ownership as of November 1, 2004. The shares are
beneficially owned as follows: Blum Capital Partners L.P. ("Blum L.P.") and Richard C. Blum and Associates, Inc. ("RCBA Inc.") beneficially own 2,532,138 shares on behalf of the limited
partnerships for which Blum L.P. serves as the general partner, or on behalf of an entity for which Blum L.P. serves as investment advisor; Blum Strategic GP, L.L, C. ("Blum GP") beneficially owns
1,691,900 shares on behalf of the limited partnership for which it serves as the general partner; Blum Strategic GP II, L.L.C. ("Blum GP II") beneficially owns 3,235,550 shares held on behalf of the

regarding 72,300 legally owned by The Nuclear Decommissioning Trust of Dominion Nuclear Connecticut Inc. and 72,300 shares legally owned by Virginia Electric and Power Company Qualified Nuclear
Decommissioning Trust. As the sole general partners of Blum L.P., RCBA, Inc. is deemed the beneficial owner of shares over which Blum L.P. has voting and investment power. As Chairman, director
and a substantial shareholder of RCBA Inc., Richard C. Blum might be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by RCBA Inc., and the shares over which Blum GP

Item 13.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

Revenues derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10.8%, 9.5% and 7.9% of fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002
revenues, respectively. Andy D. Bryant, Intel Corporation's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer, also serves on Synopsys' Board of Directors. Management
believes the transactions between the two parties were carried out on an arm's length basis.

Synopsys
maintains a System-on-a-Chip Venture Fund (the Fund) authorized by the Company's Board which invests in companies that will facilitate
building SoCs. The Fund is administered by an investment advisory board consisting of senior Synopsys officers, including Synopsys' Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and
Dr. A. Richard Newton, a member of Synopsys' Board. The Fund has invested an aggregate of approximately $1 million in a private company that develops SoC test systems. At the times of
the investments, SmartForest Ventures, a venture capital firm, of which Synopsys director Deborah Coleman served as a general partner, owned in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares of such company.
Ms. Coleman did not participate in any of the Fund's investment decisions to invest in such company.

During
fiscal 2004, Dr. Newton provided consulting services to Synopsys and was paid $180,000. Under Synopsys' agreement with Dr. Newton, Dr. Newton provides advice,
at Synopsys' request, concerning long-term technology strategy and industry development issues as well as assistance in identifying opportunities for partnerships with academia.

advance by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, subject to certain exceptions relating to non-audit services accounting for less than five percent of the total fees paid to its
principal accountants which are subsequently ratified by the Audit Committee (the De Minimus Exception). In addition, pursuant to Section 10A(i)(3) of the Exchange Act, the Audit Committee has
established procedures by which the Chairperson of the Audit Committee may pre-approve such services provided the Chairperson report the details of the services to the full Audit Committee
at its next regularly scheduled meeting. None of the audit-related or non-audit services described above were performed pursuant to the De Minimus Exception during the periods in which the
