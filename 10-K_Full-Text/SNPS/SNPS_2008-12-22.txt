The Role of EDA in the Electronics Industry

Technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density, speed, power efficiency and functional
capacity of semiconductors (also referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips).

•

Since the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires imprinted on the chips that form the
transistors) and other developments have enabled IC manufacturers to follow "Moore's law," approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip.

•

Chips have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell
phones, digital cameras, music players and personal digital assistants.

•

Increasingly, single SoCs can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board.

Combined,
these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lower-cost, higher-performance computers, wireless communications networks, hand held
devices, internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has
introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as Synopsys.

These
technological challenges have been accompanied by significant business challenges, increased globalization leading customers to source their products in lower cost areas, and
consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products.

We
believe Synopsys is well positioned to help our customers meet these multi-faceted challenges. We have a broad portfolio of solutions that are highly integrated to solve our
customers' most advanced technological problems. We have a large number of global service and support engineers that help our customers complete their chip designs. We believe our combination of
advanced technology and global scale, along with our solid business execution, gives us a competitive advantage.

The IC Design Process

EDA software enables designers to create complex semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps
described below.

System Design.

The first step in a typical IC Design is determining the features and specifications of the chip, its overall architecture, and the division of
device functionality between hardware and software. Once the architecture is created and the division between hardware and software made, software engineers develop the embedded software applications
that drive an increasing proportion of the device functionality, while the chip designers develop the functionality and configuration of the semiconductor itself.

Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design.

RTL design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high
level computer language, typically SystemVerilog, Verilog or VHDL.



Logic Design.

Logic design, or "synthesis," programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a data file known as a netlist describing
the various groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip.

Functional Verification.

At the RTL level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools such as RTL simulators and testbench automation and other
verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended. The increasing size and complexity of today's ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip
designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to 70% of total design time. As a result, designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds, and that
can reduce verification risk (i.e., find design bugs before designs are taken into production).

Rapid Prototyping.

Rapid prototyping is a form of functional verification that uses hardware to accelerate verification in order to accommodate these significant
demands. It is also used to accelerate the development of embedded software by software engineers by essentially providing a "prototype" of the chip well before the chip is
completed—allowing software development to begin many months earlier than would otherwise be the case.

Physical Design.

In the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with "place
and route" products. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each block, a process known as
"placement." In many designs, placement is performed in conjunction with logic synthesis, a process known as "physical synthesis." After placement the designer adds the connections between the
transistors, a process known as "routing." With increasing gate counts and design complexity, seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important.

Physical Verification.

Before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a series of further verification steps,
checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip.

Manufacturing.

The design is then translated to a series of photomasks, or physical representations of the design. IC manufacturers use photomasks to produce the
silicon wafer containing individual ICs. As IC wire or "feature" sizes shrink, this translation is becoming more and more difficult. These challenges are exacerbated because in advanced designs the
feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process, requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to alter the
mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced. Technology computer-aided design, or TCAD, tools are also used to model individual features or "devices" within the design to help ensure
manufacturability. Finally, various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ICs contained on each silicon wafer.

Intellectual Property Reuse.

As IC designs continue to grow in size and complexity, designers have found that inserting pre-designed and
pre-verified design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and
comprehensively verified. Usually, such IP blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ICs, including microprocessors, digital signal processors, or connectivity IP that
support such protocols as USB, PCI Express or Ethernet.

Strategy

With increasing chip complexity, designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above
sequentially, and must repeat some steps, such as verification, multiple



times
before finishing the design. Each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet time-to-market goals. Synopsys addresses
these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms, enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next.

In
addition, smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before. Synopsys has invested
heavily in manufacturing-related technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield.

Also,
many hardware products contain increasingly complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is designed. We offer system-level products that permit
designers to develop such software earlier in the IC design process, speeding overall development time.

In
addition, designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition. We address this
issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality, pre-verified standards-based and other IP, which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence.

Finally,
designers rely on assistance from EDA engineers to help them complete their chips on time and with high quality. We help customers with both design services and application
engineer support.

Our
strategy is to help our customers get their products to market quickly and efficiently. In order to remain at the leading edge of technology development, we believe it is important
to continually invest in research and development, as well as targeted acquisitions. We also believe that offering customer support on a global basis is instrumental to addressing our customers'
needs.

Properties

.

In
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, an aggregate of 50%, 50% and 49%, respectively, of Synopsys' total revenue was derived from sales outside of the United States. Additional information
relating to
domestic and foreign operations, including revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, is contained in Note 11 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

in Part II, Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

and is included herein.



Synopsys'
aggregate backlog was approximately $2.6 billion on October 31, 2008, representing a 4% increase from backlog of $2.5 billion on October 31, 2007.
This increase is primarily due to the strength of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. Aggregate backlog represents the portion of committed orders that has not yet been recognized as revenue. We
expect backlog to fluctuate from year to year for several reasons, including specific timing and duration of large customer agreements and the schedule of when portions of that backlog are recognized
as revenue. As an illustration, for a single customer contract, associated backlog is high at the beginning of a renewable contract, low just prior to renewal of the contract and high again when the
contract is renewed. Low backlog attributable to a particular contract is typically associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of likelihood of renewal or future revenue from
such customer. Accordingly, we expect aggregate backlog to fluctuate from year to year depending upon the number and dollar amount of contracts at particular stages in their renewal cycle and such
fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future sales. Furthermore, backlog, particularly longer-term backlog, may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business
conditions may change and technologies may evolve, and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements. For this and other reasons, we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog
when anticipated. We have not historically experienced material order cancellations.

The
following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our five common groupings, or platforms, established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue for the
last three fiscal years. We include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods. For presentation
purposes, we allocate maintenance revenue, which represented approximately 5%, 6% and 9% of our total revenue in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to the products to which those support
services related.

Core
EDA is comprised of our Galaxy Design Platform and Discovery Verification Platform.

Revenue
derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenue for each of fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Research and Development

Our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms and to expand
our manufacturing, IP and system-level product offerings. Research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group. We also look to targeted acquisitions
to augment our own research and development efforts.

During
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, research and development expenses, excluding capitalized software development costs, were $394.7 million, $379.2 million and
$370.6 million, respectively. Synopsys' capitalized software development costs were approximately $3.0 million, $2.3 million and $3.5 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.



Competition

The EDA industry is highly competitive. We compete against other EDA vendors and against our customers' own design tools and internal
design capabilities. In general, we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license terms, post-contract
customer support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and payment terms.

Our
competitors include EDA vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services, primarily Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma Design
Automation, Inc. We also compete with other EDA vendors, including continual new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design
process, as well as with customers' internally developed design tools and capabilities. No one factor drives an EDA customer's buying decision, and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion
of our customers' budget.

Product Sales and Licensing Agreements

We typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only
and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. The majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the
software on a defined network, including, in some cases, regional or global networks. License fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed.

In
many cases, we provide our customers the right to "re-mix" a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified Synopsys products. For example, a customer
may use our front-end design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for back-end placement software for the remainder of the term in order
to complete the customer's IC design. This practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. The customer's re-mix of product, when so
provided under the customer agreement, does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer, which is governed by our revenue recognition policies. The ability to offer
this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products, because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor. At the same
time, because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced
revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without re-mix rights.

We
currently offer our software products under various license types: renewable TSLs, term licenses and perpetual licenses. For a full discussion of these licenses, see Part II,
Item 7.

Revenue Background

.

With
respect to our DesignWare Core intellectual property products, we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights
for specific applications. Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases, royalties.

Finally,
our Global Technical Services team providing design consulting services typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each
project.

Proprietary Rights

Synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure
agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. We have a diversified portfolio of more than 700 patents issued and more than 400 pending patent applications in



the
United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our issued patents have expiration dates through 2026. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology
used in connection with our products. Our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work. However, third parties may develop similar technology independently.
In
addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. We currently hold United States and foreign patents on some of the technologies
included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future. We are not significantly dependent upon any single patent, copyright, trademark or license with respect to our
proprietary rights.

In
many cases, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party's intellectual property
rights. As a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. For example, we are currently defending some of our customers against claims
that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it.

Employees

As of October 31, 2008, Synopsys had 5,691 employees, of which 2,856 were based in the United States.

Acquisitions in Fiscal 2008

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

We describe our business risk factors below.

The current severe downturn and uncertainty in the global economy in general and weakness in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may harm
our business and operating results.

The
worldwide economy is currently undergoing unprecedented turmoil amid stock market volatility, tightening of credit markets, concerns of inflation and deflation, decreased consumer
confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns and business insolvencies. This turmoil and the uncertainty about future economic
conditions could negatively impact our customers and, among other things, postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and jeopardize or delay their ability or willingness to make payment
obligations, any of which could adversely affect our business. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also cause volatility of our stock price. We cannot predict the timing,
strength or duration of this severe global economic downturn or subsequent recovery.

In
addition, the semiconductor and electronics industries are cyclical in nature and are currently experiencing a severe downturn. The EDA industry has been adversely affected by many
factors, including the current global downturn, ongoing efforts by semiconductor and electronics companies to reduce their spending, uncertainty regarding their long-term growth rate and
underlying financial health, excess EDA tool capacity and increased competition. These factors could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from
committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

If
the general economy and the semiconductor and electronics industries do not improve, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.

Customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results.

The
majority of our backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. A significant portion of revenue we
recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash. Although customer payment obligations are not cancelable, we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if
customers default, declare bankruptcy, or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed. Moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse
changes in their own businesses. Though we have not, to date, experienced a material level of defaults or renegotiation requests, if the current economic downturn is prolonged, our customers'
financial condition and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations could be adversely affected. If payment defaults by our customers significantly
increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments, our operating results would be harmed.

If we do not successfully compete in the EDA industry our business and financial condition will be harmed.

We
compete with EDA vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services, primarily Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma Design
Automation, Inc. We also compete with other EDA vendors, including continual new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design
process, as well as with customers' internally developed design tools and capabilities. We compete principally on technology leadership,
product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license terms, post contract customer support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and
payment terms. Specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success:

•

Technology in the EDA industry evolves rapidly and in order to be successful we must maintain technology leadership.
Accordingly, we must successfully anticipate and lead critical



developments,
innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products.

•

We believe that in order to be successful we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a
comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance. We have invested significant resources into the development of our Galaxy Design Platform, integration of our Discovery
Verification Platform and enhancement of our SystemVerilog and other advanced features and development of our Manufacturing Solutions and our IP and systems portfolios. Customers may not find these
tool and IP configurations more attractive than our competitors' offerings and our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance may not be successful.

•

Some EDA vendors are increasingly offering discounts, which could be significant, as price continues to be a competitive
consideration for our customers. If we do not match or are unable to match a competitor's pricing for a particular solution or if we are unable to otherwise enhance the value of our offering, we may
lose business, which would result in lost revenue and could harm our operating results, particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other EDA purchases
with the competitor.

•

We believe that in order to compete effectively, we need to enhance the value of our offering by providing additional
rights such as multiple copies of the tools, post-contract customer support, expanded license usage related to duration, location and quantity, contractor and site access, future purchase
rights and the ability to purchase pools of technology. If we do not match or are unable to match a competitor's offering, we may lose business, which would result in lost revenue and could harm our
operating results.

•

Payment terms are aggressively negotiated by our customers and affect our competitive position. Payment terms on
time-based licenses have generally lengthened over time. Longer payment terms could continue in the future, which could negatively affect our future revenue and operating cash flow.

•

The EDA industry is subject to continual consolidation. We and our competitors have historically acquired businesses and
technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. If any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to exert
even greater competitive pressure by offering a more complete or larger technology portfolio, a larger support and service capability, or lower prices.

•

Despite the complexity of the EDA market, entry and expansion into the EDA market by new and existing companies can and
does occur, and could make it more difficult to compete successfully.

In
addition, new competitive factors may emerge from time to time. If we fail to successfully compete as described above or fail to address new competitive forces our business will be
harmed.

Lack of growth in new IC design starts, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may adversely affect the EDA industry, including
demand for our products and services.

The
increasing complexities of SoCs and ICs, and customers' concerns about managing costs and risks have also led to the following potentially long-term negative trends in
our industry:

•

The number of IC design starts has remained flat during the last several years. New IC design starts are one of the key
drivers of demand for EDA software.

•

A number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely. Mergers can reduce
the aggregate level of purchases of EDA software and services,



and
in some cases, increase customers' bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including Synopsys.

•

Due to factors such as increased globalization, cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent,
adversely impacting our customers' EDA spending.

•

Industry changes, plus the cost and complexity of IC design, may be leading some companies in these industries to limit
their design activity in general, to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design.

All
of these trends, if sustained, could harm the EDA industry, including the demand for our products and services, which in turn would harm our financial condition and results of
operations.

Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our prior financial
statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various
bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles, or in our interpretations of these principles, can have a significant effect on our reported
results and may retroactively affect previously reported results.

We have received a Revenue Agent's Report from the Internal Revenue Service claiming a significant increase in our U.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

On
July 11, 2008, we received a Revenue Agent's Report in which the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, proposed an adjustment that would result in an aggregate tax deficiency for
fiscal 2002 through 2004 of
approximately $236.2 million, $130.5 million of which would be a reduction of certain tax credits that would otherwise be available either as refund claims or to offset taxes due in
future periods. In August 2008, we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which will cause the matter to be referred to the Appeals Office of the IRS. An adverse outcome of this
matter could result in significant tax expense and harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income
could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results.

Our
operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. A change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do
business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense.

Our
tax filings are subject to review or audit by the IRS and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes
and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The IRS examinations of our federal tax returns for the years
2000-2001 and 2002-2004 resulted in significant proposed adjustments. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final
determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. An assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit
could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

We
have operations both in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. Certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable
foreign tax rates. Therefore, any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions, including



those
resulting from transfer pricing adjustments and expiration of or amendments to foreign tax rulings, could materially increase our effective tax rate. Furthermore, we maintain deferred tax assets
related to federal foreign tax credits and our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the United States. Changes in our forecasts of such
future foreign source income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results.

Our revenue and earnings fluctuate and if our financial results fail to meet stockholder expectations our stock price could decline.

Many factors affect our revenue and earnings, including customer demand, license mix, the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold, causing our
revenue and earnings results to fluctuate. Accordingly, stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance.

From
time to time, we provide targets related to our future financial performance. In addition, financial analysts publish their own expectations of our future financial performance.
Because our quarterly revenue and our operating results fluctuate, future financial performance is difficult to predict. Downward adjustments of our targets or the failure to meet our targets or the
expectations of research analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

Some
of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include, but are not limited to:

•

The market for EDA products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers'
products, customer research and development and EDA budgets, pricing, our competitors' product offerings and customer design starts. It is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other
factors on our customers' demand for our products on a medium or long term basis. As a result, actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which, in turn, could cause
our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly disclosed targets.

•

We base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels
in advance of revenue being recognized. Since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income.

•

Our revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix
between upfront and time-based license revenue. The amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders, customer demand, customer
payment terms and ship dates could result in lower revenue and harm our operating results. For example, if we ship more licenses generating upfront revenue than expected during any given fiscal
period, our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target; conversely, if we ship fewer licenses generating upfront revenue than expected, our revenue
and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target. Similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of license orders
generating time-based revenue during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected.

•

We may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externally-communicated financial
targets, any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or could harm our business.

•

We often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new products. Although these amendments can
provide a longer-term payment stream from the customers,



they
can also result in a lower amount of revenue being recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value of the extended contract is larger.

•

Certain of our license agreements provide customers the right to re-mix a portion of the software initially
subject to the license for other specified Synopsys products. While this practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of these
arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately.

•

In the past, we have regularly received a significant portion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two
weeks of the quarter. The delay of one or more orders, particularly an order generating upfront revenue, could cause us to have lower revenue and/or earnings for that quarter.

•

A large portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers. While our agreements with such
customers are binding multi-year agreements, if we were to lose these customers or if they did not renew their agreements with us, over time our financial results could be adversely
affected.

•

We make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition, specifically determining the existence of proper
documentation, establishing that the fee is fixed or determinable, verifying delivery of our products and services and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers. While we believe our judgments
in these areas are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be challenged in the future. In such an event, we could be
required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods, which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods.

•

Our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either alone or against competing products,
before making a purchase decision. Accordingly, our customers' evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters. Further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers
delay project approvals or starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget cycles.

•

The sales cycle for our products is lengthy. The purchase of our products generally involves a significant commitment of
capital and other resources by a customer. This commitment often requires significant technical review, assessment of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within a
customer's organization. While our customers are evaluating our products and services, we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and spend significant management effort to complete these
sales. Any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter or the failure to complete a sale after expending resources during the sales cycle could cause our operating results to suffer.

•

We rely on third party subcontractors to manufacture our hardware products. Our reliance on third parties subjects us to
risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality, a potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors
outside our control such as capacity shortages and pricing changes. Our outsourcing model could lead to delays in product deliveries, lost sales and increased costs which could harm our relationships
with our customers resulting in lower operating results.

The failure to meet the semiconductor industry's demands for advancing EDA technology and continued cost reductions may harm our financial
results.

SoC
and IC functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of IC design and manufacturing. To address greater
complexity,



semiconductor
designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from EDA suppliers. At the same time, as a general business trend, we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking
to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk. In order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers'
technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. If we fail to successfully manage these conflicting
demands our financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.

We may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating
results.

If
new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than
anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development
efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic
incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results. In order to remain
competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development.

We may not be able acquire businesses or technology and we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the business acquisitions
or strategic investments we complete, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.

We
have acquired a number of companies or their assets in the past and expect to make additional acquisitions of businesses or technology in the future. We may not find suitable
acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results. We have acquired a number of
companies and technologies in recent years, including Synplicity, Inc. in May 2008. In addition to direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including:

•

Potential negative impact on our earnings per share;

•

Failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales;

•

Problems in integrating the acquired products with our products;

•

Difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into Synopsys;

•

Failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings;

•

Regulatory delays;

•

Drain on management time for acquisition-related activities;

•

Assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax, and unanticipated costs;



•

Diversion of resources and unanticipated expenses resulting from litigation arising from potential or actual business
acquisitions or investments; and

•

Adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships.

While
we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us, an acquisition may not positively affect our future performance. If we later
determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we will be required to write down intangible assets associated with the product or technology which would harm our operating results.

Conditions of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our
performance.

During
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we derived approximately 50% of our revenue from outside the United States. We expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on
substantial contributions from customers outside the United States. Foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions, including the effects of
international political conflict, hostilities and natural disasters. Further, any deterioration of foreign economies or foreign currency exchange rates would adversely affect our performance by
reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the United States.

Our
operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations can be adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens relative to
other currencies, including the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar, as a result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar.
Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. While we hedge most foreign currency exposures of our business, we are unable to hedge all of our currency exposures, and our hedging activities may not completely mitigate our
foreign currency risks.

In
addition, we have expanded our non-U.S. operations significantly in the past several years. While the increased international presence of our business creates the
potential for cost reductions and higher international sales, this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote locations
performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the United States. If we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and
results of operations will be harmed.

Our
operations and sales to customers internationally subject us to a number of additional risks, including:

•

international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business;

•

unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;

•

difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulatory requirements;

•

differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;

•

our inability to adapt to cultural differences in the conduct of business;

•

inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions;

•

exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and
restrictions;



•

financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and fluctuations in currency
exchange rates;

•

imposition of additional taxes and penalties; and

•

other factors beyond our control such as terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases.

Our investment portfolio may be impaired by further deterioration of the capital markets.

Our
cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of October 31, 2008 consists of investment grade municipal bonds, tax-exempt money market mutual
funds and taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy
sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer. As a result of current adverse financial market conditions, some financial instruments, such as structured investment
vehicles, sub-prime mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns. As of October 31, 2008, we had no
direct holdings in these categories of investments and our exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds was close to 0% of total cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, which we do not consider to be material. As of October 31, 2008, we had no impairment charge associated with our short-term
investment portfolio. However, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and our investment portfolio may suffer other than temporary impairments in future periods.

We
account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as "available-for-sale" under SFAS
No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely
impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may
fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be
other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any
debt securities we hold are classified as "available-for-sale," no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless
such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity, net of tax.

From time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights.

Under
our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. As a
result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. We are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our
products infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it.

These
types of claims can, however, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions
restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers
or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results.



If we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed.

Our
success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect
our proprietary technology. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by
competitors. Moreover, some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those
countries is therefore limited. We aggressively pursue action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies. We engaged in anti-piracy
efforts against certain companies located in China; but these actions may not be successful. We may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to:

•

assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property;

•

protect our trade secrets or know-how; or

•

determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others.

If
we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions,
our business and operating results would be harmed. In addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our
operating expenses and may reduce our net income.

Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance, which
could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

We
are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the SEC, NASDAQ and the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. Many of these regulations continue to evolve, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are
likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

In
particular, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and
our auditors to render an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports. This effort has required, and will continue to require in the future,
the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an unqualified opinion from our independent registered public accounting
firm could cause our stock price to decline.

There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls or control system will prevent all error and all fraud. Regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide
only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.



If we fail to timely recruit and retain key employees our business be harmed.

To
be successful, we must attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join Synopsys in connection with acquisitions. There are a limited number
of qualified EDA and IC design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. Our employees are often
recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. Any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees would harm our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

We
issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. We face pressure from stockholders, who must
approve any increases in our equity pool, to limit the use of such equity based compensation and its dilutive effect on stockholders. In addition, we are required under U.S. GAAP to recognize
compensation expense in our results from operations for employee equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which has increased the pressure to limit equity-based compensation. These factors
may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees.

Product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm reputation and we could lose market share.

Despite
extensive testing prior to releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or
when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. Product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new
products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. In addition, allegations of IC manufacturability issues resulting from use of our IP
products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license IP products from us. Any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of
products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any
one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.

Catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results.

We
rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. A disruption or
failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in
our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development
activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in California, near major earthquake faults. We believe we have developed sufficient disaster recovery plans
and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business
or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected.

Properties

United States Facilities

Our principal offices are located in four adjacent buildings in Mountain View, California, which together provide approximately 400,000
square feet of available space. This space is leased through February 2015. We occupy approximately 200,000 square feet of space in two adjacent buildings in Sunnyvale, California under lease through
October 2012, approximately 72,000 square feet of space in a third building in Sunnyvale under lease through April 2012, and approximately 66,000 square feet in a fourth building in Sunnyvale under
lease through February 2013. We use these buildings for administrative, marketing, research and development, sales and support activities. In addition, we lease approximately 80,000 square feet of
space in Marlboro, Massachusetts for sales and support, research and development and customer education activities. Beginning in January 2009, we will be extending the lease on this property until
October 2014 but reducing the amount of space leased to approximately 56,000 square feet. We currently lease 18 other offices throughout the United States, primarily for sales and support activities.

We
own two buildings totaling approximately 230,000 square feet on approximately 43 acres of land in Hillsboro, Oregon, one of which is currently vacant. The other is used for
administrative, marketing, research and development and support activities.

We
own a third building in Sunnyvale, California with approximately 120,000 square feet, which is leased to a third party through April 2009. We also own 13 acres of undeveloped land in
Marlboro, Massachusetts.

International Facilities

We lease approximately 45,000 square feet in Dublin, Ireland for our foreign headquarters and for research and development purposes. In
addition, we lease foreign sales and service offices in Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. We also lease research and development facilities in Armenia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, India, Japan, the
Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

As
a result of acquisitions, we have assumed leases in a number of foreign and domestic locations. Following each acquisition, where feasible, we consolidate the acquired company's
employees and operations into our existing local sites. In such cases, we generally seek to sublease the assumed space or negotiate with the landlord to terminate the underlying lease.

We
believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs.

The following graph compares the 5-year total return to stockholders of our common stock relative to the cumulative total
returns of the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology Index. This year's graph also includes the return of the NASDAQ Composite Index. Synopsys believes that because our common stock
is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of the NASDAQ Stock Market, the NASDAQ Composite Index is a useful broad equity market index against which to compare the performance of our common stock.
Synopsys intends to use the NASDAQ Composite Index as a comparative index going forward. The graph assumes that $100 was invested on October 31, 2003 in us and in each of the indexes and that
all dividends were reinvested. No cash dividends were declared on our common stock during such time. The comparisons in the table are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and are not

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the
more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of
Part 1 of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements.

Business Environment Summary

We generate substantially all of our revenue from customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries. Our customers typically
fund purchases of our software and services largely out of their research and development (R&D) budgets and, to a lesser extent, their manufacturing and capital budgets. As a result, our customers'
business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs affect their spending decisions and vendor selections.

Over
the past several years, customers have increasingly faced competing challenges of technological complexity and cost pressures. Many electronics companies have refined their business
strategies by focusing on their areas of differentiation and in some cases exiting non-differentiating areas. For example, some have outsourced semiconductor manufacturing to a third party
foundry or manufacturing consortium. These challenges have varying impacts on members of the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry in which we operate. The EDA industry is very competitive.
While the importance of offering a broad, integrated portfolio of solutions, along with sizeable, global support, continues to grow, no one factor drives an EDA customer's buying decision and we
compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers' budget. Our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights.

Many
of our customers are large businesses, purchasing substantially all of the capabilities our products offer. Our customers are increasingly focused on reducing their overall costs by
demanding a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services. In addition, they bargain intensely on all aspects of the contractual arrangement, seeking more favorable terms at an overall lower
cost. As such, customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.

We
provide our products in four common groupings, or platforms, with hundreds of products within each platform. We enhance the value of our offerings by providing additional rights such
as multiple copies of the tools, post-contract customer support, expanded license usage related to duration, location and quantity, contractor and site access, future purchase rights and
other unique rights. In some instances, we provide customers with the ability to purchase pools of technology to address a broad spectrum of their design needs and enable our customers to exchange
certain quantities of licensed software for unspecified future technology. We also offer post-contract customer support and services. These elements of added value, in addition to
per-copy pricing, are some of the many factors which our customers consider when making purchasing decisions.

Historically,
revenue has grown primarily as a result of increased customer demand for these additional rights related to our products, and, more recently, as a result of the impact of
our business model shift as discussed below. In general, as our customers negotiate increased rights, the value of the contracts with those customers increases. Collectively, the increase in the value
of all of our customer contracts is the primary driver of our overall growth in revenue over time. As further described below, the effect of
an increase in value for a particular customer is typically recognized over the life of the customer contract rather than in the particular period in which the enhanced license transaction is
completed.

As
a result of customers seeking to conserve cash, we shifted our business model in the fourth quarter of 2004 to allow a substantial majority of our customers to pay for licenses over a
period of



time,
rather than upfront at the time of initial purchase. Extended payment terms, as well as arrangements with technology pools and rights to unspecified future products, generate recurring revenue
over a period of time, generally three years, rather than non-recurring upfront license revenue. Accordingly, most of the revenue we recognize in any particular quarter results from our
selling efforts in each of the prior periods during the last three or so years rather than from efforts or changes in the current period. This business model reduces our dependence on license
arrangements that generate non-recurring upfront license revenue in a particular period and provides us with the ability to resist typical software industry quarter-end
pressures and to decline business with terms, including pricing terms, which may be less favorable to us. We continue to target achieving greater than 90% of our total revenue as recurring revenue,
which we refer to in our financial statements as time-based license and maintenance and service revenue.

Fiscal 2008 Financial Performance Summary

•

Total revenue of $1,337.0 million was up 10% from $1,212.5 million in fiscal 2007. The increase was
primarily attributable to bookings of Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs) in prior periods which increase time-based revenue recognized in later periods and to a lesser extent from
Synplicity product sales from our acquisition in May 2008.

•

Time-based license revenue of $1,125.8 million was up 12% from $1,004.0 million in fiscal 2007.
The increase was primarily attributable to bookings of TSLs in prior periods which increase time-based revenue recognized in later periods.

•

Upfront license revenue of $71.4 million was up 6% from $67.5 million in fiscal 2007. The increase included
the impact of Synplicity product sales.

•

We derived approximately 95% of our total revenue from time-based revenues, maintenance and services, and 5%
from upfront revenue in fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 94% and 6%, respectively, in fiscal 2007. This reflects our continued adherence to our business model.

•

Maintenance revenue of $66.6 million was down 8% from $72.2 million in fiscal 2007. This decrease in
maintenance revenue was primarily attributable to the fact that maintenance has been bundled and not charged separately after the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
Professional service and other revenue of $73.1 million was up 6% from $68.7 million in fiscal 2007, increased primarily due to the timing and acceptance of performed milestones under
existing service contracts.

•

Net income of $190.0 million was up 46% from $130.5 million in fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily due
to increases in revenues.

Fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 Acquisitions

We have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years, and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services
offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future. Below is a list of our principal acquisitions during the last three fiscal years. See Note 3 of

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information on our acquisitions, which information is included herein.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading "Result of Operations" below are based on our audited
consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and
estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and net income. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience
and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see
Note 2

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The
accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations,
are:

•

Revenue recognition;

•

Valuation of share-based compensation;

•

Valuation of intangible assets; and

•

Income taxes.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and service revenue. Software license revenue consists of fees
associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees.



We
have designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue
Recognition,

as amended and EITF 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.

With
respect to software licenses, we utilize three license types:

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

are time-based
licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We bundle and do
not charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license.

•

Term Licenses

are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer
any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the
term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

•

Perpetual Licenses

continue as long as the customer renews maintenance
plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase
maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually.

For
the three software license types, we recognize revenue as follows:

•

TSLs.

We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees (which
include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as
"time-based license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations.

•

Term Licenses.

We recognize revenue from term licenses in
full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
Revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as "upfront license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee is due
within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as "time-based license revenue" in the consolidated statement
of operations.

•

Perpetual Licenses.

We recognize revenue from perpetual
licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are
met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as "upfront license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license
fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as
"time-based license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations.

We
generally recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. If a technology subscription license is incorporated into the
hardware, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the software license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to these hardware
sales is reported as "upfront license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations.

In
addition, we recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received and recognize revenue from professional service and
training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as "maintenance and service revenue" in
the consolidated statement of operations.



Our
determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for
each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately.

We
have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance
components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual
and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and we recognize revenue from professional services as milestones
are performed and accepted. We recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to allocate
the TSL fee between license and maintenance services.

We
make significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of
the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition
criteria as follows:

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.

Prior to
recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a
standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement.

•

Delivery Has Occurred.

We deliver our products to our
customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software by downloading it to the
customer's hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders.
However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational
capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a quarter.

•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable.

Our determination that
an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement's payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the license fee to
be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming
all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer
installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for
a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers' installments become due and payable, even if the fee is otherwise fixed or determinable.

•

Collectability is Probable.

We judge collectability of the
arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For
a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to us, we evaluate the customer's financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on
that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer.



If
we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer's payment history, we recognize revenue under that
arrangement as customer payments are actually received.

Valuation of Share-Based Compensation.

We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)). Under SFAS No. 123(R), share-based compensation expense is
measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock
options and
employee stock purchase plan awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and the risk-free
interest rates. We estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price
volatility over the estimated expected term of our share-based awards. We determine the expected term of our share-based awards based on historical experience. In addition, judgment is required in
estimating the forfeiture rate on share-based awards. We calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends. These input factors are subjective and are determined using
management's judgment. If a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining share-based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input
factors used in determining future share-based compensation costs. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods
thereafter.

Valuation of Intangible Assets.

We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer-installed base/relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not
to compete, customer backlog, capitalized software development and other intangibles. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected
historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or
economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its
remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining
amortization period, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period. Any such impairment charge could be significant
and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2008. As of October 31, 2008, the
carrying amount of our intangible assets, was $114.8 million.

Income Taxes.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes

(SFAS 109). Our estimates and assumptions used in such provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the
required adjustments when they are identified and resolved.

We
adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

(FIN 48) and FASB Staff Position No. 48-1 (FSP FIN 48-1) in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The interpretation
contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is
to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 48-1 which amended



FIN 48
to provide guidance about how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. Under FSP
FIN 48-1, a tax position could be effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which we expect the differences to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to
utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and
our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the
forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of
$302.7 million that are recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a
portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.

Included
in our net deferred tax assets are federal foreign tax credits of $70.1 million of which $63.9 million will expire from fiscal 2013 through 2018 and the remaining
$6.2 million in foreign tax credits from acquired companies, which have a valuation allowance of $3.4 million, will expire between fiscal 2009 and 2017. Foreign tax credits can only be
carried forward ten years, unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period, and may only be used after foreign tax credits arising in
each subsequent year have been used first. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period. We have recorded a
valuation allowance of $19.7 million during the fiscal year with respect to our foreign tax credit carryforward, of which $14.6 million was recorded as a result of the
2000-2001 final IRS settlement. See

Results of Operations—Income Taxes—IRS Examinations,

below, and Note 9 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The need for a valuation allowance with respect to foreign tax credits is subject to change based upon a
number of factors, including the amount of foreign tax credits arising in future years, our forecasts of future foreign source income, the amount of our undistributed earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries and changes in income tax laws that may affect our ability to use such credits.

As
of October 31, 2008, we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the United
States. If the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future, we would provide taxes on such excess amount. As of October 31, 2008,
there was approximately $243.0 million of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided.

In
addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws. We are also subject to examination by various
taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed, we would reverse the
liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would
record an additional charge to earnings. See

Statements

for a discussion of the Revenue Agent's Reports from the IRS we received in June 2005 and July 2008 asserting
very large net increases to our U.S. tax arising from the audit of fiscal 2000 through 2001 and fiscal 2002 through 2004, respectively.



Results of Operations

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest October 31. Our current fiscal year ended November 1, 2008. Every seven
years we have one extra week in our fiscal year that occurs in our first quarter. Fiscal 2008 and 2006 were 52-week years. Fiscal 2007 was a 53-week fiscal year and the
additional week was contained in the first quarter. The extra week in fiscal 2007 resulted in approximately $18.7 million of additional revenue related primarily to time-based
licenses and approximately $17.2 million of additional expenses.

Revenue Background

We generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses, hardware products, maintenance and professional services. Under current
accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses and services at varying times. In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order
over the license term and on a term
or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is shipped. Substantially all of our current time-based licenses are TSLs with an average license term of
approximately three years. Maintenance orders normally bring in revenue ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year). Revenue from professional service orders is generally recognized as
milestones are performed and accepted by the customer. Upon the acquisition of Synplicity, we began selling hardware products and to recognize revenue generally upon shipment. A more complete
description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

.

Our
revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time-based license, upfront license, hardware product sales, maintenance and professional service revenue for the
period. We derive time-based license revenue in any quarter largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters. We derive upfront license revenue directly from term and
perpetual license orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter. We derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance
orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional service revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from
professional services when those services are delivered and accepted, not when they are booked.

Our
license revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but
contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but
$10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters. Conversely, perpetual licenses and term licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate
current quarter revenue but no future revenue (e.g., a $120,000 order for a perpetual license generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped, but no future revenue).

The
increase in total revenue for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to bookings in prior years leading to increased current period time-based license
revenue. Additionally, total revenue increased by approximately 1% due to the strength of the Japanese yen against the U.S dollar. The increase was partially offset by fiscal 2008 having one less week
of revenue of approximately $18.7 million compared to fiscal 2007.



The
increase in total revenue for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to (1) increased bookings of licenses generating time-based revenue reflecting
the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the transition to more TSLs in prior periods that continued to contribute to time-based license revenue in later periods,
and (2) the fact that fiscal 2007 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2006, resulting in one week's additional time-based revenue being recognized in fiscal
2007. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and service revenue. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact to fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.

As
discussed above in the

Business Environment Summary,

we shifted our business model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2008
and forward, the model shift itself no longer contributes to the increases in total revenue or time-based revenue.

The
increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to higher bookings in fiscal 2007 which contributed to the increase of
time-based license revenue in fiscal 2008. TSL revenue continued to be the major contributor to total revenue since our business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In
addition, but to a lesser extent, the increase in time-based license revenue in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 resulted from entering into more contracts in which revenue was recognized as
installment payments become due and payable. The increase was partially offset by fiscal 2008 having one less week of revenues of approximately $17.2 million compared to fiscal 2007.

Our
maintenance revenue declined in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to (1) our completed shift towards TSLs, which include maintenance with the license fee and
thus generate no
separately recognized maintenance and service revenue, and (2) the first quarter of fiscal 2008 having one less week of revenues, resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately
$1.5 million compared to fiscal 2007.

Our
maintenance revenue declined in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to our shift towards TSLs, which include maintenance with the license fee and thus generate no
separately recognized maintenance revenue, as well as non-renewal of maintenance by some customers on perpetual or term licenses.

Professional
services and other revenue increased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, and increased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to timing of customer
acceptance of performance milestones and services performed under ongoing contracts.

Events Affecting Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses

Functional Allocation of Operating Expenses.

We allocate certain human resource, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement
based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the
allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool.

We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of license revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. Expenses directly associated
with providing consulting and training are allocated between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and service revenue reported.

Cost of license revenue.

Cost of license revenue includes costs associated with our software product sales as well as our costs of materials associated with our
hardware products. Additionally, cost of license revenue also includes allocated costs of license delivery, such as employee salaries and benefits related to software production costs, product
packaging, product delivery, amortization of capitalized software development costs, documentation and royalties to third party vendors.

Cost of maintenance and service revenue.

Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes employee salary and benefits for consulting professionals and associated
costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization. Further, cost of maintenance and service revenue also includes allocated costs which provide post
customer contract services, such as employee salary and benefits related to customer services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance
updates.

Amortization of intangible assets.

Amortization of intangible assets, which is amortized to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of
the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, covenants not to compete and other
intangibles related to acquisitions.

Cost
of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was flat at 19% for both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. The increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was
primarily due to (1) an increase of $20.8 million in personnel-related costs as a result of our acquisition of Synplicity in fiscal 2008, (2) an increase of $2.7 million in
functionally allocated expenses as previously described, and (3) an increase of $2.9 million in direct costs as a result of hardware costs. The increase was partially offset by
(1) the decline in fair value of $2.0 million in our deferred compensation plan obligation, and (2) one less week of costs of approximately $3.6 million in fiscal 2008
compared with fiscal 2007.

The
increase in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to (1) an increase of $12.6 million in compensation and employee benefits due
to our increased personnel costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and in late fiscal 2006, (2) an increase of $1.2 million in direct costs as a result of increased shipments
during fiscal 2007, (3) 53 weeks of costs in fiscal 2007 instead of 52 weeks in fiscal 2006, and (4) $1.0 million increase in functionally allocated expenses. This
increase was partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in amortization of certain intangible assets as a result of intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized during
fiscal 2007.

The
increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to (1) an increase of $32.0 million in employee personnel related
costs as a result of headcount increases, including from our recent acquisition, and (2) an increase of $7.6 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described compared
to fiscal 2007. The increase was


partially
offset by (1) $18.4 million decline in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation as a result of the overall decline of the financial market, (2) the
absence of a $3.1 million earn-out/retention bonus related to a prior year acquisition, and (3) one extra week of costs incurred in fiscal 2007 of approximately
$6.6 million.

The
increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an increase of $17.5 million in increased personnel and related costs
as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and in late fiscal 2006, in addition to an extra week of expenses in fiscal 2007. This increase was partially offset by (1) a decrease of
$3.8 million in share-based compensation expense, (2) a decrease of $4.8 million in general operational activities such as expenses for travel, entertainment,
communications, depreciation, and (3) to a lesser extent by reductions in functionally allocated expenses compared to fiscal 2006.

$5.4 million compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million in employee, travel and communication related expenses.

The
increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to (1) an increase of $13.3 million in variable compensation as a
result of increased shipments, and (2) an increase of $11.3 million in sales and marketing personnel related costs, employee functions and an extra week of expense in fiscal 2007. This
increase was partially offset by a decrease of $3.3 million in general operation activities such as travel, entertainment, communications, depreciation and a $2.8 million reduction in
functionally allocated expenses compared to fiscal 2006.

increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to (1) an increase of $7.2 million in personnel related costs,
and (2) an absence of $4.3 million gain for a land sale completed during fiscal 2007 and recorded as an offset to expense under this line item. The increase was partially offset by
(1) $5.0 million decline in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation, and (2) one less week of expenses of approximately $1.5 million in fiscal 2008
compared to fiscal 2007.

The
decrease in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to (1) a decrease of $8.6 million in expenses related to
professional services primarily for legal, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, tax and audit matters, (2) a decrease of $3.2 million in depreciation expense as a result of improving
efficiencies in our operations and cost control efforts, and (3) a gain of $4.3 million, net of related expenses, for a land sale recorded as an offset to expense


under
this line item. These decreases were offset by (1) an increase of $2.9 million in expense related to facility operations, (2) a net increase of $2.3 million in
functionally allocated expenses , and (3) an extra week of expenses in fiscal 2007.

Change in Fair Value of Deferred Compensation.

The income or loss due to the change in fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded
in each functional operating expense. The offsetting income or loss due to the change in fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan asset is recorded in other income, net.
The overall net impact to our consolidated statements of operations from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and assets is immaterial for all periods presented.

The
decrease in fair value of deferred compensation plan obligation is reported in total cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative
expenses. The year-over-year effect of the fair value change is approximately $33.4 million. This change is a result of the declining financial markets in fiscal 2008.
Correspondingly, the decrease in the fair value of the deferred compensation plan asset is approximately $32.8 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and reported in other income, net.
Change in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan did not have a material impact to total cost of revenue or total operating expenses in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. See Note 8 and 10
of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

—Employee Benefit Plans and Other (Loss) Income, Net.

Effect of Foreign Currency on Expenses.

Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact to expenses during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
2007 or fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.

In-Process Research and Development.

In-process research and development (IPRD) expense is comprised of in-process technologies of
$4.8 million associated with the acquisition of Synplicity in fiscal 2008, $3.2 million associated with the acquisitions of ArchPro Design Automation and Sandwork Design in fiscal 2007,
and $0.8 million associated with the acquisition of HPL Technologies in fiscal 2006. At the date of each acquisition, the projects associated with the IPRD efforts had not yet reached
technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of
the acquired companies.

Valuation of IPRD.

Upon acquisition of other companies, we expense any IPRD as it represents incomplete research and development projects that had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The value assigned to IPRD is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall
development plan, estimating costs to develop the IPRD into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value. The utilized discount rate is our weighted-average cost of capital, taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of
such technology, the successful development of the IPRD, its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which are unknown at the time of determination.

Synplicity.

On May 15, 2008, we acquired Synplicity, Inc. (Synplicity), a leading supplier of innovative FPGA and IC design and verification
solutions. The IPRD expense related to this acquisition was $4.8 million, and consisted of four primary projects in process at the time of acquisition: FPGA, ASIC Verification, DSP, and HAPS.
We expect that these projects will be completed over a period of approximately two years.


Sandwork.

On October 1, 2007, we acquired Sandwork Design, Inc. (Sandwork), a company with tools to efficiently analyze and debug complex Analog
Mixed Signal (AMS)
systems-on-chips (SoCs). The IPRD expense related to this acquisition was $1.1 million. Sandwork had two projects in process at the time of acquisition which we
anticipate will be completed over a period of approximately two years.

ArchPro.

On June 14, 2007, we acquired ArchPro Design Automation, Inc. (ArchPro), a company with modern power management verification technologies.
The IPRD expense related to the ArchPro acquisition was $2.1 million. ArchPro had several projects in process at the time of acquisition which we anticipate will be completed over a period of
approximately two years.

HPL.

On December 7, 2005, we acquired HPL Technologies, Inc. (HPL), a yield management and test chip technology company. The IPRD expense related to
the HPL acquisition was $0.8 million. HPL had one IPRD project which was completed during fiscal 2006 and the resulting products have begun to generate revenue. The expenditures to complete
HPL's acquired in-process technologies approximated the original estimates.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the
amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in prior years.
Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:

Amortization
of capitalized software development costs is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.

The
decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to completion of the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in
prior years' acquisitions, partially offset by the intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of Synplicity.

The
decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to completion of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in prior
year's acquisitions.

Income Taxes

The relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate. We are also subject to
changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate. As of October 31, 2008, current deferred tax assets, net of current deferred tax liabilities, totaled $133.6 million.
Non-current deferred tax assets, net of non-current deferred tax liabilities, totaled $169.1 million. We believe it is more likely than not that our results of future
operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets. We consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the
need for any valuation allowance, and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would record a charge to income and an adjustment to
the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination.

Included
in our net deferred tax assets are federal foreign tax credits of $70.1 million of which $63.9 million will expire from fiscal 2013 through 2018 and the remaining
$6.2 million in foreign tax credits from acquired companies, which have a valuation allowance of $3.4 million, will expire between
fiscal 2009 and 2017. Foreign tax credits can only be carried forward ten years, unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period, and
may only be used after foreign tax credits arising in each subsequent year have been used first. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income
during the carryforward period. We recorded a valuation allowance of $19.7 million during fiscal 2008 with respect to our foreign tax credit carryforward, of which $14.6 million was
recorded as a result of the 2000-2001 final IRS settlement. See

Results of Operations—Income Taxes—IRS Examinations,

below, and Note 9 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The need for a valuation allowance with respect to foreign tax credits is
subject to change based upon a number of factors, including the amount of foreign tax credits arising in future years, our forecasts of future foreign source income, the amount of our undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changes in income tax laws that may affect our ability to use such credits.

As
of October 31, 2008, we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the United
States. If the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future, we would provide taxes on such excess amount. As of October 31, 2008,
there was approximately $243.0 million of earnings upon which income taxes have not been provided.

The
fiscal 2008 tax rate is lower than fiscal 2007 primarily due to a favorable resolution being reached on transfer pricing issues related to the 2000-2001 IRS examination
and additional research credits claimed on our 2007 federal and state tax returns. In addition, in October 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was enacted, which retroactively
extended the research and development credit from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. The fiscal 2007 tax rate is lower than fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower withholding taxes
as a result of restructuring of certain of our foreign operations, and increased research credits. For fiscal 2006, the effective tax rate includes state tax expense of $5.5 million for prior
year state taxes, primarily as a result of state tax audits settled and a settlement offer made in fiscal 2006 and associated interest and penalties, as well as a reduction in an estimated fiscal 2005
state research and development credit benefit.

Tax Effects of Stock Awards.

In November 2005, FASB issued a Staff Position (FSP) on FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition Election Related to
Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.

Effective upon issuance, this FSP describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of
share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital
pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee
share-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). We elected to use the alternative transition method in fiscal 2006 and have not recognized any excess tax
benefits during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. No tax benefit was recorded in the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 for expenses relating to the vesting of qualified stock options and share-based
compensation costs which are borne by certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

IRS Examinations

We are regularly audited by the IRS.

Fiscal years 2000-2001

On June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) in which the IRS proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal
years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. This proposed adjustment primarily related to transfer pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly owned foreign
subsidiary. On July 13, 2005, we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the matter to be referred to the Appeals Office of the IRS. On June 30, 2008, the
IRS and Synopsys executed a final Closing Agreement pursuant to which substantially all of the proposed assessment was eliminated.

As
a result of the final resolution of the transfer pricing issue, we decreased our FIN 48 liabilities by $41.0 million in the third quarter of 2008, including interest
accrued of $2.8 million and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital of $0.3 million. Concurrently, we evaluated our ability to use certain foreign tax credit carryovers which
have been recorded as noncurrent deferred tax assets in its



balance
sheet, a portion of which may have been available to offset the FIN 48 liability. We concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that $14.6 million of our foreign tax
credits will be used prior to the expiration of the carryover period, and recorded a valuation allowance for this amount. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes includes an income tax benefit
(net of decreases in related deferred tax assets) of $17.3 million as a result of the 2000-2001 IRS settlement.

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the statute of limitations remains open with respect to fiscal years 2000-2001 for two related issues until the Appeals Office of the IRS has
considered certain refund claims relevant to these years which are affected by the fiscal year 2002-2004 federal income tax audit. We have accrued the tax for these issues in accordance
with a tentative settlement we reached with the IRS in December 2007.

Fiscal years 2002-2004

In the third quarter of 2006, the IRS started an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2004. In July
2008, the IRS completed its field examination of these returns and issued an RAR in which the IRS proposed an adjustment that would result in an aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period of
approximately $236.2 million, $130.5 million which would be a reduction of certain tax losses and credits that would otherwise be available either as refund claims or to offset taxes due
in future periods. The IRS is contesting our tax
deduction for payments made in connection with litigation between Avant! Corporation and Cadence Design Systems, Inc. In addition, the IRS has alleged that we are required to make an additional
transfer pricing adjustment with a wholly owned non-U.S. subsidiary as a result of our acquisition of Avant! in 2002. The IRS has also proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing
arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries, deductions for foreign trade income and certain temporary differences. We have agreed to additional taxes of approximately $20.0 million for these
proposed adjustments, which have been fully provided for in prior years. The total adjustments proposed by the IRS, if sustained, would also result in additional state taxes (net of the federal tax
benefit for state taxes paid) of approximately $17.0 million. The IRS imposes interest on any resulting tax deficiencies.

On
August 9, 2008, we timely filed a protest with the IRS and will seek resolution of these issues through the Appeals Office of the IRS. We strongly believe that the proposed IRS
adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that we have meritorious defenses to this proposed adjustment. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of
Deficiency. We believe we have adequately provided for all potential tax liabilities related to these years. Final resolution of these matters is expected to take several years.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds
that may be drawn down under our credit facility.

Cash provided by operating activities.

Cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. To be classified as upfront
revenue, we require that 75% of a term or
perpetual license fee be paid within the first year. Conversely, payment terms for TSLs are generally extended and the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually in even increments
over the term of the license. Accordingly, we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from time-based licenses revenue.

Fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008.

Cash from operating activities decreased primarily due to the timing of billings and cash payments from customers compared to fiscal
2007, delivering lower cash inflows during fiscal 2008 and also as a result of a litigation settlement of $12.5 million received from Magma during fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007.

Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased collections largely as a result of payments received from a
significant customer, a litigation settlement of $12.5 million received from Magma during fiscal 2007, and decreased commission payments and timing of payments to vendors compared to fiscal
2006.

Cash used in investing activities.

Fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008.

The decrease in cash used in investing activities primarily relates to the sale of marketable securities for our acquisition of
Synplicity, and as a result of lower capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007.

The increase in cash used primarily relates to acquisitions, purchases of marketable securities related to our increased collections
and the timing of maturities of marketable securities, and our capital expenditures to support our information technology infrastructure, partially offset by cash received for the sale of land in San
Jose, California for $26.3 million, net of related fees.

Cash (used in) provided by financing activities.

Fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008.

The increase in cash used in financing activities primarily relates to larger common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase
program and a lower number of employee option exercises compared to fiscal 2007. See Note 7 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for
details of our stock repurchase program.



Fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007.

The increase in cash provided primarily relates to a higher amount of option exercises by employees and lower stock repurchases under
our stock repurchase program compared to fiscal 2006.

We
hold our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and in foreign accounts, primarily in Ireland, Bermuda, and Japan. As of October 31,
2008, we held an aggregate of $501.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and an aggregate of $449.7 million in foreign accounts.
Funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside North America. At present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries as described in "Income
Taxes" above.

We
expect cash provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including timing of our billings and collections, our operating
results, the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions.

Our
accounts receivable and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 38 days at October 31, 2008 and
36 days at October 31, 2007. The increase in DSO along with a slight increase in accounts receivable balance primarily relates to timing of billings to customers that occurred during the
year with subsequent payment terms and our collections.

Net Working Capital.

Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 31,
2008, our net working capital was $413.3 million, compared to $296.5 million as of October 31, 2007. The increase of $116.8 million was primarily due to (1) an
increase in accounts receivable of $23.5 million, (2) an increase in income taxes receivable of $7.3 million, (3) an increase in current deferred income tax asset of
$10.4 million, and (4) a decrease of $193.1 million primarily due to a reclassification from short-term accrued income taxes to long-term accrued income
taxes upon our adoption of FIN 48. This increase was partially offset by (1) a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $33.2 million,
(2) a decrease in prepaid and other assets of $13.3 million, (3) an increase in deferred revenue of $27.4 million, and (4) an increase of $43.6 million in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Other Commitments

—Credit Facility. On October 20, 2006, we entered into a five-year, $300.0 million
senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to Synopsys and certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional
$150.0 million through the fourth year of the facility. The facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as
other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on October 20, 2011. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent's prime rate or
the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at Eurodollar rates plus a spread between 0.50% and 0.70% based on a pricing grid tied to
a financial
covenant. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.125% and 0.175% per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. As of October 31, 2008, we
had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants.



Other

Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of October 31, 2008 consists of investment grade
municipal bonds, tax-exempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit
our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer. As a result of current adverse financial market conditions,
some financial instruments, such as structured investment vehicles, sub-prime mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, may pose risks arising from liquidity and
credit concerns. As of October 31, 2008, we had no direct holdings in these categories of investments and our exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money
market mutual funds was close to 0% of total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which we do not consider to be material. During fiscal 2008 we had no impairment charge
associated with our short-term investment portfolio. While we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, we have taken steps, including regularly reviewing our
investments and associated risk profiles, which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio.

We
believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our credit facility will satisfy our
business requirements for at least the next twelve months.

(3)

Purchase
obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not
received the goods or services as of October 31, 2008. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel,
reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

(4)

Long
term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2008 recorded in accordance with FIN 48. Currently, a
reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal 2009 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and
controversies.



In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to October 31, 2008, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $2.4 million in cash
during the two years subsequent to fiscal 2009 if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved. Because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals, these
amounts are not reflected in the table above.

The
expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the
time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone-based obligations depend on the achievement of the
milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly.

As
of October 31, 2008, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a) (4)(ii) of SEC
Regulation S-K.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. The primary
objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our
portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of our
investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument.

The
following table presents the carrying value and related weighted-average total return for our investment portfolio as of October 31, 2008:

As
of October 31, 2008, the stated maturities of our current short-term investments are $99.3 million within one year, $93.4 million within one to five
years, $41.1 million within five to ten years and $139.8 million after ten years. However, we consider these investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance
with our investment policy, the weighted-average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term obligations and
other uses including acquisitions. These investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax.

Foreign Currency Risk.

We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of each of
our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency, except for our principal Irish, Swiss and Hungarian subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the U.S. dollar. We enter
into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and
balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on
previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various
currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts ranges from one month to 19 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in
Note 2 and Note 5 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional
currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if
the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2008, the
fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $8.9 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $8.9 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the
same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline,



resulting
in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $8.9 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.

Net
unrealized losses of approximately $15.9 million and gains of approximately $1.5 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007, respectively.

If
our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such
inaccuracy.

We
do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not
experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.

Equity Risk.

Our strategic investment portfolio as of October 31, 2008 consists of approximately $14.3 million of minority equity investments in
publicly traded and privately held companies compared to approximately $13.6 million as of October 31, 2007. The securities of publicly traded companies are classified as
available-for-sale securities accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities,

and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in
stockholders' equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value.
During fiscal 2008 and 2006, we reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We did not reduce the value of our strategic
investment portfolio during fiscal 2007. None of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes.



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Synopsys, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended October 31, 2008. We also have audited Synopsys, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Synopsys, Inc.'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A(b). Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
October 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2008, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also



in
our opinion, Synopsys, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As
discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in fiscal 2008 and quantifying errors
in fiscal 2007 resulting from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.

SYNOPSYS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Description of Business

Synopsys, Inc. (Synopsys or the Company) is a world leader in electronic design automation (EDA), supplying the global
electronics market with software, intellectual property (IP) and services used in semiconductor design and manufacturing. The Company delivers technology-leading semiconductor design and verification
platforms and integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing related products to the global electronics market, enabling the development and production of complex systems-on-chips
(SoCs). In addition, the Company provides IP, system-level solutions and design services to simplify the design process and accelerate time-to-market for our customers, and
software and services that help customers prepare and optimize their designs for manufacturing.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year End.

The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest October 31. The Company's current fiscal year ended November 1, 2008. Fiscal
2008 and 2006 were 52-week fiscal years. Fiscal 2007 was a 53-week fiscal year and the additional week was contained in the first quarter. For presentation purposes, the
consolidated financial statements and notes refer to the calendar month end.

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must make assumptions, judgments and
estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The functional currency of each of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency except for the
Company's principal Irish, Hungarian, and Swiss subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are the United States (U.S.) dollar. Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional
currency are remeasured into the functional currency with any related gain or loss recorded in earnings. The Company translates assets and liabilities of its foreign operations, except its principal
Irish, Hungarian and Swiss subsidiaries, into the U.S. dollar reporting currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The Company translates income and expense items of its foreign
operations into U.S. dollars reporting currency at average exchange rates for the period. Accumulated translation adjustments are reported in stockholders' equity, as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss.

Foreign Currency Contracts.

The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company enters
into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and
balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on
previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various
currencies as listed in Note 5. The duration of forward contracts ranges from one month to 19 months. The Company does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or
trading purposes. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and has not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, the Company anticipates
performance by all counterparties to such agreements.



The
Company accounts for the foreign currency forward contracts under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

. The assets or liabilities associated with the forward contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the foreign currency forward contract and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge
accounting

Cash
Flow Hedging Activities

Certain
foreign exchange forward contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are
formally documented at inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. The effective portion of gains or losses
resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and reclassified into revenue
or operating expenses, as appropriate, at the time the forecasted transactions affect earnings. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future
cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately three years. The duration of the forward contracts is generally approximately one year or less, except for forward contracts denominated in
Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, India Rupee and Taiwan dollar, which can have durations as long as 19 months.

Hedging
effectiveness is evaluated monthly using spot rates, with any gain or loss caused by hedging ineffectiveness reclassified to earnings as other income (expense). The
premium/discount component of
the forward contracts is recorded to other income (expense) and is not included in evaluating hedging effectiveness. See Note 5.

Balance
Sheet Hedging Activities

The
Company's foreign exchange forward contracts related to non-functional-currency denominated balance sheet assets and liabilities are not designated as hedging instruments
under SFAS No. 133. Accordingly, any gains or losses from changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are reported in other income. The gains and losses on these forward contracts
generally offset the gains and losses associated with the underlying assets and liabilities, which are also reported in Other (Loss) Income, Net. The duration of the forward contracts is approximately
one month.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments.

The fair value of the Company's cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and foreign
currency contracts, approximates the carrying amount due to their short duration. Long-term marketable equity investments are valued based on quoted market prices.
Non-marketable equity securities are valued at cost. The Company performs periodic impairment analysis over these non-marketable equity securities.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.

The Company classifies investments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired as cash
equivalents. All of the Company's short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
included in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Those unrealized gains or losses deemed other than temporary are reflected in Other
(Loss) Income, Net. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in Other (Loss) Income, Net. The Company has cash equivalents
and investments with various high quality institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

The Company sells its products worldwide primarily to customers in the global electronics market. The Company performs
on-going credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and does not require collateral. The Company establishes reserves for potential



credit
losses and such losses have been within management's expectations and have not been material in any year presented.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for
doubtful accounts to reduce the Company's receivables to their estimated net realizable value. The Company provides a general reserve on all accounts receivable based on a review of accounts and a 15
quarter average of write-offs, net of recoveries. The following table presents the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109). Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

The
Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

(FIN 48) and FASB Staff Position No. 48-1 (FSP FIN 48-1) in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The interpretation
contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is
to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 48-1 which amended
FIN 48 to provide guidance about how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. Under FSP
FIN 48-1, a tax position could be effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.

Upon
adoption of FIN 48 and FSP FIN 48-1, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle by recognizing a decrease in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $5.0 million, with a corresponding increase to beginning retained earnings. The Company also recognized an additional decrease in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits related to employee stock options of $9.7 million of which $7.7 million increased beginning paid-in capital with the remaining $2.0 million
off-setting existing deferred tax assets. The Company had historically recorded its unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its current accrued income taxes payable. FIN 48
requires liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits to be classified based on whether it is expected payment will be made within the next 12 months. Amounts expected to be paid within the next



12 months
are classified as current liabilities and all other amounts are classified as non-current liabilities or are offset against a directly related deferred tax asset or income
tax receivable. In addition, the Company had historically recorded state, local and interest liabilities net of the estimated benefit which is expected to be received from deducting such payments on
future tax returns (i.e., on a "net" basis). FIN 48 requires this estimated benefit to be classified as a deferred tax asset instead of a reduction of the overall liability
(i.e., on a "gross" basis).

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets, excluding land, are depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the lease
or the economic useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Depreciation was $49.9 million, $51.0 million and $55.0 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to operations as incurred and was $17.7 million, $16.8 million and $16.4 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
Company evaluates the recoverability of its property, equipment and intangible assets whenever indicators of impairment exist in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(SFAS 144), and records an impairment charge against income as appropriate. A detail of property and
equipment is as follows:

The

Leasehold improvements (average)


During
fiscal 2007, the Company entered into a formal plan to sell its two buildings and a parcel of land in Hillsboro, Oregon and lease-back a portion of one of the
buildings. An amount
of $18.1 million, representing the carrying value of the other building and the parcel of land, had been reclassified from property and equipment, net, to asset
held-for-sale in prepaid and other current assets at that time. The sales transaction entered into during fiscal 2008 was cancelled by the prospective buyer. As of
October 31, 2008, the Company intends to retain these two buildings and the parcel of land and therefore has reclassified the carrying value back to property and equipment in accordance with
requirements of SFAS 144.

Software Development Costs.

Capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which is generally the
completion of a working prototype and ends upon general release of the product. Capitalized software development costs were $3.0 million,



$2.3 million
and $3.5 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Amortization of software development costs is computed based on the straight-line method over the
estimated economic life of approximately two years. The Company recorded amortization costs of $2.9 million, $2.9 million and $3.0 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired by the Company. The goodwill recorded as a result of the business combinations in the years presented is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is not amortized. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(SFAS 142), the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more
frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review. The Company determined that it is a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment tests under SFAS 142. For purposes of
assessing the impairment of goodwill, the Company estimates the value of the reporting unit using its market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value. This fair value is then compared to the
carrying value of the reporting unit. In addition, the carrying value of goodwill may be affected by the settlement of tax contingencies or the recognition of tax benefits from acquired companies in
periods subsequent to the acquisition date. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were no indicators of impairments to goodwill. As of October 31, 2008, the carrying amount of goodwill was
$899.6 million.

Intangible
assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer installed base/relationships, trademarks and tradenames, covenants not to compete, customer
backlog, capitalized software and other intangibles. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from two to ten years.
Amortization of intangible assets was $47.0 million, $53.0 million and $59.4 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company
continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of the long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such
events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through
the undiscounted expected future cash flow. If the future undiscounted
cash flow is less than the carrying amount of these assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. The Company did not
recognize intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. As of October 31, 2008, the carrying amount of the Company's intangible assets was $114.8 million.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and service revenue. Software license revenue consists of fees
associated with the licensing of its software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees.

The
Company has designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue
Recognition,

as amended and EITF 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

.

With
respect to software licenses, the Company utilizes three license types:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

are time-based
licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. The Company bundles
and does not charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license.

•

Term Licenses

are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer
any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the
term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

•

Perpetual Licenses

continue as long as the customer renews maintenance
plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase
maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually.

For
the three software license types, the Company recognizes revenue as follows:

•

TSLs.

The Company typically recognizes revenue from TSL
fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported
as "time-based license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations.

•

Term Licenses.

The Company recognizes revenue from term
licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are
met. Revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as "upfront license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee is
due within one year from shipment, the Company recognizes revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as "time-based license revenue" in the
consolidated statement of operations.

•

Perpetual Licenses.

The Company recognizes revenue from
perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the



perpetual
license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as "upfront license revenue" in the
consolidated statement of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment, the Company recognizes the revenue as customer
installments become due and payable. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as "time-based license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations.

The
Company generally recognizes revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. If a technology subscription license is incorporated
into the hardware, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the term of the software license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to
these hardware sales is reported as "upfront license revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations.

In
addition, the Company recognizes revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received and recognizes revenue from professional
service and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as "maintenance and service
revenue" in the consolidated statement of operations.

The
Company's determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). The Company limits its assessment of
VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately.

The
Company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple-element software arrangements and has determined that it has sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance
components of its perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, the Company recognize license revenue from
perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, the Company recognizes revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and it recognizes revenue from professional
services as milestones are performed and accepted. The Company recognizes revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there
is not sufficient VSOE to allocate the TSL fee between license and maintenance services.

The
Company makes significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, the Company must evaluate whether:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and
(4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for the Company to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement.
The Company applies these revenue recognition criteria as follows:

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.

Prior to
recognizing revenue on an arrangement, the Company's customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and the Company or a purchase order from those customers that have
previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement.

•

Delivery Has Occurred.

The Company delivers its products
to its customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when the Company provides access to customers to take immediate possession of the software by downloading it
to the customer's hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. The Company generally ships its products or license keys promptly after acceptance of
customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a



result,
timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a quarter.

•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable.

The Company's
determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement's payment terms. The Company's standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75%
or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, the Company regards the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognizes all license revenue under the
arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, the Company does not consider the fee to be fixed or
determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology
and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when the customer's installments become
due and payable, even if the fee is otherwise fixed or determinable.

•

Collectability is Probable.

The Company judges
collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. The Company typically sells to customers with whom it has a history
of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to the Company, the Company evaluates the customer's financial position and ability to
pay and typically assigns a credit limit based on that review. The Company increases the credit limit only after the Company has established a successful collection history with the customer. If it
determines at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer's payment history, the Company recognizes revenue under
that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share.

In accordance with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per Share

(SFAS 128), the
Company computes basic income per share by dividing net income available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the dilution from potential common shares outstanding such as stock options and
unvested restricted stock units and awards during the period using the treasury stock method.

The
table below reconciles the weighted-average common shares used to calculate basic net income per share with the weighted-average common shares used to calculate diluted net income
per share.

for the respective periods, they could be dilutive in the future.

Share-Based Compensation.

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
Payment

(SFAS 123(R)) in the beginning of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123(R) requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards including stock
options, employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans, non-vested share awards and stock appreciation rights on the date of the grant. The value of awards expected to vest
is recognized as expense over the applicable service periods. The Company recorded $65.5 million, $62.0 million and $63.0 million of share-based compensation expense for fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 8.

Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncement.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects
of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

, (SAB 108).
SAB 108
addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying misstatements and provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current
year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement
(rollover) approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. The transition
provisions of SAB 108 allowed a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment to retained earnings for immaterial errors related to years prior to adoption. The Company adopted
SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company recorded an adjustment to its opening fiscal 2007 retained earnings balance in the amount of $14.9 million in accordance with
the implementation guidance in SAB 108. The adjustment resulted from an understatement of share-based compensation and an overstatement of depreciation expense in prior years both of which were
immaterial to prior fiscal years under the rollover method. The total cumulative impact to retained earnings is as follows:

Warranties and Indemnities.

The Company generally warrants its products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications
for a period of 90 days for software products and for up to one year for hardware products. The Company also typically provides its
customer limited indemnification with respect to claims that their use of the Company's design and verification software products infringe on United States patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade
secrets. The Company is currently defending some of its customers against claims that their use of one of its products infringes a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. The Company is unable
to estimate the potential impact of these guarantees on the future results of operations. To date, the Company has not been required to pay any material warranty claims.

Note 3. Business Combinations

During the fiscal years presented, the Company made a number of purchase acquisitions. For each acquisition, the excess of the purchase
price over the estimated value of the net tangible assets acquired



was
allocated to various intangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technology, customer and contract-related assets and goodwill. The values assigned to developed technologies related to
each acquisition were based upon future discounted cash flows related to the existing products' projected income streams. Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair
value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions, is not amortized. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes, with the exception of the MOSAID
Technologies, Inc. acquisition discussed below. The amounts allocated to purchased in-process research and developments were determined through established valuation techniques in
the high-technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed.

The
consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. The Company does not consider these acquisitions to be material to its
results of operations and is therefore not presenting pro forma statements of operations for fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Fiscal 2008 Acquisition

On May 15, 2008, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Synplicity, Inc. (Synplicity). Synplicity was a leading
supplier of innovative field programmable gate array (FPGA) and IC design and verification solutions that served a wide range of communications, military/aerospace, semiconductor, consumer, computer,
and other electronic applications markets. The Company believes the acquisition will expand its technology portfolio, channel reach and total
addressable market by adding complementary products and expertise for FPGA solutions and rapid ASIC prototyping.

Purchase Price.

Synopsys paid $8.00 per share for all outstanding shares including certain vested options of Synplicity for an aggregate cash payment of
$223.3 million. Additionally, Synopsys assumed certain employee stock options and restricted stock units, collectively called "stock awards." The total purchase consideration consisted of:

194,269

Estimated
acquisition related costs of $9.5 million consist primarily of professional services, severance and employee related costs and facilities closure costs of which
$5.3 million have been paid as of October 31, 2008.

Fair Value of Stock Awards Assumed.

An aggregate of 4.7 million shares of Synplicity stock options and restricted stock units were exchanged for Synopsys
stock options and restricted stock units at an exchange ratio of 0.3392 per share. The fair value of stock options assumed was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of stock
awards vested or earned of $4.2 million was included as part of the purchase price. The fair value of unvested awards of $5.0 million will be recorded as operating expense over the
remaining service periods on a straight-line basis.

Purchase Price Allocation.

The Company allocated $119.9 million of the purchase price to goodwill, $80.0 million to identifiable intangible assets to
be amortized over 2-7 years, $4.8 million to in-process research and development, and $72.4 million to remaining tangible assets, offset by
$40.2 million of assumed liabilities. The Company has not yet finalized certain acquisition related costs and tax allocations.



Goodwill,
representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, was $119.9 million and will not be amortized
and is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill primarily resulted from the Company's expectation of cost synergies and sales growth from the integration of Synplicity's technology with the Company's
technology and operations to provide an expansion of products and market reach.

pay up to $4.0 million over three years to the former stockholders based upon achievement of certain product and sales milestones. This contingent consideration is considered to be additional
purchase price and an adjustment to goodwill when and if payment is made. During fiscal 2008, $0.4 million of contingent consideration was earned and paid. Additionally, $1.2 million was
earned in October 31, 2008 and subsequently paid.

As
of October 31, 2008, the stated maturities of the Company's short-term investments are $99.3 million within one year, $93.4 million within one to five
years, $41.1 million within five to ten years and $139.8 million after ten years. Actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or
prepay certain obligations. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses,
net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Realized gains and losses on sales of short-term investments have not been material in
any period presented.



Strategic Investments.

The Company's strategic investment portfolio consists of minority equity investments in publicly traded companies and investments in
privately held companies. The securities of publicly traded companies are classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under SFAS No. 115 (SFAS 115),

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

, and are reported in long-term other assets at fair value, with unrealized
gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders' equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method. Securities of privately held companies are reported at cost net of impairment losses. As of October 31, 2008, the carrying value of the Company's strategic investments
was $14.3 million.

During
fiscal 2008 and 2006, the Company determined that certain strategic investments with aggregate carrying values of $5.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, were
impaired and that these impairments were other than temporary. Accordingly, the Company recorded charges of approximately $1.1 million and $1.3 million during fiscal 2008 and 2006,
respectively, to write down the carrying values of these investments. The Company did not recognize any impairment during fiscal 2007.

Foreign Currency Contracts.

The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
enters into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions
and balance sheet positions. These foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and are denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts
ranges from one month to 19 months. As of October 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had, in notional amounts, $437.1 million and $207.7 million, respectively, of
short-term foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.

The
components of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as cash flow hedges, with gains and losses recorded in stockholders'
equity and reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted transactions affect earnings. As of October 31, 2008 and 2007, unrealized losses of approximately $15.9 million and
unrealized gain of approximately $1.5 million, respectively, are recorded in stockholders' equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. As of
October 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $17.7 million of loss and $1.6 million of gain, respectively, were scheduled to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income into earnings within the following 12 months.

Credit Facility.

On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into a five-year, $300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility
providing for loans to the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional $150.0 million through the fourth year of the
facility. The facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The
facility terminates on October 20, 2011. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at



the
greater of the administrative agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, the Company has the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at Eurodollar rates plus
a spread between 0.50% and 0.70% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.125% and 0.175% per year based on a
pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. As of October 31, 2008, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and was in compliance with all the covenants.

Note 6.    Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain of its domestic and foreign facilities and certain office equipment under non-cancelable lease
agreements. The facilities generally require the Company to pay property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repair costs. Rent expense was $44.6 million, $42.5 million and
$38.6 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company has the option to extend or renew most of its leases. The Company receives sublease payments which are recorded as a
reduction of rent expense.

Future
minimum lease payments on all non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year, net of lease income, as of October 31, 2008 are as

Legal Proceedings

See the disclosure in Note 9 regarding the IRS Revenue Agent's Report.

Other Proceedings.

The Company is also subject to other routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal
course of its business. The ultimate outcome
of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

Note 7.    Stockholders' Equity

Stock Repurchase Programs.

The Company is authorized to purchase up to $500.0 million of its common stock under a stock repurchase program originally
established by the Company's Board of Directors (Board) in December 2004 and replenished to $500.0 million in March 2007. The Company repurchases shares to offset dilution caused by ongoing
stock issuances such as existing employee stock option plans, existing stock purchase plans and acquisitions and, also when management believes it is a good use of cash. Repurchases are transacted in
accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) through open market purchases, under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, and
structured transactions.



During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company purchased 9.6 million shares at an average price of $22.83 per share, 5.7 million shares at an
average price of $26.54 per share, and 10.0 million shares at an average price of $19.94 per share, respectively. The aggregate purchase prices were $220.1 million,
$151.6 million, and $200.0 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, 5.0 million, 11.5 million and 4.7 million shares
were reissued, respectively, for employee stock option exercises, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan requirements. As of October 31, 2008, $209.7 million remained
available for further purchases under the program.

Note 8.    Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan and International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the ESPP), employees are
granted the right to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at (1) the beginning of a rolling two-year
offering period or (2) the end of each semi-annual purchase period, subject to a plan limit on the number of shares that may be purchased in a purchase period.

April 21, 2008, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan by
4.0 million. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company issued 2.2 million, 2.1 million, and 2.4 million shares, respectively, under the ESPP at average per share
prices of $16.29, $16.03 and $13.73, respectively. As of October 31, 2008, 5.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.

Stock Option Plans

2006 Employee Equity Incentive Plan.

On April 25, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the 2006 Employee Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Employee
Plan), which provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights and other
forms of equity compensation, including performance stock awards and performance cash awards, as determined by the plan administrator. The terms and conditions of each type of award are set forth in
the 2006 Employee Plan. Options granted under this plan will have a contractual term of seven years. As of October 31, 2008, an aggregate of 26.7 million stock options, and
2.6 million restricted stock units were outstanding under this plan, and 4.3 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2006 Employee Plan.

As
a result of the stockholders' approval of the 2006 Employee Plan, the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan, 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan and 2005 Assumed Stock Option
Plan (collectively, the Prior Plans) have been terminated for future grants. Should any options currently outstanding under such plans and plans assumed by the Company in acquisitions prior to fiscal
2006 (22.3 million as of October 31, 2008) cancel or expire unexercised they shall become available for future grant under the 2006 Employee Plan.

2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan.

On May 23, 2005, the Company's stockholders approved the 2005 Non-Employee
Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the 2005 Directors Plan) and the reservation of 0.3 million shares of common stock for issuance there under. The 2005 Directors Plan provides for annual equity
awards to non-employee directors in the form of either stock options or restricted stock. Stockholders approved a 0.5 million share increase in the number of shares reserved for
issuance under the 2005 Directors Plan on April 25, 2006.

As
of October 31, 2008, the Company has issued an aggregate of 138,550 shares of restricted stock under the plan with an aggregate value of approximately $3.0 million which
vest over a period of three years. In addition, the Company granted 81,502 of stock options, which vest over a period of three to



four
years, with an aggregate fair value of $2.2 million to non-employee directors during fiscal 2007. As of October 31, 2008, 47,979 shares of restricted stock and 81,502
shares of stock options were outstanding. As of October 31, 2008, a total of 536,830 shares of common stock were reserved for future grant under the 2005 Directors Plan.

1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan.

An aggregate of 843,330 stock options remained outstanding under the Company's 1994
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan as of October 31, 2008, which expired as to future grants in October 2004.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units Assumed in Fiscal 2008.

The Company reserved an additional 1.6 million shares of common stock to be issued upon
exercise or vesting of stock awards under the Synplicity 2000 Stock Plan and 1995 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the Synplicity Plans) which were assumed on May 15, 2008 in connection with
the acquisition of Synplicity. Should any of these shares cancel or expire unexercised, they shall no longer become available for future grant. As of October 31, 2008, 1.2 million shares
remained outstanding under the Synplicity Plans.

Restricted Stock Units.

Since fiscal 2007, restricted stock units are granted as part of the Company's new hire and annual incentive compensation program.
Restricted stock units are valued based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. In general, for non-executive officers, restricted stock units vest over three
to four years and are subject to the employees' continuing
service to the Company. Each restricted stock unit grant reduces the number of shares available for future grants by 1.36 shares and each restricted stock unit cancellation increases shares available
for future grants by 1.36 shares under the 2006 Employee Plan. Restricted Stock activities under the 2006 Employee Plan is as follows:

Valuation and Expense of Share-based Compensation.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and
employee stock purchase plans awards under SFAS 123(R). The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and
interest rates. The expected volatility for both stock options and stock purchase rights under the ESPP is estimated by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of the Company's
common stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of the Company's share-based awards. The expected term of the Company's
share-based awards is based on historical experience.



The
assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted under the Company's stock option plans and stock purchase rights granted under the ESPP are as follows:

Under
SFAS 123(R), the Company uses the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the service period of the award.

As
of October 31, 2008, $72.7 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.3 years.

The
Company included all tax benefits for deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in its statement of cash flows prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for those options (excess tax benefits)
to be classified as cash flows from financing activities. To calculate the excess tax benefits available for use in offsetting future tax shortfalls as of the date of implementation, the Company
follows the alternative transition method discussed in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. 123(R)-3. There was no material impact to the Company's
financial statements upon adoption of the alternative transition
method in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company has not recorded any excess tax benefits during fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Deferred Compensation Plan.

The Company maintains the Synopsys Deferred Compensation Plan (the Deferred Plan), which permits eligible employees to defer up to 50%
of their annual cash base compensation and up to 100% of their eligible cash variable compensation. Distributions from the



Deferred
Plan are generally payable upon termination of employment over 5 to 15 years or as a lump sum payment at the option of the employee. Since the inception of the Deferred Plan, the
Company has not made any matching or discretionary contributions to the Deferred Plan. There are no Deferred Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on investments.
Undistributed amounts under the Deferred Plan are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. These securities, held by the Deferred Plan, are classified as trading securities in accordance with
SFAS 115.

As
of October 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value amounts under the Deferred Plan totaled to $60.7 million and $74.4 million, respectively, and are recorded in
"Long-term other assets" in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of October 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company has recorded $60.9 million and $78.8 million,
respectively, in "Deferred compensation and other liabilities" to recognize undistributed deferred compensation due to employees (obligations). Income or loss from the change in fair value in the
undistributed Deferred Plan is recorded in other income, net. The increase or decrease in the fair value of the undistributed Deferred Plan obligation is recorded in total cost of revenue and
operating expense in accordance with EITF 97-14

Synopsys 401(k) and Other Retirement Plans.

The Company sponsors various retirement plans for its eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total
contributions to these plans are charged to operations and were $15.1 million, $12.0 million and $10.1 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For employees in the
U.S., the Company maintains the Synopsys 401(k) Savings and Success Sharing Plan (the 401k Plan). As allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 401k Plan allows tax deferred
salary deductions of 1% to 30% of eligible annual salary by eligible
employees. Employee contributions are limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches pretax employee contributions up to 40% of employee deferrals or a
maximum of $1,500 per participant per year. Participants who meet the age requirement before the close of the 401k Plan year may be eligible to make catch-up salary deferral contributions,
limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. Catch-up contributions are not eligible for matching contributions.

There
are approximately $8.3 million and $2.1 million of deferred tax liabilities that are included in "Deferred compensation and other liabilities" on the consolidated
balance sheet as of October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The
valuation allowance increased by $16.5 million principally due to deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits, the tax benefit of which is not considered more likely
than not to be realized in future years.

The
Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $50.4 million as of October 31, 2008, primarily from acquired companies which will expire between
fiscal 2018 and 2027.

The
Company has unrecognized deferred tax assets of approximately $16.7 million as of October 31, 2008 attributable to excess tax deductions related to stock options, the
benefit of which will be credited to equity when realized.

The
Company has federal foreign tax credits of $70.1 million of which $63.9 million will expire from fiscal 2013 through 2018 and the remaining $6.2 million in
foreign tax credits from acquired companies, which have a valuation allowance of $3.4 million, will expire between fiscal 2009 and 2017. Foreign tax credits can only be carried forward ten
years, and may only be used after foreign tax credits arising in each subsequent year have been used first. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign
source income during the carryforward period. In addition, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $19.7 million during the fiscal year with respect to our foreign tax credit
carryforward, of which $14.6 million was recorded as a result of the 2000-2001 final IRS settlement. See

IRS Examinations,

below.
Based on available evidence, it is more likely than



not
that the Company can utilize the remaining foreign tax credit carryforwards. The need for a valuation allowance with respect to foreign tax credits is subject to change based upon a number of
factors, including the amount of foreign tax credits arising in future years, our forecasts of future foreign source income, the amount of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and
changes in income tax laws that may affect our ability to use such credits.

The
Company has federal research and development credits of $48.0 million, of which $31.0 million will expire between fiscal 2022 and 2028 and $17.0 million from
acquired companies will expire between fiscal 2009 and 2027.

The
Company has a deferred tax asset of $24.5 million relating to California research and development tax credit carryforwards, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The
Company has also recorded a deferred tax asset of $8.0 million relating to other state tax attributes carried forward for which the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of
$3.8 million.

The
Company has a net deferred tax asset of $7.5 million relating to excess capital loss carryforwards for which the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of
$1.7 million. Our ability to utilize capital loss carryforwards is dependent upon having sufficient capital gain net income during the carryback and carryforward periods. Based on available
evidence, it is more likely than not that the Company can utilize the remaining capital losses which will expire in fiscal 2010 through 2012.

In
evaluating its ability to utilize its deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results, the existence of
cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions in the most recent fiscal years and its forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2008, the Company
believes that except where a valuation allowance has been provided, it is more likely than not that forecasted income; including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning
strategies will be sufficient to fully recover the net deferred tax assets.

In
fiscal 2006, the Company reduced additional paid in capital by approximately $8.9 million. The decrease is primarily due to the withdrawal of an incorrect state refund claim
made in 2005 relating to stock option deductions claimed for foreign employees and an overstatement in prior years of the excess tax benefit realized from exercises of stock options assumed in certain
acquisitions. In fiscal 2007, the Company recorded an increase in additional paid in capital by approximately $1.3 million related to a tax benefit for prior year stock option exercises by
certain non-U.S. employees.

The
Company has not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the Company plans to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the United States. If
the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount the Company intends to reinvest in foreign countries in the future, the Company would provide for taxes on such excess amount. As of
October 31, 2008, there was approximately $243.0 million of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. In May 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act
of 2005 (the 2005 Act) was enacted and provides a three-year exception to current U.S. taxation of certain foreign intercompany income. The provisions of the 2005 Act first applied to the
Company for fiscal 2007.

In
October 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the 2008 Act) was enacted, which extended the three-year exception to current U.S. taxation of such
intercompany income by one additional year to fiscal year 2010. The 2008 Act also retroactively extended the research and development credit from January 1, 2008 through December 31,
2009.

The
gross unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated balance sheet as of November 1, 2007 were $207.3 million. The gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by
approximately $9.4 million during fiscal 2008, resulting in gross unrecognized tax benefits of $216.7 million as of October 31, 2008.



A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows (in millions):

As
of October 31, 2008, approximately $111 million of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate ($125 million as of November 1, 2007),
if recognized upon resolution of the uncertain tax positions.

Interest
and penalties related to estimated obligations for tax positions taken in the Company's tax returns are recognized as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated
statements of operations. As of November 1, 2007, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on the Company's tax returns was approximately
$10.3 million. The accrued interest and penalties decreased by approximately $3.9 million during the fiscal year, primarily due to the 2000-2001 IRS settlement (see

IRS Examinations

, below).
Prior to the adoption of FIN 48 in fiscal 2008, the estimated liability for unrecognized tax benefits was presented as
a current liability.

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S., including various state and local jurisdictions. Its subsidiaries file tax returns in various foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland,
Hungary, Taiwan and Japan. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations in the U.S. for fiscal years after 1999, in Hungary and Taiwan for fiscal years after 2005, in Ireland for fiscal
years after 2003 and in Japan for fiscal years after 2004. See

IRS Examinations

, below for the status of our current federal income tax audits.

The
timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as well as the amounts and timing of various tax payments that are part of the settlement process. This could
cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. The Company believes that before the end of fiscal 2009, it is reasonably
possible that the statute of limitations on certain state and foreign income and withholding taxes will expire. Given the uncertainty as to ultimate settlement terms, the timing of payment and the
impact of such settlements on other uncertain tax positions, the range of the estimated potential decrease in underlying unrecognized tax benefits is between $0 and $18 million.

IRS Examinations

The Company is regularly audited by the IRS.

On
June 8, 2005, the Company received a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) in which the IRS proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately
$476.8 million, plus interest. This proposed adjustment primarily related to transfer pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly owned foreign subsidiary. On July 13, 2005, the
Company filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the matter to be referred to the Appeals Office of the IRS. On June 30, 2008, the IRS and the Company executed a
final Closing Agreement pursuant to



which
substantially all of the proposed assessment was eliminated. As a result of the final resolution of the transfer pricing issue, the Company decreased its FIN 48 liabilities by
$41.0 million in the third quarter of 2008, including interest accrued of $2.8 million and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital of $0.3 million. Concurrently, the
Company evaluated its ability to use certain foreign tax credit carryovers which have been recorded as noncurrent deferred tax assets in its balance sheet, a portion of which may have been available
to offset the FIN 48 liability. As a result of the final resolution of the transfer pricing issue, the Company concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that $14.6 million of
its foreign tax credits will be used prior to the expiration of the carryover period, and recorded a valuation allowance for this amount. Accordingly, the Company's provision for income taxes includes
a net income tax benefit (net of decreases in related deferred tax assets) of $17.3 million as a result of the 2000-2001 IRS settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the statute
of
limitations remains open with respect to fiscal years 2000-2001 for two related issues until the Appeals Office has considered certain refund claims relevant to these years which are
affected by the fiscal year 2002-2004 federal income tax audit. The Company has accrued the tax for these issues in accordance with the tentative settlement the Company reached with the
IRS in December 2007.

In
the third quarter of 2006, the IRS started an examination of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2004. In July 2008, the IRS completed its field
examination of these returns and issued an RAR in which the IRS proposed an adjustment that would result in an aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period of approximately
$236.2 million, $130.5 million of which would be a reduction of certain tax losses and credits that would otherwise be available either as refund claims or to offset taxes due in future
periods. The IRS is contesting the Company's tax deduction for payments made in connection with litigation between Avant! Corporation and Cadence Design Systems, Inc. In addition, the IRS has
asserted that the Company is required to make an additional transfer pricing adjustment with a wholly owned non-U.S. subsidiary as a result of the Company's acquisition of Avant! in 2002.
The IRS has also proposed adjustments to the Company's transfer pricing arrangements with its foreign subsidiaries, deductions for foreign trade income and certain temporary differences. The Company
has agreed to additional taxes of approximately $20.0 million for these proposed adjustments, which have been fully provided for in prior years. The total adjustments proposed by the IRS, if
sustained, would also result in additional state taxes (net of the federal tax benefit for state taxes paid) of approximately $17 million. The IRS imposes interest on any resulting tax
deficiencies. On August 9, 2008, the Company timely filed a protest with the IRS and will seek resolution of these issues through the Appeals Office. The Company strongly believes the proposed
IRS adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that the Company has meritorious defenses to this proposed IRS adjustment. The RAR is not a final
Statutory Notice of Deficiency. The Company believes it has adequately provided for potential tax liabilities related to these years. Final resolution of these matters is expected to take several
years.

Note 11.    Segment Disclosure

SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information

, (SFAS 131) requires disclosures of certain information regarding operating segments, products and services, geographic areas of operation and major
customers. SFAS 131 reporting is based upon the "management approach," i.e., how management organizes the Company's operating segments for which separate financial information is
(1) available and (2) evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Synopsys' CODMs are the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.

The
Company provides software products and consulting services in the electronic design automation software industry. The Company operates in a single segment. In making operating
decisions, the CODMs primarily consider consolidated financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region. Specifically, the CODMs consider
where individual "seats" or licenses to the Company's products are used in allocating revenue to particular geographic areas. Revenue is defined as revenues from external customers. Goodwill is not



allocated
since the Company operates in one reportable operating segment. Revenues and property and equipment, net, related to operations in the United States and other by geographic areas were:

Note 12. Related Party and Other Transactions

Former Director Richard Newton provided consulting services to the Company for which he was paid $16,667 and $180,000 for the fiscal
2007 and 2006 respectively. Dr. Newton passed away on January 1, 2007. Under the Company's agreement with Dr. Newton, Dr. Newton provided advice concerning
long-term technology strategy and industry development issues as well as assistance in identifying opportunities for partnerships with academia. Dr. Newton was a Professor of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.

Note 13.    Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157). The purpose of SFAS 157 is to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring
fair value and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets
and liabilities, and November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The measurement and disclosure requirements are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal 2009. While the Company is currently evaluating whether SFAS 157 will result in a change to its fair value measurements, it does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 161).
SFAS 161 requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information on how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and how derivative



instruments
and related hedged items affect a company's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value measurement to report all financial instruments at fair value. Its objective is
to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to use fair value measurement for
financial instruments in periods subsequent to adoption without using the complex hedging-accounting provisions. Under SFAS 159, entities may measure specified financial instruments at fair
value on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting period. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. The requirements are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to
have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R
significantly changes accounting for business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The requirements are effective for the
Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and will generally affect acquisitions occurring after the effective date. However, the change with respect to income tax adjustments will also
apply to acquisitions completed prior to the effective date. Adjustments to acquired income tax liabilities and valuation allowances with respect to acquired deferred tax assets subsequent to the
acquisition date will be recognized in income from continuing operations, with certain exceptions, rather than through a change to goodwill, as existing rules allow, if such changes occur after the
measurement period. The Company has not yet determined the impact that SFAS 141R may have on its consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(SFAS 160).
SFAS 160 requires the noncontrolling interests (minority interests) to be recorded at fair value and reported as a component of equity. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
on or after December 15, 2008. The requirements are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have
a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of October 31, 2008, Synopsys
carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Synopsys' management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of Synopsys' disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). There are
inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute,
assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2008, (1) Synopsys' disclosure controls
and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and (2) Synopsys' disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in the reports Synopsys files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to Synopsys' management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding its required disclosure.

(b)

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

.    Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for Synopsys.



Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2008. In making this assessment, our management used the framework established in

Internal Control Integrated
Framework

issued by The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Our
management has concluded that, as of October 31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting
firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an auditors' report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

(c)

Changes in Internal Controls.

There were no changes in Synopsys' internal control over
financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Synopsys' internal control over financial
reporting.
