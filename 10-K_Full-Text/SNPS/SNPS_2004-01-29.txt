Exchange Commission.

The Role of EDA in the Electronics Industry

Continuing technology advances in the semiconductor
industry have dramatically increased the feature density, speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors (also referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips).

•

Since the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires imprinted on the chip that form the transistors) and other developments have enabled IC
manufacturers to approximately double every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip. As a result, state-of-the-art ICs now hold tens of millions of transistors and have feature widths of 130 nanometers (billionths of an
inch), going to 90 nanometers and below.

•

Microprocessors operating at more than 3 gigahertz, a speed unheard of only a few years ago, are readily available today.



•

Chips have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants.

•

Increasingly, single SoCs can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board.

Combined, these advances in semiconductor technology have driven development
of lower cost, higher performance computers, wireless communications networks, cell phones, hand-held personal devices, Internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new challenges for all
participants in semiconductor production, including designers, manufacturers, equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers.

The IC Design Process

EDA software is central to the IC design process, as it enables designers to:

•

Address ever-increasing complexity by moving to less detailed, higher-level design representations of the chip’s intended functionality;

•

Translate these high-level representations automatically into successively more detailed forms, from symbolic, front-end system and logic designs to geometric, back-end physical
layout designs; and

•

Verify at each stage in the design process that the chip’s design is sound and that the chip when manufactured will function as originally intended.

In simplified form, IC design consists of system design, logic design,
functional verification, physical design and physical verification.

System Design.

In system design, the designer describes the chip’s desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized high-level computer language, typically Verilog or VHDL. This phase yields a
relatively high-level, “register transfer level” (RTL) description of the chip. System design is an early stage market segment for EDA companies, as most EDA products have focused to date on logic design, functional verification and
physical design and verification.

Logic
Design.

Logic design, or “synthesis,” programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a data file known as a “net list” describing the various groups of transistors, or
“gates,” to be built on the chip. Related programs insert into the design the additional circuitry that will be needed to test the chip after manufacture.

In a growing number of designs, logic synthesis is performed together with a portion of physical design. This combined
process, known as “physical synthesis,” produces a data file describing the chip plus a portion of the chip’s physical layout. Also, in a growing number of SoCs, designers are increasingly performing “design planning” in
which the designer determines the location of the major functional “blocks” on the SoC prior to logic synthesis.

Functional Verification.

Before and after logic design, the designer uses testbench automation and other verification tools
to simulate large sets of inputs that a given IC design might confront in real-life operation. By running these extensive tests, the designer can verify that the design will function as intended.

Physical Design.

In the physical design stage,
the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with a “place and route” tool. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the
location for each transistor within each block, a process known as “placement.” Then the designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as “routing.” The output of place and route programs is one or more
data files that can be read by physical verification programs (as described below) or by the equipment used to manufacture the chip.



Physical Verification.

Before sending the chip design files to a
manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a series of further verification steps, confirming again that the chip will still operate at the desired speed and checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific
requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip. The designer may need to add features to the design to ensure that the chip can be manufactured successfully. The completion of this final phase is called “tapeout.”

In actual chip design, each of these steps has a number of
additional elements, and designers often undertake the various design and verification steps in a different order than described above, and repeat one or more steps multiple times. Further, several of the steps, especially logic design and physical
design, are becoming more integrated with each other. If at any stage of the process the designer determines the chip design will not perform as intended, the designer must go back one or more steps and correct the problem, then continue through
subsequent steps. Recreating a chip’s logic design, devising and performing simulation over again, and other iterations all take time. Each such iteration adds significant costs, and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet
time-to-market goals.

Current Issues Facing IC Designers

As chip technology continues to advance, our customers face three principal
types of interrelated challenges:

•

Product Challenges

.    Chips are differentiated on a number of dimensions, including size, speed, functionality, power consumption and performance. The
designer must balance each dimension against the others, making key tradeoff decisions—often through multiple iterations—to reach a final design. As chips become more complex, this balancing of factors becomes disproportionately more
difficult. In the meantime, designers of advanced chips must also successfully address technical issues, including:

•

Timing closure

:  achieving consistency between the speed of the chip after logic design and the speed of the chip after physical design;

•

Signal integrity

:  a general term describing the many electrical effects, like cross-talk and other forms of interference, that occur as the wires on a chip
get more narrow and closer together;

•

Power management

:  reducing power consumption is an important objective for chips to be used in battery-operated devices, such as laptop computers and cell
phones;

•

Verification

:  the number of tests required to verify a chip increases geometrically as the number of transistors increases, to the point that verification
is the single most time-consuming and resource intensive aspect of overall design;

•

Manufacturability

:  due in substantial part to steadily decreasing feature widths and thus increasing feature density, faithfully translating the design
produced by EDA tools into the intricate pattern of wires and transistors on the chip has become significantly more difficult;

•

Design for test

:  ensuring that the chip can be tested rapidly and at a reasonable cost once manufactured, despite substantial increases in the number of
circuits on the chip that need testing;

and

•

Yield

:  ensuring that the chip can be manufactured successfully and at an acceptable number of good chips per wafer.

•

Cost

.    In planning a chip project, our customers must consider design costs, manufacturing costs and support costs, all of which are steadily
increasing. The higher the cost, the higher the expected volume of chips the customer must sell to make a given chip project profitable. Faced with increasing costs, our customers continue to focus intensely on controlling their research and
development and manufacturing costs, including their costs in EDA. As a result, many of our customers have begun consolidating suppliers to improve their purchasing terms and, more importantly, to gain the benefits of better integrated
products.



•

Schedule

.    Economic pressures, competition and continuing innovation continue to shorten the life cycle of electronic products. Accordingly,
time-to-market is critical to a product’s commercial success. The design time for a product’s IC components is a major determining factor of that product’s time-to-market. Accordingly, our customers require EDA products that can
address greater complexity, while increasing design speed and maintaining design reliability.

Synopsys Overview

We
provide products and services that help our customers meet the challenges of designing leading-edge ICs. As a result of our mid-2002 acquisition of Avant! Corporation (Avant!), we now offer a comprehensive suite of system design, logic design,
functional verification, physical design and physical verification products. Our March 2003 acquisition of Numerical Technologies, Inc. (Numerical) expanded our offerings of manufacturing technologies and products geared towards small geometry
designs. We also sell the broadest array of pre-verified intellectual property (IP) components of any company in the EDA industry. Finally, we offer a full range of professional services, including turnkey design services, design assistance and
methodology consulting.

We market our products worldwide and
offer comprehensive customer service, education, consulting and support as integral components of our product offerings. We market our products primarily through our direct sales force. We have licensed our products to most of the world’s
leading semiconductor, computer, communications, electronics and device companies.

Strategy

Our strategy has three principal
components. First, we have historically focused, and will continue to focus, on providing our customers the most technologically advanced products to address each step in the IC design process. Second, building on the strength of our individual
products, we will continue to focus on developing broad, increasingly integrated “platforms,” or collections of key individual products that are tightly integrated through the use of common technologies, to deliver enhanced value. In
fiscal 2003, we created two distinct platforms: our Galaxy Design Platform and our Discovery Verification Platform. Third, we will expand our product offerings in areas offering the potential for rapid growth. For example, we have undertaken
initiatives in both the intellectual property and design for manufacturing segments as described below under

Implementation Group

Galaxy Design
Platform

.    In February 2003, we announced the combination of many of our leading IC design products into a single, unified platform called the Galaxy

™

Design Platform. Galaxy includes the following products:

•

Design Compiler

®

is our market-leading logic synthesis tool used by a broad range of companies engaged in the design of ICs to optimize their designs for
performance and area.

•

Physical Compiler

®

is our physical synthesis product which unites logic synthesis and placement functionality and addresses critical timing problems encountered in
designing advanced ICs and SoCs.

•

Module Compiler

™

allows designers to reuse their datapath structures to obtain the best implementation for their designs.

•

Power Compiler

™

helps designers manage and verify power consumption at different levels of the design process.

•

DFT Compiler

™

inserts functional and test logic required to enable efficient, high-coverage testing of the chip after manufacturing.

•

Jupiter XT

™

is our hierarchical design planning tool that allows designers to quickly partition their chip design into the best physical hierarchy to optimize logic synthesis and physical implementation.

•

Apollo

™

is our basic physical design tool used for the placement and routing of a chip.

•

Astro

™

is our advanced physical design system for optimization, placement and routing while concurrently accounting for physical effects.

•

PrimeTime

®

/PrimeTime SI

are timing analysis products that measure and analyze the speed at which a design will operate when it is fabricated.
PrimeTime SI analyzes the effect of cross-talk on timing, an increasingly important issue at chip geometries below 180 nanometers.

•

Star-RCXT

™

is our industry-leading extraction solution for analyzing IC layout data and determining key electrical characteristics of a chip, such as capacitance and resistance.

•

Hercules

™

is our physical verification product family that performs design-rule checking, electrical rule checking, and layout versus schematic verification.

•

Milkyway

™

Database

is a common design data repository which enables better interoperability among implementation and analysis tools. Storing design data in this single database with rapid read/write access can
reduce data translation times between tools and inconsistent interpretations of diverse data. We opened this database to our customers and other EDA vendors in February 2003 to reduce integration costs for our customers and advance tool
interoperability in the industry.

With the
Galaxy Design Platform, our goal is to provide our customers a single, integrated IC design platform based on leading individual products which incorporates common libraries and consistent timing, delay calculation and constraints throughout the
design process using our open Milkyway database, and yet allows designers the flexibility to integrate internally developed and third-party tools. With this advanced functionality,



common foundation and flexibility, our Galaxy Design Platform should help reduce design times, decrease integration costs and minimize the risks inherent in
advanced, complex IC designs.

Verification Group

Discovery Verification
Platform

.    Also during fiscal 2003, we introduced our Discovery

™

Verification Platform. The Discovery Platform combines many of our verification and nanometer level analysis tools in a unified environment to provide high performance and efficient interaction among these
technologies. The Discovery Verification Platform includes the following products:

•

VCS

®

is our high performance software simulator that serves as the basic engine of the Discovery Verification Platform and is often used in simulation
“farms” consisting of hundreds or thousands of computers. VCS includes technologies that support model development, testbench creation, coverage feedback and debugging techniques.

•

System Studio

is a verification environment which focuses on the interaction between software and hardware and permits designers to model various alternatives for
their chips at a system level.

•

LEDA

is our programmable coding and design guideline checker that enhance a designer’s ability to check a design for synthesizability, simulatability, testability
and reusability.

•

Vera

®

automates the creation of “testbenches,” or custom models that provide simulation inputs and respond to simulated outputs from the design during
verification. Automating this process significantly reduces overall design and verification time. Vera is integrated with our other simulation products to provide increased productivity benefits.

•

Formality

®

is our formal verification solution that compares two versions of a design to determine if they are equivalent. The use of formal verification reduces
the need to perform simulation, which is substantially more time-consuming, thus potentially saving a significant amount of time in the overall design process.

•

Magellan

™

combines functional and formal verification technologies to allow engineers to find deep, corner-case software defects, or “bugs,” quickly during verification.

•

NanoSim

®

is our advanced, transistor level circuit simulation and analysis product for digital, analog and mixed signal verification that offers circuit
simulation, timing and power analysis in a single tool. NanoSim is a key component of Discovery AMS.

•

HSPICE

®

offers high-accuracy, transistor-level circuit simulation enabling designers to better predict the timing, power consumption and functionality of their
designs.

The Discovery Verification Platform
also includes our Discovery AMS platform, a subset of the above technologies tuned to perform verification on analog and mixed analog-and-digital designs, and supports the latest Accellera SystemVerilog language standard, Verilog, VHDL, mixed-HDL,
SystemC, and for analog mixed-signal based methodologies, Verilog-AMS and SPICE.

The increasing size and complexity of today’s ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs, with test creation and verification now consuming up to 70% of the total
design time for a given IC. Our Discovery Platform combines our simulation and verification products and design-for-verification methodologies, and provides a consistent control environment to significantly improve the speed, breadth and accuracy of
our customers’ verification efforts on complex chip designs, increasing their productivity and helping them deliver their products to market faster.

Solutions

Synopsys’ Solutions Group includes our portfolio of IP products and components and our Consulting Services Group.



Intellectual Property Products

.    As IC designs continue to grow in size,
reusing proven design blocks is an increasingly important way to reduce overall design cost and cycle time. Enabling reuse of IP requires a significant methodology shift from traditional IC design. In the past, designs were intimately tied to a
particular semiconductor process technology or design methodology, making reuse of design blocks from one chip design to the next both difficult and costly. More recently, IC companies have been able to increasingly reuse pre-designed and verified
IP components, particularly those that implement basic or standardized functions. The ability to reuse such IP allows IC companies to focus their design teams on designing the chip features that will give its products a competitive advantage. Using
pre-designed IP can also reduce a chip designer’s verification risk by ensuring that the “designed in” portions of the chip are “pre-verified” and thus high quality. Because of the increasing importance of pre-designed IP,
and in order to minimize the risk and effort in acquiring IP from a myriad of smaller suppliers, IC designers are beginning to consolidate their IP purchases from fewer vendors who can provide a reliable, comprehensive portfolio of proven IP.

Our IP products include:

•

DesignWare Foundation Library

is an extensive library of basic chip elements (for example, adders and multipliers) which Design Compiler uses in logic synthesis.

•

DesignWare Verification Library

is our library of popular chip function models used during the verification process of chip design.

•

DesignWare Cores

are pre-designed and pre-verified design blocks that implement many of the most important industry standards, including USB (1.1, 2.0 and On-The-Go),
PCI (PCI, PCI-X and PCI Express), Ethernet and JPEG.

Finally, Synopsys’ Star IP program permits DesignWare library users to gain access to popular microprocessor cores from leading semiconductor and IP companies. We have worked with these companies to improve the reusability of these
microprocessor cores as well as to integrate them with other DesignWare microprocessor subsystems. The program includes cores from companies like MIPS, NEC and Infineon, and in 2003 we added a PowerPC microprocessor from IBM.

Professional Services

.  We provide a comprehensive portfolio
of consulting services covering all critical phases of the SoC development process, as well as systems development in wireless and broadband applications. We offer customers a variety of engagement models ranging from project assistance, which helps
our customers design, verify and/or test their chips and improve their design processes, to full turnkey development.

New Ventures

Our New Ventures Group includes a number of products and initiatives relating to analog/mixed signal IC design and verification and design for
manufacturing.

Analog Mixed-Signal
Tools

.  Our Cosmos

™

tool is
used to create analog designs. Cosmos uses schematic-driven layout to place and route full-custom ICs. The New Ventures Group also manages development and marketing of our NanoSim and HSPICE tools described above under

Discovery Verification
Platform

.

Design for Manufacturing

.  With
the acquisitions of Avant! and Numerical, we offer a variety of products and technologies used at the intersection of IC design and manufacturing which address a variety of issues, principally those encountered using photolithography techniques to
manufacture ICs when advanced ICs have feature dimensions smaller than the wavelength of light used to expose those dimensions during production. We address these markets through our Design for Manufacturing initiatives, which include:

•

CATS

®

is our mask data preparation product that takes a final IC design and “fractures” or “breaks” it into the physical features that will be
included in the photomasks to be used in manufacturing.

•

Proteus OPC

™

/InPhase

are optical proximity correction (OPC) products which embed and verify corrective features in an IC design and masks to improve manufacturing results for
subwavelength



feature width design. OPC applies systematic changes to mask geometries to compensate for nonlinear distortions caused by optical diffraction and resist
process effects.

•

Phase Shift Masking Technologies

consist of mask design techniques that use optical interference to improve depth-of-field and resolution in subwavelength
photolithography.

•

SiVL

®

(Silicon versus Layout)

verifies the layout of a subwavelength IC against the silicon it is intended to produce by reading in the layout and
simulating lithographic process effects, including optical, resist and etch effects.

•

Virtual Stepper

is our mask qualification product that checks mask quality and analyzes printability of mask defects, helping to separate true defects from
nuisance defects.

Customer Service and Technical Support

We believe a high level of customer service and support
is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products. We provide technical support for our products through both field- and corporate-based application engineering groups. Customers who purchase Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)
receive software maintenance services, also known as “post contract support” (PCS), bundled with their license fee. Customers who purchase term licenses and perpetual licenses may purchase these services separately. See

We generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days. We
also typically provide our customers limited indemnities with respect to claims that their use of our design and verification software products infringe on United States patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. We have not experienced
material warranty or indemnity claims to date.

Support for Industry
Standards

We actively create and support standards we
believe will help our customers increase productivity, improve interoperability of tools from different vendors, and solve design problems. Standards in the EDA industry can be established by formal accredited committees, by licensing made available
to all, or through open source licensing.



Synopsys’ products support many formal standards, including the most commonly used hardware
description languages, VHDL, Verilog HDL, SystemVerilog and SystemC, as well as numerous industry standard data formats for the exchange of data between our tools, other EDA vendor’s products and applications customers develop internally.

Synopsys is a board member and/or participant in the following
major EDA standards organizations: Accellera, a not-for-profit formal standards organization that drives language-based standards for systems, semiconductor, and design tool companies; the interoperability committee of the EDA Consortium, which
helps promote quality and interoperability among EDA products from different vendors; the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a non-profit, technical professional association and a leading developer of global industry
standards; the Virtual Socket Interface Alliance (VSIA), an industry group formed to promote standards that facilitate the integration and reuse of functional blocks of intellectual property; and the Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI), a non-profit
organization that manages SystemC, a language developed by Synopsys and donated to OSCI, with representation from the systems, semiconductor, IP, embedded software and EDA industries.

Synopsys’ TAP-in program provides interface standards to all companies through an open source licensing model. Synopsys
manages changes and enhancements that come from the community of licensees. Synopsys, other EDA companies and EDA customers use these standards to facilitate interoperability of their tools. The standards offered through TAP-in include Liberty for
library modeling, SDC for design constraints, SAIF for switching activity and OpenVera for hardware verification. Synopsys’ common database, Milkyway, is available for tool integration by EDA vendors through our MAP-in program.

Historically, orders and revenue have been lowest in our first fiscal quarter and highest in our fourth
fiscal quarter, with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first quarter of the next fiscal year. We expect the first fiscal quarter will remain our lowest orders and revenue quarter; orders and revenue in other
quarters will vary based on the particular timing and type of individual contracts entered into with large customers.

Synopsys’ aggregate non-cancelable backlog was approximately $1.6 billion on November 1, 2003, representing a 17% increase from the end of the prior
fiscal year. Aggregate non-cancelable backlog includes deferred revenue, operational backlog and financial backlog and excludes all items relating to consulting services. Deferred revenue represents orders for software products, license maintenance
and other services which have been delivered and billed to the customer but the revenue has not yet been earned. Operational backlog consists of orders for system and software products sold under perpetual or term licenses and TSLs with customer
requested ship dates within three months which have not been shipped. Financial backlog consists of future installments to be billed and received from the customer not yet currently due and payable. In the case of a TSL, financial backlog includes
the full amount of the committed non-cancelable order, less any amount of revenue that has been recognized on such TSL.

We have not historically experienced significant order cancellations.

Research and Development

Our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms, maintain and enhance our current
products, develop new products, and meet an expanding range of customer requirements. Research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each business unit. Synopsys also maintains an Advanced Technology Group, which
is responsible for exploring new technologies and maintaining strong research relationships outside Synopsys within both industry and academia.

During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, research and development expenses, net of capitalized software development costs, were $285.9 million, $225.5 million
and $189.8 million, respectively. Synopsys capitalized software development costs were approximately $2.6 million, $1.6 million and $1.0 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial
resources to research and development in the future.

Manufacturing

Synopsys’ manufacturing operations consist of
packaging and shipping CD-ROMs containing software products and the related documentation. We currently conduct these activities through contract vendors, who provide the majority of CD-ROM replication and on-demand printing and distribution of
product media and documentation. We deliver an increasing proportion of our software products by electronic means rather than by shipping disks. When specified by the customer or required by law, Synopsys delivers disks to the customer’s site.
We typically deliver our software products within 10 days of acceptance of customer purchase orders and execution of software license agreements unless the customer requests otherwise.

Competition

The EDA industry is highly competitive. We compete against other EDA vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design
capabilities. In general, we compete on product quality and features, post-sale support, interoperability with other vendors’ products, price, payment terms and, as discussed below, the ability to offer a complete design flow.

Our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and
services, such as Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (Cadence) and Mentor Graphics Corporation, and companies that offer products focused on



a discrete phase or phases of the integrated circuit design process. During the recent semiconductor downturn, we have increasingly competed on the basis of
payment terms and price. During fiscal 2003, we increasingly agreed to extended payment terms on our TSLs, negatively affecting our deferred revenue and cash flow from operations. In addition, in certain situations our competitors offer aggressive
discounts on their products. As a result, average prices may fall, and we may lose potential business where we believe a given discount is not in our best interests.

Increasingly, EDA companies compete on the basis of design flows involving integrated logic and physical design products
rather than on the basis of individual point tools performing a discrete phase of the design process. The need to offer an integrated design flow will become increasingly important as ICs grow more complex. While we have introduced design and
verification platforms that integrate many of the products required to design an IC into a unified flow, we face significant competition from companies that also offer their own integrated design flows, such as Cadence and Magma Design Automation,
Inc. To be successful in the future, we believe we must further integrate our design and verification products, which will continue to require significant engineering and development work. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to offer a
competitive complete design flow to customers. If customers fail to adopt our design and verification platforms or if we are unable to develop new discrete design tools or enhance existing ones to add increased functionality or performance, our
financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.

Product Sales and Licensing Agreements

We typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. The majority of
our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network. License fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed. In certain cases, customers
have the right to use our products over a wide-area network or to exchange a portion of the software under license for different software products of equal value.

We currently offer our software products under three license types: renewable TSLs, renewable term licenses, and perpetual
licenses. For a full discussion of these licenses, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—

Revenue Recognition

below.

With respect to our DesignWare Core intellectual property
products, we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements which provide usage rights for specific applications. Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases,
royalties.

Finally, our professional services teams typically
operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project.

Proprietary Rights

Synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. Our source code is protected both as a trade secret
and as an unpublished copyrighted work. However, third parties may develop similar technology independently. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. We currently hold
United States and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future.

Under our customer agreements and other license agreements, in many cases we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third
party’s intellectual property rights. As a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. For example, we are currently



defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. We believe
this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue this defense.

These types of claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, require us to refund
license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business.

Employees

As of November 1, 2003, Synopsys had 4,362 employees, of whom 2,885 were based in North America and 1,477 were based outside of North America. Our future
financial results depend in part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. We participate in a dynamic
industry, with start-up activity, and our headquarters is in Silicon Valley, where competition for the most highly skilled technical, sales and management employees is intense. Experience at Synopsys is highly valued in the EDA and general
electronics industry, and our employees are recruited aggressively by our competitors and by start-up companies in many industries. We have periodically experienced significant employee turnover. We can provide no assurances that we can retain our
key managerial and technical employees or continue to attract or retain additional highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages, and
we believe our employee relations are good.

Item 2.

Properties

Synopsys’ principal offices are located in four adjacent buildings in Mountain View, California, which together provide approximately 400,000 square feet of available space. This space is leased through February 2015. Within one half
mile of these buildings, in Sunnyvale, California, Synopsys occupies approximately 200,000 square feet of space in two adjacent buildings, which are under lease through April 2007, and approximately 72,000 square feet of space in a third building,
which is under lease through April 2007. We use these buildings for administrative, marketing, research and development and support activities. In addition, Synopsys leases 16,000 square feet of space in Pleasanton and Fremont, California as
telecommute centers. As a result of fiscal 2002 and 2003 acquisitions, we assumed leases of approximately 55,000 square feet of space in San Jose, California, 7,500 square feet of space in Pleasanton and 5,000 square feet of space in Austin, Texas,
none of which we currently occupy.

Synopsys owns two buildings
totaling approximately 230,000 square feet on approximately 43 acres of land in Hillsboro, Oregon, which we use for administrative, marketing, research and development and support activities. In addition, we lease approximately 80,000 square feet of
space in Marlboro, Massachusetts for sales and support, research and development and customer education activities. This facility is leased through January 2009.

Synopsys owns a fourth building in Sunnyvale, California with approximately 120,000 square feet, which is leased to a third
party through February 2009. Synopsys also owns 34 acres of undeveloped land in San Jose, California and 13 acres of undeveloped land in Marlboro, Massachusetts.

Synopsys currently leases 32 other offices throughout the United States primarily for sales and support.

Synopsys leases approximately 45,000 square feet in Dublin, Ireland for its
foreign headquarters and for research and development purposes. This space is leased through April 2026. In addition, Synopsys leases 34

foreign sales and service offices in Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the People’s Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan



and the United Kingdom. We also lease research and development facilities in Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, the
People’s Republic of China, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

We believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Synopsys is currently a party to various claims and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. If management believes a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be
estimated, we record the amount of the loss or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, we assess any potential
liability related to these actions and revise our estimates, if necessary. Based on currently available information, management believes the ultimate outcome of these actions, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and we could therefore receive unfavorable rulings. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction
prohibiting Synopsys from selling one or more products. An unexpected unfavorable ruling could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods.

Selected Financial Data

Financial Summary

(1)

Synopsys has a fiscal year that ends on the Saturday nearest October 31. Fiscal 2003, 2002, 2000 and 1999 were 52-week years while fiscal 2001 was a 53-week year. For presentation
purposes, the consolidated financial statements refer to the calendar month end. Prior to fiscal 2000, Synopsys’ fiscal year ended on the Saturday nearest to September 30. The period from October 1, 1999 through October 31, 1999 was a
transition period. During the transition period, revenue, loss before income taxes, benefit for income taxes and net loss were $23.2 million, $25.5 million, $9.9 million, and $15.5 million, respectively, and basic and diluted loss per share was
$0.11. The net loss during the transition period is due to the fact that sales in the first month following a quarter end are historically lower than in the second and third months. As of October 31, 1999, working capital, total assets, long-term
debt, and stockholders’ equity were $621.9 million, $1.2 billion, $11.3 million and $872.6 million, respectively.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements
and the related “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8, and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors set
forth in this discussion, especially under the caption “Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Generally, the words “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,”
“anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “continue,” or the negatives of such terms, or other comparable terminology and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The information
included in this Form 10-K is as of the filing date with the Securities and Exchange Commission and future events or circumstances could differ significantly from the forward-looking statements included herein. Accordingly, we caution readers not to
place undue reliance on such statements.

Overview

The following is a summary of the discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations and is qualified in its entirety by the fuller discussion contained in this Item 7. This summary should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1, “Business” and is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors
set forth in Item 7 as described below under “Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

Synopsys is the world leader in electronic design automation (EDA) software used to design complex integrated circuits (ICs) and systems-on-chips (SoCs)
in the global semiconductor and electronics industries. Our software and intellectual property products and design services provide a complete IC design and verification solution from original concept to the actual chip, enabling our customers to
bring advanced products to market quickly. See “Item 1, Business” for a more complete description of our business.

Business Environment

As an EDA software provider, we generate substantially all of our revenues from the semiconductor and electronics industries. Our customers typically fund
purchases of our software and services out of their research and development budgets. As a result, our revenues are heavily influenced by our customers’ long-term business outlook, and willingness to invest in new chip designs.

Beginning in late calendar 2000, the semiconductor industry entered its
steepest and longest downturn of the past 20 years, with industry sales dropping by approximately 46% from late 2000 to early 2002. As a result, over the past three years our customers have focused on controlling costs and reducing risk, including
constraining R&D expenditures, cutting back on their design starts, purchasing from fewer suppliers, requiring more favorable pricing and payment terms from those suppliers and pursuing consolidation within their own industry. Further, during
this downturn, many start-up semiconductor design companies failed or were acquired, and the pace of investment in new companies declined.

In response to these conditions, we have focused on providing the most technologically advanced products to address each step in the IC design process, on
integrating these products into broad platforms, and on expanding our product offerings. Our goal is to be the EDA technology supplier of choice for our customers as they pursue longer-term, broader, more flexible relationships with fewer suppliers.
Reflecting this trend, in fiscal 2003 we signed 11 new contracts over $25 million, up from only three in fiscal 2001.

While the semiconductor industry experienced a moderate recovery in 2003, our customers have remained cautious. It is therefore not yet clear when
improved demand in our own customers’ electronics end markets will cause them to significantly increase their R&D spending or their design starts, and hence their spending on EDA.



Product Developments

As the result of a multi-year strategy based upon focused internal development efforts and selective acquisitions, we offer
our customers a comprehensive, end-to-end design flow. Our suite of system design, logic design, functional verification, physical design and physical verification products enables our customers to take an IC from concept all the way to
manufacturing.

Following the completion of the Avant! merger
in mid-2002, we moved quickly to integrate our operations and research and development teams. We have also pursued integration of the products themselves. In February 2003, we announced the combination of many of our leading IC design products into
a single, unified platform called the Galaxy Design Platform, which now includes seven of our twelve highest revenue products: Design Compiler, Apollo/Astro, Physical Compiler, PrimeTime, Hercules, STAR-RCXT and DFT Compiler. Concurrently with this
announcement, we also opened access to our Milkyway design database, which provides a common data repository and improves interoperability among multiple products. Enabling customers and other EDA tool vendors to link their tools directly into the
Milkyway environment will benefit customers and other EDA companies by reducing integration costs and advancing tool interoperability for the electronics industry.

We also announced our Discovery Verification Platform in fiscal 2003, which combines many of our verification and nanometer
level analysis tools in a unified environment to provide high performance and efficient interaction among these technologies, and includes three of our twelve highest revenue products: VCS, HSPICE and NanoSim.

Finally, in March 2003 we completed our acquisition of Numerical
Technologies, Inc., which specializes in sub-wavelength photolithography-enabling solutions, expanding our offerings of manufacturing technologies and products geared towards small geometry designs.

Financial Performance

•

Our revenue for fiscal 2003 was $1,177.0 million, a 30% increase over fiscal 2002, reflecting the first full year of contribution from our mid-fiscal 2002 Avant! acquisition and the
continued phase-in of our time-based licenses.

•

During fiscal 2003, we continued to emphasize licenses on which we recognize revenue over time rather than upfront upon shipment. Time-based license revenue for fiscal 2003
increased 65% to $618.0 million, as compared to $373.6 million in fiscal 2002. Upfront license revenue increased 22% to $298.3 million, as compared to $245.2 million in fiscal 2002. On a percentage basis, time-based and upfront license revenue
constituted 67% and 33%, respectively, of software license revenues in fiscal 2003, as compared to 60% and 40%, respectively, in fiscal 2002.

•

Our maintenance revenue for fiscal 2003 was $220.0 million, down 5% from fiscal 2002 maintenance revenue of $232.7 million, reflecting the impact of including maintenance with our
Technology Subscription Licenses, lower maintenance fees on certain perpetual licenses and generally lower renewal rates.

•

Demand for third party professional services continued to be soft in fiscal 2003. As a result, our services revenues for fiscal 2003 were $40.7 million, down 26% from fiscal 2002
services revenue of $55.1 million.

•

In our four key geographies, North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific, year-to-year revenue increased 13%, 26%, 128% and 45%, respectively.

•

Fiscal 2003 net income was $149.7 million, versus a fiscal 2002 net loss of ($200.0 million). The loss incurred in 2002 was largely driven by the costs associated with the Avant!
acquisition we completed in June 2002. Litigation expense totaled $265.0 million, integration expenses were $128.5 million and in-process research and development expenses totaled $82.5 million.



•

Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 was $391.5 million, compared to cash used by operations in fiscal 2002 of ($181.0 million). The change in cash flow was driven by the cash
used for expenses associated with the Avant! acquisition. At year end, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $698.4 million, up 68% from $414.7 million at the end of fiscal 2002.

•

In September 2003, we completed a two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend.

•

During fiscal 2003, we repurchased, on a post-split basis, 9,407,324 shares of our Common Stock at an average price of $27.72 per share, for a total of $260.7 million. In December,
after the end of our fiscal year, our Board renewed the stock buyback program, authorizing up to $500 million in additional share repurchases.

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2003, we completed (i) our acquisition of Numerical Technologies, Inc. (Numerical) to expand our offerings of design for manufacturing products
and (ii) two other acquisitions we do not consider material for financial statement purposes.

In fiscal 2002, we acquired: (i) Avant! Corporation (Avant!), a leading developer of software used in the physical design and physical verification phases of IC design; (ii) Co-Design Automation, Inc. (Co-Design), a
developer of simulation software used in the high-level verification stage of the chip design process; and (iii) inSilicon Corporation (inSilicon), which developed, marketed and licensed an extensive portfolio of silicon intellectual property.

Our results of operations include the revenues attributable to
products acquired in these mergers that are recognized after the respective merger dates but not any revenues recognized by these acquired companies prior to their respective merger dates. In addition, these acquisitions caused us to incur charges
related to these acquisitions, such as amortization of goodwill, intangible assets and deferred stock compensation, and integration, as more fully discussed below.

Critical Accounting Policies

We base the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which we
prepare in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing these financial statements, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results
may differ from these estimates.

The accounting policies that
most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:

•

Revenue recognition;

•

Valuation of intangible assets;

•

Income taxes;

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts; and

•

Strategic investments.

.

With respect to software sales,
Synopsys utilizes three license types:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

, which are for a finite term, on average approximately three years, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or
to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Post-contract customer support (maintenance or PCS) is bundled for the term of the license and not charged for separately.

•

Term licenses

, which are also for a finite term, usually two to three years, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for,
unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

•

Perpetual licenses

, which continue as long as the customer renews maintenance, plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to
receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. The annual maintenance fee for purchases under $2 million is typically calculated as a
percentage of the list price of the licensed software; for purchases over $2 million, the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

We report revenue in three categories: upfront license revenue, time-based
license revenue and services.

Upfront license revenue
includes:

•

Perpetual licenses

. We recognize the perpetual license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the perpetual
license fee within one year from shipment.

•

Upfront term licenses

. We recognize the term license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the term license
fee within one year from shipment.

Time-based
license revenue includes:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses

. We typically recognize revenue from TSL license fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period.
However, where extended payment terms (as discussed below) are offered under the license arrangement, we recognize revenue from TSL license fees in an amount that is the lesser of the ratable portion of the entire fee or customer installments as
they become due and payable.

•

Term Licenses with Extended Payment Terms

. For term licenses where less than 75% of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as
customer installments become due and payable.

Services revenue includes:

•

Maintenance Fees Associated with Perpetual and Term Licenses

. We generally recognize revenue from maintenance associated with perpetual and term licenses ratably over the
maintenance term.



•

Consulting and Training Fees

. We generally recognize revenue from consulting and training services as services are performed.

We allocate revenue on software transactions (referred to as an
“arrangement” in the accounting literature) involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements. Our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on
vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately.

We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the
maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to consulting. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method
in accordance with SOP 98-9 and recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term.

Customers occasionally request the right to convert their existing TSLs to perpetual licenses. Customers pay an incremental fee to convert the TSL to a
perpetual license, which we recognize upon contract signing, in accordance with AICPA Technical Practice Aid (TPA) 5100.74, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In some situations, the contract converting the TSL to a
perpetual license is modified to such an extent that a new arrangement exists. The changes to the contract may include increases or decreases in the total technology under license, changes in payment terms, changes in license terms and other
pertinent factors. In these situations, we account for all of the arrangement fees as a new sale and recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We have a policy that defines the specific circumstances under which
such transactions are accounted for as a new perpetual license sale.

We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred,
(iii) our fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is probable. We apply these criteria as discussed below.

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists

. We require a written contract, signed by both the customer and us, or a purchase order from those customers that have previously
negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement.

•

Delivery Has Occurred

. We deliver software to our customers physically or electronically. For physical deliveries, our standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping
point. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or “keys” that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware.

•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable

. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard
payment terms require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year. Where these terms apply, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and we recognize revenue upon delivery (assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met).
If the payment terms do not meet this standard, which we refer to as “extended payment terms,” we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the
case of a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable, due to application of other revenue accounting guidelines.

•

Collectibility is Probable

. To recognize revenue, we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees, which we do on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant
to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new



customer, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the
credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize
revenue on a cash-collected basis.

Valuation of Intangible Assets

.    We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible
assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer-installed base/relationships, trademarks and tradenames, covenants not to compete, customer backlog and capitalized software. Factors that could trigger an impairment
review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative
industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment
indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the acquired entity or technology over the remaining amortization period, we will reduce the net carrying value of the related
intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. We did not record any impairment charges
on our intangible assets during fiscal 2003. As of October 31, 2003, the carrying amount of our intangible assets, net was $285.6 million.

We evaluate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance
with Statement of Financial Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142),

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired, we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the
two-step method prescribed by SFAS 142. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. We did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal 2003. As of
October 31, 2003, the carrying amount of our goodwill, net was $550.7 million.

Income Taxes

.    The relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate. We are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple
jurisdictions in which we operate. As of October 31, 2003, current net deferred tax assets and long-term liabilities totaled $248.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively. We believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets. We consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance, and if we determine we
would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would charge to income an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination.

We provide for United States (U.S.) income taxes on the earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the United States. As of October 31, 2003, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided is approximately $176.7
million. As of October 31, 2003, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $49.1 million.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

.    We estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable on an account-by-account basis and
establish a specific reserve for any particular receivable when we determine collectibility is not probable. In addition, we provide a general reserve on all accounts receivable, which we calculate as a percentage, determined within a specified
range of percentages of the outstanding balance in each aged group. In determining this percentage, we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt expense, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, international
exposures (such as currency devaluation), and changes in our customer payment terms to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful



accounts. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, impairing their ability to make payments, we may need to establish additional allowances.
As of October 31, 2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.3 million.

Strategic Investments

.    We review our investments in non-public companies on a quarterly basis and estimate the amount of any impairment incurred during the current period based on a
specific analysis of each investment, considering the activities of and events occurring at each of the underlying portfolio companies during the quarter. Our portfolio companies operate in industries that are rapidly evolving and extremely
competitive. For equity investments in non-public companies where we cannot readily determine market value, we assess each investment for indicators of impairment at each quarter end based primarily on achievement of business plan objectives and
current market conditions, among other factors, and information available to us at the time of assessment. The primary business plan objectives we consider include achievement of planned financial results, completion of capital raising activities,
the launching of technology, the hiring of key employees and the portfolio company’s overall progress on its business plan. If we determine an investment in a portfolio company is impaired, absent quantitative valuation metrics, management
estimates the impairment and/or the net realizable value of the portfolio investment based on public- and private-company market comparable information and valuations completed for companies similar to our portfolio companies. Future adverse changes
in market conditions, poor operating results of underlying investments and other information obtained after our quarterly assessment could result in additional losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investments thereby
requiring a further impairment charge in the future. As of October 31, 2003, we valued our strategic investments at $8.6 million.

Results of Operations

Synopsys generates revenue primarily from licensing its software and intellectual property, from sales of maintenance, and from providing consulting
services. In our licensing activities, to respond to our customers’ respective technology, flexibility and budget requirements, we have offered a variety of license types. We generally classify those license types as TBLs on which revenue is
recognized over time, and upfront licenses on which revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment. These license types vary significantly in terms of access to technology, duration, flexibility and payment terms. See

Revenue Recognition

above for a full discussion of our types of licenses and services and the revenue recognition associated with each.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we principally licensed our software via perpetual licenses and upfront term licenses, with the license
revenue typically recognized upfront at the time the order was received and maintenance recognized ratably over the maintenance term. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we introduced Time Subscription Licenses. Since we bundle products and
maintenance in TSLs, we generally recognize both product and service TSL revenue ratably over the term of the license, or, if later, as payments become due. As a result, a TSL order results in significantly lower current-period revenue than an
equal-sized order for a perpetual or upfront term license. Conversely, a TSL order will result in higher revenues recognized in future periods than an equal-sized order for a perpetual or upfront term license. For example, for a $120,000 order for a
perpetual or upfront term license, we recognize $120,000 of revenue in the quarter the product is shipped and no revenue in future quarters. For a $120,000 order for a 3-year TSL shipped on the first day of the quarter, we recognize $10,000 of
revenue in the quarter the product is shipped and in each of the 11 succeeding quarters.

Because we generally recognize revenue on TSLs ratably over the TSL term, our reported revenue dropped significantly following our adoption of TSLs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. In each quarter since adoption,
however, our ratable revenue has grown as TSL orders we receive each quarter contribute revenue that is “layered” over the revenue ratably recognizable from TSL orders we received in prior quarters. As the TSL model matures, growth in
ratable revenue in any quarter will depend on revenue derived from new TSL orders



received in the quarter, offset by the loss of revenue from TSLs that expire in such quarter or the prior quarter, which cease to contribute to revenue. Due
to the “layering” effect, revenue may grow from quarter to quarter for some time even if orders do not grow. The complete phase-in period of the TSL model is difficult to predict, as it is affected by mergers and acquisitions and by the
precise mix of TSL orders received. We expect, however, that when the TSL model is fully phased in over the long term, revenue growth should track orders growth on a percentage basis.

Our license revenue in any given quarter depends upon the volume of upfront licenses shipped during the quarter, the amount
of TBL revenue recognized from TBLs booked in prior periods, and to a much smaller degree, the amount of revenue recognized on TBL orders booked during the quarter. We set our revenue targets based in large part on orders targets and our expected
mix of perpetual licenses, term licenses and TSLs for a given period. If we achieve the total order target but not our target license mix, we may not reach our revenue targets (if upfront license orders are lower than we expect), or may exceed them
(if upfront license orders are higher than we expect). If we achieve the target license mix but orders are below target, then we will not meet our revenue targets.

The precise mix of orders can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter. Our historical license order mix since
adopting TSLs in August 2000 has been 24% upfront licenses and 76% time-based licenses, although the percentage of upfront license orders in any given quarter has been as high as 33% and as low as 14%. The license mix for the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003 was 33% upfront and 67% time-based as compared to 27% upfront and 73% time-based for the same period in fiscal 2002.

Revenue

.    Revenue consists of fees for upfront and time-based licenses of our software and intellectual property products,
maintenance, customer training and consulting. We classify revenue as upfront license, time-based license or services. Upfront license revenue consists primarily of perpetual and upfront term software licenses. Time-based license revenue consists of
revenue from our TSLs and from term licenses which have extended payment terms as discussed above. Service revenue consists of maintenance under perpetual and term licenses and fees for consulting services and training.

Total revenue for fiscal 2003 increased 30% to $1,177.0 million as compared
to $906.5 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2003 is primarily due to (i) contribution of Avant! products for a full fiscal year, (ii) continued phase-in of the TSL model and (iii) license renewals with many of our
largest Japanese customers in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, a relatively high proportion of which were perpetual licenses. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we reintroduced term licenses. Total revenue from term licenses in fiscal 2003 was
$3.6 million.

Total revenue for fiscal 2002 increased 33% to
$906.5 million as compared to $680.4 million for fiscal 2001. The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 is due primarily to the contribution of Avant! products from June 2002 through the end of fiscal 2002 and to the
ongoing phase in of the TSL license model.

Upfront license
revenue for fiscal 2003 increased 22% to $298.3 million as compared to $245.2 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in upfront license revenue is primarily due to the contribution of Avant! products for a full fiscal year and license renewals with
many of our largest Japanese customers in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, a relatively high proportion of which were perpetual licenses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we began offering to some of our customers that entered into
perpetual licenses in excess of $2 million variable maintenance arrangements under which the annual maintenance fee is calculated as a percentage of the net license fee rather than as a fixed percentage of the list price. These arrangements
accounted for $220.0 million of our product sales in fiscal 2003 as compared to $131.6 million in fiscal 2002.

Upfront license revenue for fiscal 2002 increased 50% to $245.2 million as compared to $163.9 million for fiscal 2001. The increase in upfront license
revenue for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was due to an



increase in perpetual licenses delivered during the period, which resulted in large part from the increased volume of perpetual licenses after the Avant!
merger.

Time-based license revenue for fiscal 2003 increased
65% to $618.0 million as compared to $373.6 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in time-based license revenue is due to the additional quarters that the TSL license model has been used and to the increased volume of time-based license sales
contributed by Avant! products for a full fiscal year.

Time-based license revenue for fiscal 2002 increased 114% to $373.6 million as compared to $174.6 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in ratable license revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to the additional quarters
that the TSL license model has been used and to the increased volume of ratable license sales resulting from the Avant! merger.

Service revenue for fiscal 2003 decreased 9% to $260.7 million as compared to $287.7 million in fiscal 2002. Service revenue for fiscal 2002 decreased 16%
to $287.7 million as compared to $341.8 million for fiscal 2001. These decreases in service revenue were primarily due to the impact of our adoption of TSLs, which bundle maintenance with the software and do not contribute any separately recognized
service revenue. Further, economic conditions led our customers to reduce their costs by curtailing their use of outside consultants such as our professional services personnel, and, in some cases, discontinuing maintenance on their perpetual
licenses. In addition, customers deferred or cancelled a number of projects in our consulting backlog and reduced certain expenditures on training. And finally, our adoption of variable maintenance perpetual arrangements in fiscal 2002 has
substantially lowered our maintenance fees from perpetual licenses.

Related Party Transactions

.    Revenues derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 9.5% and 7.9% of fiscal 2003 and 2002 revenues, respectively. Andy D.
Bryant, Intel Corporation’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer, also serves on our Board of Directors. Management believes the transactions between the two parties were carried out on an arm’s
length basis.

Revenue
Seasonality

.    Historically, orders and revenue have been lowest in our first fiscal quarter and highest in our fourth fiscal quarter, with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first
quarter of the next fiscal year. We expect the first fiscal quarter will remain our lowest orders and revenues quarter; orders and revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular timing and type of individual contracts entered into with
large customers.

Revenue

Product
Groups

.    For management reporting purposes, we organize our products and services into five distinct groups: Galaxy Design Platform, Discovery Verification Platform, Intellectual Property (IP), New Ventures and Professional
Services & Other. The following table summarizes the revenue attributable to these groups as a percentage of total revenue for the last twelve quarters. We include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered
from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods. For presentation purposes, we allocate maintenance, which represented approximately 18% of our total revenue and approximately 84% of our total services revenue for fiscal 2003, to
the products to which those support services relate. Further, with the adoption of our platform strategy in fiscal 2003, we redefined our product groups and have reclassified prior period revenues in accordance with this new grouping to provide a
consistent presentation.

Between any two quarters, the
percentage of our total revenue from each group fluctuates based on the mix of upfront versus time-based orders received for these products during the quarter. Further, since our adoption of TSLs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, an increasing
percentage of the revenue in a given quarter in the Galaxy Design Platform, Discovery Verification Platform and New Ventures groups is from customer orders placed in preceding quarters. Accordingly, for the Galaxy Design Platform, Discovery
Verification Platform and New Ventures groups, quarter-to-quarter changes are not necessarily indicative of fundamental strength or weakness in those groups.



Galaxy Design
Platform

.    Our Galaxy Design Platform includes our logic synthesis, physical synthesis, physical design, timing analysis, signal integrity analysis and physical verification products. Our principal products in this
category at October 31, 2003 were Design Compiler, Apollo, Astro, Physical Compiler, Prime Time, Hercules, Star RXCT and DFT Compiler.

Revenue for this platform increased significantly in percentage and absolute dollar terms following the Avant! merger in the third quarter of fiscal 2002,
primarily because this product group represented the largest portion of Avant!’s revenue before the acquisition. The percentage increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 was due to a number of large orders, many of which were perpetual
licenses, by Japanese customers in that quarter. Going forward, we believe physical implementation, physical synthesis and design analysis products will account for an increasing share of Galaxy Design Platform revenues relative to our logic
synthesis products as customers recognize the importance of using physical level and design analysis tools to address design challenges particular to small geometry designs.

Discovery Verification Platform

.    Our Discovery Verification Platform includes our
verification and simulation products. Our principal products in this category are VCS, HSPICE, NanoSim, Formality, Vera and System Studio. Though the Avant! merger added few verification products, revenue for this platform as a percentage of total
revenue has remained fairly consistent, reflecting continued adoption of these tools by our customers. In absolute dollar terms, revenue from this platform has generally increased consistently with our overall averages.

Intellectual Property

.    Our IP products
include the DesignWare library of IC design components and verification models and inSilicon products we acquired in September 2002. IP revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 principally
because we acquired few IP products in the Avant! merger, but increased beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 due to increased sales of our DesignWare cores and products acquired in the inSilicon merger, particularly in the communications
and connectivity areas.

New
Ventures

.    Our New Ventures products include our analog and mixed signal and design for manufacturing tools. We had no revenue from these tools prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2002, when we acquired Avant!. New
Ventures revenue as a percentage of total revenue has since increased moderately primarily as a result of the growing need for tools and methodologies required for smaller geometry designs, and has increased in absolute dollar terms consistently
with our overall averages.

Professional Services &
Other

.    The Professional Services Group provides consulting services, including design methodology assistance, specialized systems design services, turnkey design and training. As a percentage of total revenue, revenue
from this product group declined significantly through the second quarter of fiscal 2003, reflecting a decrease in consulting orders from our customers due to difficult economic conditions as discussed above under

Revenue

, and the fact that
Avant! did not have a significant professional services business.



Workforce Realignment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we decided
to realign our operations, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, in order to focus resources on more strategic areas of investment and to become more operationally efficient. This realignment affected a total of approximately 240 employees
(140 in the U.S. and 100 outside the U.S.) in all departments in domestic and foreign locations. The associated charge for fiscal 2003 was $14.9 million consisting of severance and other termination benefits, which are generally much higher in
locations outside the U.S., and is reflected in the consolidated statement of income as follows:

We expect to incur
additional costs between $3 million and $4 million during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2004 related to the consolidation of excess facilities and to the termination of certain lease obligations.

Temporary Shutdown of Operations

.    During the
third quarter of fiscal 2003, we had a four-day shutdown of operations in North America as a cost-saving measure. The savings relates primarily to salaries and benefits as follows:

Work Force
Reduction

.    We reduced our workforce during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The purpose was to reduce expenses by decreasing the number of employees in all departments in domestic and
foreign locations. As a result, we decreased our workforce by approximately 200 and 175 employees during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and the second quarter of fiscal 2002, respectively. The associated charge for fiscal 2003 was $4.4 million as
compared to $3.9 million for fiscal 2002. The charge consists of severance and other termination benefits and is reflected in the consolidated statements of income as follows:

Cost of
Revenue

.    Cost of revenue consists of the cost of product revenue, cost of service revenue, cost of ratable license revenue and amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation. Cost of product revenue
includes personnel and related costs, production costs, product packaging, documentation and



amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased technology. Cost of service revenue includes consulting services, personnel and related
costs associated with providing training and maintenance on perpetual and term licenses. Cost of ratable license revenue includes the costs of product and services related to our TSLs. Cost of product revenue, cost of service revenue and cost of
ratable license revenue during any period are heavily dependent on the mix of software orders received during such period.

Cost of revenue amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights intangible associated
with certain executory contracts and the amortization of core/ developed technology related to acquisitions which occurred in fiscal 2003 and 2002. There was no cost of revenue amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation in
fiscal 2001. Total amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation included in cost of revenues is as follows:

Total cost of revenue
as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2003 increased to 20% as compared to 19% in fiscal 2002. This increase is primarily due to an increase in amortization of contract rights intangible and core/developed technology recorded as a result of
our acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and 2002, the cost of our realignment of operations totaling $2.6 million as discussed above under

Workforce Realignment,

additional royalties of $1.5 million and other termination benefits of $1.2 million as
discussed above under

Work Force Reduction.

Our total product costs are relatively fixed and do not fluctuate significantly with changes in revenue or changes in revenue recognition methods.

Total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2002
remained relatively flat at 19% as compared to fiscal 2001. Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation, as a percentage of total revenue decreased due to the increase in quarterly amortization of
deferred revenue and backlog, which is an inherent result of the use of the ratable license model until fully phased in and due to the fact that other cost of revenue components remained relatively flat. However, this decrease as a percentage of
total revenue in fiscal 2002 was offset by the commencement of amortization of the contract rights intangible and core/developed technology recorded as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002.

Research and Development.

Research and
development expenses for fiscal 2003 increased 27% to $285.9 million as compared to $225.5 million in fiscal 2002. The increase consists primarily of (i) $30.7 million in research and development personnel and related costs as a result of
acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003 and including additional employer payroll taxes incurred as a result of an increase in the number of stock option exercises during the fiscal year; (ii) $22.2 million in increased human resources, information
technology and facilities costs to research and development as a result of the increase in research and development headcount as a percentage of total headcount; (iii) $6.3 million as a result of our realignment of operations as discussed above
under

Workforce Realignment;

and (iv) $2.3 million in consulting services. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $2.8 million.

Research and development expenses for fiscal 2002 increased 19% to $225.5 million as compared to $189.8 million for fiscal
2001. The increase in expenses is due to increases of (i) $28.7 million in compensation and compensation-related costs as a result of an increase in research and development headcount due to the Avant! merger; (ii) $11.3 million in human resources,
technology and facilities costs as a result of increased research and



development staffing; and (iii) $4.2 million in depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases of (i) $5.4 million in consulting
expenses and (ii) $4.3 million of other expenses including facilities, travel, communications, supplies and recruiting as a result of our cost reduction programs.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2003 increased 17% to $310.7
million as compared to $264.8 million in fiscal 2002. The increase consists primarily of (i) $42.4 million in additional sales and marketing personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003 and including additional
employer payroll taxes incurred as a result of an increase in the number of stock option exercises during the fiscal year offset by savings from a four-day shutdown of operations in North America; (ii) $4.8 million as a result of our realignment of
operations as discussed above under

Workforce Realignment;

and (iii) $2.7 million in additional travel expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million in human resources, technology and facilities costs to sales
and marketing expenses as a result of a decrease in sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount.

Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2002 decreased 3% to $264.8 million as compared to $274.0 million in fiscal 2001. The overall decrease is due to
decreases of (i) $8.4 million in human resources, technology and facilities costs as a result of a decrease in sales and marketing headcount as a percentage of total headcount; (ii) $1.3 million in employee functions; (iii) $1.4 million in
consulting expenses; and (iv) $2.8 million in other expenses including communications and supplies, foundation contributions, professional services, subscriptions and memberships as a result of our cost reduction efforts. These decreases were
partially offset by increases of (i) $4.8 million in compensation and related costs attributable to an increase in sales and marketing headcount resulting from the Avant! merger and (ii) $1.9 million in travel relating to customer visits to discuss
the integration of Synopsys and Avant! products.

General
and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2003 increased 15% to $90.0 million as compared to $78.5 million in fiscal 2002. The increase consists primarily of (i) $12.8 million in additional general
and administrative personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2002 and 2003 and including additional employer taxes incurred as a result of an increase in the number of stock option exercises during the current year; (ii) $7.0
million in depreciation on upgrades to our information technology infrastructure; (iii) $5.7 million in facilities costs due to new leases during the current year and the expiration of a sublease on one of Synopsys’ buildings in June 2003; (iv)
$3.7 million in professional services costs, patent prosecution expenditures, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and litigation; (v) $2.8 million in maintenance agreements covering more software and computing equipment due to acquisitions in fiscal 2002
and 2003; and (vi) $1.2 million related to the realignment of operations as discussed above under

Workforce Realignment

. These increases were offset by a decrease of (i) $14.2 million in human resources, technology and facilities costs to
general and administrative expenses as a result of a decrease in general and administrative headcount as a percentage of total headcount; and (ii) a decrease of $6.6 million in bad debt expense as accounts receivable aging improved year over year.

General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002 increased
13% to $78.5 million as compared to $69.7 million in fiscal 2001. The overall increase is due to increases of (i) $11.1 million in facilities costs as a result of an increased number of sites due to the Avant! merger; (ii) $7.0 million in
compensation and compensation-related costs as a result of increased headcount due to the Avant! merger; (iii) $5.6 million in professional service fees; (iv) $2.2 million in communications costs; (v) $1.6 million in equipment to update licenses for
our internal enterprise application systems; (vi) $1.4 million in depreciation; and (vii) $2.9 million in other expenses including travel and property tax assessments. These increases were offset by decreases of (i) $20.0 million as a result of
decreased general and administrative headcount as a percentage of total headcount and (ii) $3.9 million in consulting costs as a result of our cost reduction efforts.

Integration Costs.

Non-recurring integration costs incurred relate to merger activities which
are not included in the purchase consideration under Emerging Issues Task Force Number 95-3 (EITF 95-3),

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination

. These costs are expensed as



incurred. During fiscal 2002, integration costs were $128.5 million and consisted primarily of (i) $95.0 million related to the premium for the insurance
policy acquired in conjunction with the Avant! merger; (ii) $14.7 million related to write-downs of Synopsys facilities and property under the management approved facility exit plan for the Avant! merger; (iii) $10.0 million and $0.7 million related
to severance costs for Synopsys employees who were terminated and costs associated with transition employees as a result of the Avant! and inSilicon mergers, respectively; (iv) $1.3 million related to the write-off of software licenses owned by
Synopsys which were originally purchased from Avant!; (v) $3.7 million goodwill impairment charge related to a prior Synopsys acquisition as a result of the acquisition of Avant!; and (vi) $1.2 million and $1.9 million of other expenses including
travel and certain professional fees for the Avant! and Co-Design mergers, respectively.

In-Process Research and Development.

Purchased in-process research and development (IPRD) of $19.9 million and $87.7 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, represents the
write-off of in-process technologies associated with our acquisitions of Numerical in fiscal 2003 and Avant! and inSilicon in fiscal 2002. There were no acquisitions during fiscal 2001. At the date of each acquisition, the projects associated with
the IPRD efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition dates of each of the acquired
companies.

Valuation of
IPRD.

The value assigned to acquired in-process technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established. The value of in-process technology is
then segmented into two classifications: (i) developed technology (completed) and (ii) in-process technology (to-be-completed), giving explicit consideration to the value created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior
to the date of acquisition and to be created by Synopsys after the acquisition. These value creation efforts were estimated by considering the following major factors: (i) time-based data, (ii) cost-based data and (iii) complexity-based data.

The value of the in-process technology was determined using a
discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach, focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in-process technologies. Under this approach, the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the
identified products within the classification segments. Revenue estimates were based on (i) individual product revenues, (ii) anticipated growth rates, (iii) anticipated product development and introduction schedules, (iv) product sales cycles, and
(v) the estimated life of a product’s underlying technology. From the revenue estimates, operating expense estimates, including costs of sales, general and administrative, selling and marketing, income taxes and a use charge for contributory
assets, were deducted to arrive at operating income. Revenue growth rates were estimated by management for each product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected industry trends, the anticipated nature and timing
of new product introductions by us and our competitors, individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product’s underlying technology. Operating expense estimates reflect Synopsys’ historical expense ratios. Additionally,
these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility. The resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition.

The rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased
in-process technology is our weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from
technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in-process technology, the useful life of such technology, the profitability levels of such technology, if any, and the uncertainty of
technological advances, all of which are unknown at this time.

Numerical

.    On March 1, 2003, we acquired Numerical, which specialized in subwavelength lithography-enabling solutions. The IPRD expense related to the Numerical acquisition was $18.3 million. Numerical had five
IPRD projects—Phase Shift Masking (PSM), Subwavelength Software, Equipment Software, Cadabra and Computer Aided Transcription System (CATS)—representing 25%, 7%, 6%, 5% and 57%, respectively, of the total



IPRD value. These projects were expected to be completed shortly following the completion of the merger. PSM, Subwavelength Software and CATS were completed
in fiscal 2003. Cadabra was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Equipment Software project consists of in-process technology for multiple products. These products were either completed in fiscal 2003, discontinued or are expected to be
integrated with other Synopsys products during fiscal 2004. Expenditures to complete Numerical’s IPRD approximate the original estimates.

inSilicon

.    On September 20, 2002, we acquired inSilicon, a leading provider of connectivity semiconductor intellectual
property used by semiconductor and systems companies to design systems-on-chip that are critical components of innovative wired and wireless products. The IPRD expense related to the inSilicon acquisition was $5.2 million. inSilicon had three IPRD
projects—DELA, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express and Universal Serial Business Physical (USB PHY)—accounting for 54%, 23% and 23% of the total IPRD value, respectively. These projects were 25%, 67% and 20% complete at the
time of acquisition, respectively. During fiscal 2003, Synopsys decided to no longer pursue the DELA project. PCI Express is approximately 80% complete and USB PHY has been completed. Expenditures to complete USB PHY and expected expenditures to
complete PCI Express approximate the original estimates.

Avant!.

On June 6, 2002, we acquired Avant!, a leading developer of software used in the physical design and physical verification stages of IC design. The IPRD expense related to the Avant! merger was $82.5
million. The principal in-process technologies were identified based on the following product families:

These projects were
completed during fiscal 2002 and 2003. Expenditures to complete the acquired in-process technologies approximated the original estimates.

The risks associated with acquired research and development are considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will generate any benefit
to us or meet market expectations.

Amortization of
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Deferred Stock Compensation.

Amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships and covenants not
to compete and is included in operating expenses as follows:

The increase in
amortization of intangible assets is due primarily to fiscal 2003 and 2002 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142 on November 1, 2002.



The following table presents the estimated future amortization of deferred stock compensation reported in
both cost of revenue and operating expenses:

Impairment of
Intangible Assets.

In fiscal 2002, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $3.8 million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value.
Approximately $3.7 million and $0.1 million are included in integration expense and amortization of intangible assets, respectively, on the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge is primarily attributable to certain technology
acquired from and goodwill related to the acquisition of Stanza, Inc. (Stanza) in 1999. During fiscal 2002, we determined that we would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology as products acquired in the
merger with Avant! provided customers with superior capabilities. As a result, we do not anticipate any future sales of the Stanza product.

In fiscal 2001, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $2.2 million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior
acquisitions to their estimated fair value. Approximately $1.8 million and $0.4 million are included in cost of revenues and amortization of intangible assets, respectively, on the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge is
attributable to certain technology acquired from and goodwill related to the acquisition of Eagle Design Automation, Inc. (Eagle) in 1997. During fiscal 2001, we determined that we would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth
of this technology. As a result, we do not anticipate any future sales of the Eagle product.

There were no impairment charges during fiscal 2003.

Other (Expense) Income, Net

.    Other income, net was $24.1 million in fiscal 2003 and consisted primarily of (i) realized gain on investments of $20.7 million; (ii) rental income of $6.3
million; (iii) interest income of $5.2 million; (iv) impairment charges related to certain assets in our venture portfolio of ($4.5) million; (vii) foundation contributions of ($2.1) million; and (viii) interest expense of ($1.6) million.

Other (expense), net of other income was ($208.6) million in
fiscal 2002 and consisted primarily of (i) ($240.8) million expense due to the settlement of the Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (Cadence) litigation; (ii) ($11.3) million in impairment charges related to certain assets in our venture portfolio; (iii)
realized gains on investments of $22.7 million; (iv) a gain of $3.1 million for the termination fee on the IKOS Systems, Inc. (IKOS) merger agreement; (v) rental income of $10.0 million; (vi) interest income of $8.3 million; and (vii) and other
miscellaneous expenses including amortization of premium forwards and foreign exchange gains and losses recognized during the fiscal year of ($0.6) million.

Other income, net was $83.8 million in fiscal 2001 and consisted primarily of (i) a gain of $10.6 million on the sale of our silicon libraries business to
Artisan Components, Inc.; (ii) ($5.8) million in impairment charges related to certain assets in our venture portfolio; (iii) realized gains on investments of $55.3 million; (iv) rental income of $8.6 million; (v) interest income of $12.8 million;
and (vi) other miscellaneous income including amortization of premium forwards and foreign exchange gains and losses recognized during the fiscal year of $2.3 million.

Termination of Agreement to Acquire IKOS Systems, Inc.

On July 2, 2001, we entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the IKOS Merger Agreement) with IKOS Systems, Inc. The IKOS Merger Agreement provided for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of IKOS common stock by Synopsys.



On December 7, 2001, Mentor Graphics Corporation (Mentor) commenced a cash tender offer to acquire all of
the outstanding shares of IKOS common stock at $11.00 per share, subject to a number of conditions. On March 12, 2002, Synopsys and IKOS executed a termination agreement by which the parties terminated the IKOS Merger Agreement and pursuant to which
IKOS paid Synopsys the $5.5 million termination fee required by the IKOS Merger Agreement. This termination fee and $2.4 million of expenses incurred in conjunction with the acquisition are included in other income, net on the consolidated statement
of operations for the year ended October 31, 2002. Synopsys subsequently executed a revised termination agreement with Mentor and IKOS in order to add Mentor as a party thereto.

Effect of New Accounting Standards

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. We adopted SFAS 142 on November 1, 2002 and ceased amortizing goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to July 1, 2001. In addition, as of November 1, 2002, we assessed the useful lives and residual values
of all acquired intangible assets recorded on the balance sheet and also tested goodwill for impairment per SFAS 142. In our impairment analysis, we determined we have one reporting unit. We completed the goodwill impairment review as of the
beginning of fiscal 2003 and found no indicators of impairment. This impairment review was based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization. As of October 31, 2003, unamortized goodwill was $550.7 million, which, in accordance with
SFAS 142, we will not amortize.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
increased $283.6 million, or 68%, to $698.4 million as of October 31, 2003 from $414.7 million as of October 31, 2002. Our source of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments over the last three years has been from funds generated from our
business, including cash on hand from companies we have acquired.

Cash provided by operations was $391.5 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to cash used by operations of $181.0 million in fiscal 2002. Cash flow in fiscal 2002 reflected the payment of $335.8 million in insurance premiums related to
settlement of litigation between Avant!, which we acquired in June 2002, and Cadence, resulting in a net loss for the year. Cash provided by operations is directly related to the payment terms we grant on sales of our software and services. During
fiscal 2003, we have increasingly granted extended payment terms to our customers, negatively affecting cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations in 2003 reflected a significant cash tax benefit resulting form the net loss in fiscal 2002.
During fiscal 2003 cash was provided by net income adjusted for non-cash related items, for cash flows related to hedging activities and by an increase in deferred revenue due to continued sales of TSLs. Cash used for changes in working capital
balances included decreases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and accounts receivable. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased as a result of payments of merger-related accruals, commissions and year-end bonuses, partially offset
by current year accruals. Accounts receivable decreased due to the timing of installment billings to customers on long-term arrangements.

Cash used in investing activities was $258.3 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $275.7 million in fiscal 2002.
During fiscal 2003, the following occurred: (i) cash paid for acquisitions totaled $167.7 million; (ii) net purchases of short- and long-term investments totaled $37.8 million; and (iii) capital expenditures totaled $50.1 million. In fiscal 2002,
the following occurred: (i) cash received from acquisitions totaled $168.3 million; (ii) proceeds from net sales of investments totaled $157.8 million; and (iii) capital expenditures totaled $48.8 million.

Cash provided by financing activities was $74.2 million in fiscal 2003 as
compared to cash used in financing activities of $51.8 million in fiscal 2002. The increase of $126.0 million in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to an increase in proceeds of $215.1 million from the sale of shares pursuant to
our



employee stock option plans during fiscal 2003 offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock. During fiscal 2003, Synopsys repurchased treasury
stock of $260.7 million as compared to $171.7 million in fiscal 2002.

Accounts receivable, net of allowances, decreased $6.2 million, or 3%, to $201.0 million as of October 31, 2003 from $207.2 million as of October 31, 2002. Days sales outstanding, calculated based on revenues for the most recent quarter and
accounts receivable at the balance sheet date, decreased to 58 days as of October 31, 2003 from 61 days as of October 31, 2002. The decrease in days sales outstanding is due in part to the timing of large cash collections realized during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003.

On November 22, 2002 and December 16,
2002, we made payments to Cadence totaling $20.0 million and $245.0 million, respectively, under the terms of the settlement agreement relating to litigation between Cadence and Avant!. See Note 3 of our

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

in Part II, Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

.

On March 1, 2003, we completed our acquisition of Numerical Technologies, Inc. We paid Numerical common stock holders $7.00 in cash in exchange for each share of Numerical common stock owned as of the merger date, or
approximately $240.2 million in total and $161.3 million net of cash held by Numerical at the merger date. We paid for Numerical common stock out of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments
and cash generated from operations will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Stock Option Plans

Under our 1992 Stock Option Plan (the 1992 Plan), 38,951,016 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1992 Plan, the Board of Directors (the Board) may grant either incentive or non-qualified stock options
to purchase shares of common stock to eligible individuals at not less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1992 Plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire ten years
from the date of grant. As of October 31, 2003, 9,003,784 stock options remain outstanding and 7,479,776 shares of common stock are reserved for future grants under this plan.

Under our 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan), 53,247,068 shares of common stock have been authorized for
issuance. Pursuant to the 1998 Plan, the Board may grant non-qualified stock options to employees, excluding executive officers. Exercisability, option price and other terms are determined by the Board but the option price shall not be less than
100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1998 Plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of October 31, 2003, 28,161,720 stock options
remain outstanding and 8,179,958 shares of common stock were reserved for future grants under this plan.

Under our 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan), 1,800,000 shares have been authorized for issuance. The Directors Plan
provides for automatic grants to each non-employee member of the Board upon initial appointment or election to the Board, upon reelection and for annual service on Board committees. The option price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market
value of those shares on the grant date. Under the Directors Plan, as originally adopted, new directors receive an option for 40,000 shares, vesting in equal installments over four years. In addition, each continuing director who is elected at an
annual meeting of stockholders receives an option for 20,000 shares and an additional option for 10,000 shares for each Board committee membership, up to a maximum of two committee service grants per year. In August 2003, the Board amended the
Directors Plan in order to reduce the size of the initial and committee grants to 30,000 and 5,000 shares, respectively. The annual and committee service option grants vest in full on the date immediately prior to the date of the annual meeting
following their grant. In the case of directors appointed to the Board between annual meetings, the annual and any committee grants are prorated based upon the amount of time since the last annual meeting. As of October 31, 2003, 1,168,492 stock
options remain outstanding and 110,346 shares of common stock were reserved for future grants under this plan.



We have assumed certain option plans in connection with business combinations. Generally, the options
granted under these plans have terms similar to our own options. The exercise prices of such options have been adjusted to reflect the relative exchange ratios. We do not intend to make future grants out of these option plans.

We monitor dilution related to our option program by comparing net option
grants in a given fiscal period to the number of shares outstanding. The dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for the fiscal period, net of options forfeited by employees leaving Synopsys, divided by the total outstanding
shares at the end of such fiscal period. The option dilution percentages were 0.9% and 3.4% for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.

A summary of the distribution and dilutive effect of options granted is as follows:

(1)

Total grants, net of returns and cancellations, include the cancellation of approximately 812,000 options from a former named executive officer. If these options had been excluded
from the calculation, the net grants for fiscal 2003 as a percentage of outstanding shares would have been 1.4%.

A summary of our option activity and related weighted-average exercise prices for fiscal 2003 is as follows:

As of October 31,
2003, a total of approximately 39.0 million, 53.2 million and 1.8 million shares were reserved for issuance under our 1992, 1998 and Directors Plans, respectively, of which 15.8 million shares were available for future grants. For additional
information regarding our stock option activity during fiscal 2002, please see Note 7 of our

Pre-approvals of Non-Audit Services by Audit Committee

Pursuant to Section 10A(i)(3) of the Exchange Act, during the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003, the Audit Committee pre-approved the following non-audit services to be performed by KPMG LLP, our independent auditors:

1.

Consultation relating to merger or liquidation of certain Synopsys foreign subsidiaries; and

2.

International tax planning and tax compliance services relating to certain foreign subsidiaries.



Factors That May Affect Future Results

Weakness or budgetary caution in the semiconductor and electronics industries would negatively impact our business.

The semiconductor and electronics industries experienced steep declines in
orders and revenue in 2001 and 2002, before recovering moderately in 2003. Further recovery is subject to significant risks, and these manufacturers have been cautious to adopt an improved outlook on demand for their products. Accordingly, they may
continue to constrain their EDA investments, and we cannot predict whether, or when, further recovery will translate into increased EDA investments. Should our customers and prospective customers remain cautious in their EDA purchases due to market
conditions or other factors, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.

The EDA industry is highly competitive, and competition may have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results.

We compete with other EDA vendors that offer a broad range of products and
services, such as Cadence Design Systems and Mentor Graphics Corporation, and with EDA vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process. We also compete with customers’ internally developed design
tools and capabilities. If we fail to compete effectively our business will be materially and adversely affected.

We compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features, post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other vendors’
products, price and payment terms. Additional competitive challenges include:

•

Technology in the EDA industry evolves rapidly. Accordingly, we must correctly anticipate and lead critical developments, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing
products, and successfully develop or acquire new products. If we fail to do so, competing technologies may reduce demand for our products and services or render them obsolete.

•

Our Galaxy Design Platform does not yet fully integrate the suite of Synopsys’ logic and physical design implementation products. The competitive offerings of Cadence and Magma
Design Automation are in some respects more integrated than our Galaxy Design Platform. To compete, we must further integrate our products in the Galaxy Design Platform, while at the same time continuing to improve the performance and functionality
of our individual products. This effort will continue to require significant engineering and development work. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to offer a competitive complete design flow to customers or that customers will accept
and adopt our platform.

•

Our new initiatives, such as the Galaxy Design and Discovery Verification Platforms and expanded IP and design-for-manufacturing products, face intense competition, and some cases
address emerging markets. Accordingly, it is difficult for us to predict the success of these products. In the past, we have introduced new products that failed to meet our revenue expectations. If we fail to expand revenue from our new initiatives
at the desired rate, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.

•

Price and payment terms have become increasingly important competitive factors. We are regularly agreeing to extended payment terms on our time-based licenses, negatively affecting
cash flow from operations.

•

Due to discounting by our competitors and other competitive factors, in certain situations we are aggressively discounting our products. As a result, average prices for our products
may decline. In the alternative, we may lose potential business where we believe that discounting is not in our interests. In either case, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.



Our revenue and earnings fluctuate, which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock
price to decline.

Many factors affect our revenue and
earnings, making it difficult to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period, including customer demand, license terms, and the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold. Accordingly, stockholders should not view our
historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance. If our financial results or targets do not meet investor and analyst expectations, our stock price could decline.

The following are some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over
several fiscal periods:

•

We license our products through a variety of license types. In upfront licenses we recognize revenue at the time of product shipment. In time-based licenses we recognize revenue
over time. Our revenue and earnings expectations over a number of fiscal periods assume a mix between upfront and time-based licenses. Changes in this mix due to customer demand, application of accounting rules regarding revenue recognition,
competitive pressures or other reasons could have a material adverse affect on our revenues and earnings. For example, a larger proportion of upfront licenses may increase revenue and earnings in a particular quarter, but not contribute revenues and
earnings in future fiscal periods. Conversely, a lower proportion of upfront license orders than we expect could have a material adverse affect on revenue and earnings for a particular quarter.

•

We frequently receive a significant proportion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. The delay of a single order, especially a large order,
could have a material adverse affect on our revenues and earnings.

•

Our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision. Accordingly, our
customers’ evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters. Further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approval or project starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget
cycles.

•

Our business is seasonal. Historically, our orders and revenue have been lowest in our first fiscal quarter, with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year
and the first quarter of the next fiscal year.

•

We base our operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue. Since only a small portion of our
expenses varies with revenue, any revenue shortfall causes a direct reduction in net income.

The decline in starts of new IC designs, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may have an adverse affect on the EDA industry, including demand for our products and services.

Technology innovations, such as system-on-a-chip designs and IC designs
with features of 130 nanometers and below, have substantially increased the complexity, cost and risk of designing and manufacturing ICs. These trends require semiconductor manufactures to purchase increasingly sophisticated EDA software and
pre-designed and pre-verified IP components, creating market opportunity for us. At the same time, they contribute, along with the downturn in the semiconductor industry in 2001 and 2002, to the following potentially long-term trends:

•

The number of starts of new IC designs has declined. New IC design starts are a key driver in the demand for EDA software.

•

Fewer new companies engaged in semiconductor design are being formed or funded. These companies are traditionally an important source of new business for us.



•

A number of partnerships and mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred, and more are likely. Partnerships and mergers can reduce the aggregate level of
purchases of EDA software, including our products and services, by the companies involved.

These trends, if sustained, could have an adverse effect on the EDA industry, including the demand for our products and services.

Businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we
project.

We have acquired a number of companies in recent
years, and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings, we may acquire additional companies. During fiscal 2002, we acquired Avant!, inSilicon and Co-Design. During fiscal 2003, we acquired Numerical, InnoLogic Systems, Inc.,
and the verification IP assets of Qualis, Inc. Bidding for future acquisitions may be intense, which may make it difficult for us to acquire additional companies at acceptable prices, if at all.

In addition to direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including:

•

Potential dilution of our earnings per share;

•

Problems in integrating the acquired products into our business;

•

Difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating those employees into our company;

•

Challenges in ensuring acquired products and the development practices of employees of acquired companies meet our quality standards;

•

Failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings;

•

Failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales;

•

Drain on management time for acquisition-related activities;

•

Adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships; and

•

Assumption of unknown liabilities.

While we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us, we can provide no assurances that any acquisition
will have a positive effect on our performance. Furthermore, if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we could be required to write down the goodwill associated with such product or technology; these writedowns,
if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Stagnation of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations or other international issues could adversely affect our performance.

During fiscal 2003, we derived 43% of our revenue from outside North America, as compared to 35% during fiscal 2002. Foreign sales are vulnerable to
regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions, including the effects of international political conflict and hostilities and the outbreak of diseases such as SARS. In particular, continued weakness in the telecommunications
equipment business would adversely impact many of our largest European-based customers and which would cause them to curtail their EDA investments. While our sales in Japan were relatively strong during fiscal 2003, the Japanese economy remains
generally weak and future growth is thus difficult to predict. Furthermore, achievement of our overall orders and revenue plans assume sales growth in the Asia Pacific region, which may not occur if growth in the rest of the world’s economies
does not accelerate.

Our operating results are subject to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, particularly the



Euro, and to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen. If the U.S. dollar should continue to weaken in fiscal 2004 relative to other currencies, particularly the
Euro, our revenues and operating results will be adversely affected. Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

A failure to recruit and retain key
employees would have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete.

To be successful, we must attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join Synopsys in connection with acquisitions. There are a limited number of qualified EDA and IC design
engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. Companies in the EDA industry and in the general electronics industry value experience at Synopsys. Accordingly, our employees, including employees who have joined Synopsys in connection
with acquisitions, are often recruited aggressively by our competitors, and to a lesser extent, our customers. In the past, we have had high employee turnover, which may recur in the future. Our failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and
managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We issue stock options as a key component of our overall compensation. Recently enacted regulations of the Nasdaq National Market regarding stockholder
approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult for us to grant stock options to employees in the future. In addition, the FASB and other regulatory bodies have proposed changes to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
that may require us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options. Because of these enacted and proposed changes, it is possible that we may in the future incur increased cash compensation costs
as a substitute for reduced stock option grants, may lose top employees to non-public, start-up companies or may generally find it more difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our
business.

Product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm
our reputation.

Despite extensive testing prior to
releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. Product errors could affect the
performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products, and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. Errors or delays in releasing new
products or new versions of products could cause us to lose revenues or market share, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could adversely affect our business and
operating results.

Failing to protect our proprietary technology would have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. To protect this technology we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide. We can provide
no assurances that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. Moreover, certain foreign countries
do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property; our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. If we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or
trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or
individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful.



From time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights.

Under our customer agreements and other license
agreements, in many cases we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights. As a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third
party rights. For example, we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to
vigorously pursue this defense.

These types of claims can
result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or
require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business.

We are subject to changes in financial accounting standards, which may affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business.

Accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the
subject of frequent interpretations, significantly effecting the way we license our products. As a result of the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the review of accounting policies by the SEC and national and international accounting standards
bodies, the frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate. Future changes in financial accounting standards, including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition, may have a significant effect on our reported results, including reporting
of transactions completed before the effective date of the changes.

The FASB and various federal legislative proposals have proposed changes to GAAP that may require us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options. Synopsys currently uses the intrinsic
value method to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to our employees. Under this standard, we generally do not consider stock option grants issued under our employee stock option plans to be compensation when the exercise price of
the stock option is equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. If any change to GAAP is adopted that requires us to adopt a different method of determining the compensation expense for our employee stock options, our reported results of
operations may be adversely affected.

An unfavorable government review of
our tax returns or changes in our effective tax rates could adversely affect our operating results.

Our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. We exercise judgment in determining
our worldwide provision for income taxes, and in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, we are undergoing an audit of our federal income taxes
for fiscal 2001. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in the audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and
accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, there could be a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

Computer viruses, intrusion attempts on our information technology infrastructure and
denial of service attacks could seriously disrupt our business operations.

Recently, “hackers” and others have created a number of computer viruses or otherwise initiated “denial of service” attacks on computer networks and systems. Our information technology
infrastructure is regularly subject to various attacks and intrusion efforts of differing seriousness and sophistication. While we diligently maintain our information technology infrastructure and continuously implement protections against such
viruses



or intrusions, if our defensive measures fail or should similar defensive measures by our customers fail, our business could be materially and adversely
affected.

We have adopted anti-takeover provisions, which may delay or
prevent changes in control of management.

We have a number
of provisions that could have anti-takeover effects. In 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a Preferred Shares Rights Plan, commonly referred to as a “poison pill.” In addition, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further
action by our stockholders, to issue additional shares of common stock, to fix the rights and preferences of authorized but undesignated shares of preferred stock, and to issue shares of such preferred stock. These and other provisions of
Synopsys’ Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may deter hostile takeovers or delay or prevent changes in control of Synopsys management, including transactions in which Synopsys’
stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.

If export controls affecting our products are expanded, our business will be adversely affected.

The U.S. Department of Commerce regulates the sale and shipment of certain technologies by U.S. companies to foreign countries. To date, we believe we
have successfully complied with applicable export regulations. However, if the U.S. Department of Commerce places significant export controls on our existing, future or acquired products, our business would be materially and adversely affected.

Terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our financial condition
and results of operations.

Terrorist acts or acts of war
(wherever located around the world) may damage or disrupt Synopsys, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, or customers or cause unpredictable swings in foreign currency exchange rates, all of which could significantly impact our results of
operations and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other acts of war or hostility have created
many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways we cannot presently predict. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by acts of war.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment
portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents
and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of our investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit
exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument.

The
following table presents the carrying value and related weighted-average total return for our investment portfolio. The carrying value approximates fair value as of October 31, 2003. In accordance with our investment policy, the weighted-average
maturities of our total invested funds do not exceed one year.

As of October 31,
2003, the stated maturities of our current investments are $36.6 million within one year, $84.0 million within one to five years, $13.8 million within five to ten years and $39.6 million after ten years. These investments are generally classified as
available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Realized gains and losses on sales of short-term
investments have not been material.

Our strategic investment
portfolio consists of minority equity investments in publicly traded companies and investments in privately held companies. The securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive
income in stockholders’ equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. These securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

II, Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

for additional information on investment maturity dates, long-term debt and equity price risk related to our long-term investments and carrying value and write-downs of our strategic
investments.

Foreign Currency
Risk.

The functional currency of each of Synopsys’ foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency, except for our principal Irish subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. At the
present time, we hedge only (i) those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, and (ii) forecasted accounts receivable, backlog and accounts payable denominated in non-functional
currencies. Our hedging activities are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on the value of these balances. The success of these activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of balances denominated in various currencies.
We do not attempt to hedge operating expenses denominated in any foreign currency. Looking forward, to the extent our estimates of various balances denominated in non-functional currencies prove inaccurate, then we will not be completely hedged, and
we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. We can provide no assurances that our hedging transactions will be effective.



Foreign currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in
that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We have limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk. Furthermore, we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial
institution. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes.

Effective May 4, 2003, we changed the functional reporting currency of our principal Irish subsidiary from the Euro to the U.S. dollar because an increasing percentage of that subsidiary’s sales in Europe and
Asia, and the resulting accounts receivable, are denominated in U.S. dollars. The expenses of our Irish subsidiary, which manages all of our European offices, are predominantly in Euros. The accounts receivable and the expenses of our Japanese
subsidiary are denominated in yen.

The following table
provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2003. Due to the short-term nature of these contracts, the contract rates approximate the weighted-average currency exchange rates as of October 31, 2003. These forward
contracts mature in approximately thirty days, and contracts are rolled forward on a monthly basis to match firmly committed transactions.

Net unrealized gains
of approximately $19.3 million and $10.0 million, net of tax on the outstanding forward contracts, as of October 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet. Net
unrealized losses, net of tax on the outstanding forward contracts, as of October 31, 2001 were not material. Net cash inflows on maturing forward contracts during fiscal 2003 were $37.7 million.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Description of Business

Synopsys, Inc. (Synopsys or the Company) is the world
market leader in electronic design automation (EDA) software for semiconductor design. The Company delivers technology-leading semiconductor design and verification platforms to global electronics companies enabling development of complex
systems-on-a-chip (SoCs). Synopsys also provides intellectual property and design services to simplify the design process and to accelerate time to market for its customers.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year End.

The Company has a fiscal year that ends on the Saturday nearest October 31.
Fiscal 2003 and 2002 were 52-week years and fiscal 2001 was a 53-week year. Fiscal 2004 will be a 52-week year. For presentation purposes, the consolidated financial statements and notes refer to the calendar month end.

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency except for the Company’s principal Irish subsidiary, whose functional currency is the United States (U.S.) dollar. Non-functional currency monetary balances are remeasured into the
functional currency of the subsidiary with any related gain or loss recorded in earnings. The Company translates assets and liabilities of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The Company
translates income and expense items at average exchange rates for the period. Accumulated net translation adjustments are reported in stockholders’ equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Use of Estimates.

To prepare financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Fair Values of Financial
Instruments.

The fair value of the Company’s cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, long-term investments, forward contracts relating to certain investments in equity securities, accounts payable,
long-term debt and foreign currency contracts, approximates the carrying amount, which is the amount for which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments.

The Company classifies investments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired as cash equivalents. All of the Company’s cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. The Company has cash equivalents and investments with various high quality institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
institution.

Concentration of Credit
Risk.

The Company sells its products worldwide primarily to customers in the global electronics market. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not
require collateral. The Company establishes reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been within management’s expectations and have not been material in any year.



Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Sales Returns.

The Company establishes
reserves for potential credit losses including a specific reserve for any particular receivable when collectibility is not probable. In addition, the Company provides a general reserve on all accounts receivable based on a specified range of
percentages of the outstanding balance in each aged group. Such losses have been within management’s expectations and have not been material in any year. The following table provides a rollforward of the changes in the allowance for doubtful
accounts and sales returns.

(1)

Accounts written off, net of recoveries.

Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Assets are depreciated using the straight-line method
over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease or the economic useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The cost
of repairs and maintenance is charged to operations as incurred and was $15.1 million, $11.9 million and $10.5 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A detail of property and equipment is as follows:

Software
Development Costs.

Capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which is generally the completion of a working prototype. Software development costs capitalized
were $2.6 million, $1.6 million and $1.0 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Amortization of software development costs is computed based on the straight-line method over the software’s estimated economic life of approximately
two years. The Company recorded amortization of $1.6 million, $1.1 million and $1.0 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.



Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill represents the excess of the
aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by the Company. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer installed base/relationship, trademarks
and tradenames, covenants not to compete, customer backlog and capitalized software

.

Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from three to ten years. Amortization of intangible
assets was $123.2 million, $61.1 million and $17.0 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In fiscal 2002, the Company recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $3.8 million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with
prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value. Approximately $3.7 million and $0.1 million are included in integration expense and amortization of intangible assets, respectively, on the statement of operations. The impairment charge is primarily
attributable to certain technology acquired from and goodwill related to the acquisition of Stanza, Inc. (Stanza) in 1999. The Company determined that it would not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology as
products offered by Avant! Corporation (Avant!) provide customers with similar capabilities as well as additional functionality. As a result, the Company does not anticipate any future sales of the Stanza product.

In fiscal 2001, the Company recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $2.2
million to reduce the amount of certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions to their estimated fair value. Approximately $1.8 million and $0.4 million are included in cost of revenues and amortization of intangible assets,
respectively, on the statement of operations. The impairment charge is attributable to certain technology acquired from and goodwill related to the acquisition of Eagle Design Automation, Inc. (Eagle) in 1997. The Company determined that it would
not allocate future resources to assist in the market growth of this technology. As a result, the Company does not anticipate any future sales of the Eagle product.

Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities consist of:

Deferred
Compensation Plan.

The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan (the Plan) which permits certain employees to defer up to 50% of their annual cash base compensation or 100% of their annual cash variable compensation.
Distributions from the Plan are generally payable upon cessation of employment over five to 15 years or as a lump sum payment at the option of the employee. Undistributed amounts under the Plan are subject to the claims of the Company’s
creditors. As of October 31, 2003 and 2002, the invested amounts under the Plan total $31.3 million and $22.8 million, respectively, and are recorded as a long-term asset on the Company’s balance sheet. As of October 31, 2003 and 2002, the
Company has recorded $32.5 million and $22.9 million, respectively, as a long-term liability to recognize undistributed amounts due to employees.

Stock Split.

On September 23, 2003, the Company completed a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. All
common share and per share data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.



Other Comprehensive Income

.    The Company records comprehensive income in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income

, which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive net income and its components in the financial statements.
Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources, such as accumulated net translation adjustments, unrealized gains on certain foreign currency forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges
and reclassification adjustments related to unrealized gains on investments. Reclassification adjustments decrease other comprehensive income for gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities realized during the current year and are included in
other comprehensive income as unrealized holding gains in the period in which such unrealized gains arose.

Revenue Recognition

.    Synopsys has designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with Statement of
Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions, and SOP 98-4, Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition.

With respect to software sales,
Synopsys utilizes three license types:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

, which are for a finite term, on average approximately three years, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or
to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Post-contract customer support (maintenance or PCS) is bundled for the term of the license and not charged for separately.

•

Term licenses

, which are also for a finite term, usually two to three years, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for,
unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

•

Perpetual licenses

, which continue as long as the customer renews maintenance, plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to
receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. The annual maintenance fee for purchases under $2 million is typically calculated as a
percentage of the list price of the licensed software; for purchases over $2 million, the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

The Company reports revenue in three categories: upfront license revenue,
time-based license revenue and services.

Upfront license
revenue includes:

•

Perpetual licenses

.    The Company recognizes the perpetual license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment terms require the customer to
pay at least 75% of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment.

•

Upfront term licenses

.    The Company recognizes the term license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment terms require the customer to pay
at least 75% of the term license fee within one year from shipment.

Time-based license revenue includes:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses

.    The Company typically recognizes revenue from TSL license fees (which include bundled maintenance)
ratably over the term of the license period. However, where extended payment terms (as discussed below) are offered under the license arrangement, the



Company recognizes revenue from TSL license fees in an amount that is the lesser of the ratable portion of the entire fee or customer installments as they
become due and payable.

•

Term Licenses with Extended Payment Terms

.    For term licenses where less than 75% of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment, the
Company recognizes revenue as customer installments become due and payable.

Services revenue includes:

•

Maintenance Fees Associated with Perpetual and Term Licenses

.    The Company generally recognizes revenue from maintenance associated with perpetual and
term licenses ratably over the maintenance term.

•

Consulting and Training Fees

.    The Company generally recognizes revenue from consulting and training services as services are performed.

The Company allocates revenue on software
arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements. The Company’s determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective
evidence (VSOE). The Company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately.

The Company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple-element arrangements and determined that it has sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue
to the maintenance components of its perpetual and term license products and to consulting. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue from perpetual and term licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual
method in accordance with SOP 98-9 and revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.

Customers occasionally request the right to convert their existing TSLs to perpetual licenses. Customers pay an incremental fee to convert the TSL to a
perpetual license, which the Company recognizes upon contract signing, in accordance with AICPA Technical Practice Aid (TPA) 5100.74, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In some situations, the contract converting the TSL
to a perpetual term license is modified to such an extent that a new arrangement exists. The changes to the contract may include increases or decreases in the total technology under license, changes in payment terms, changes in license terms and
other pertinent factors. In these situations, the Company accounts for all of the arrangement fees as a new sale and recognizes revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company has a policy that defines the specific
circumstances under which such transactions are accounted for as a new perpetual license sale.

The Company makes significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving its products (referred to as an “arrangement” in the accounting
literature), the Company must evaluate whether: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) its fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is probable. The Company applies these criteria as
discussed below.

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists

.    The Company’s customary practice is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and the
Company, or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement.

•

Delivery Has Occurred

.    The Company delivers software to its customers physically or electronically. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer
terms are typically FOB shipping point. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when the Company provides the customer access codes, or “keys,” that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware.



•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable

.    The Company’s standard payment terms require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year.
Where these terms apply, the Company regards the fee as fixed or determinable, and the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery (assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the payment terms do not meet this standard, which we refer to
as “extended payment terms,” we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed
or determinable, due to application of other revenue accounting guidelines.

•

Collectibility is Probable

.    To recognize revenue, the Company must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees, which it does on a
customer-by-customer basis pursuant to its credit review policy. The Company typically sells to customers with whom it has a history of successful collection. For a new customer, the Company evaluates the customer’s financial position and
ability to pay and typically assigns a credit limit based on that review. The Company increases the credit limit only after it has established a successful collection history with the customer. If the Company determines at any time that
collectibility is not probable based upon its credit review process or the customer’s payment history, the Company recognizes revenue on a cash-collected basis.

Earnings Per Share.

The Company computes basic earnings per share using the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company computes diluted earnings per share using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive stock options outstanding during the period; the number of weighted-average
dilutive stock options outstanding is computed using the treasury stock method. Due to the net loss incurred for fiscal 2002, the effect of employee stock options is anti-dilutive in that period.

The table below reconciles the weighted-average common shares used to
calculate basic net income per share with the weighted-average common shares used to calculate diluted net income per share.

The effect of dilutive
employee stock options excludes approximately 12.0 million, 56.0 million and 7.6 million stock options for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which were anti-dilutive for net income per share calculations.

Stock-Based Compensation.

As permitted by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, the Company has elected to use the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to employees. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes no compensation expense with respect to stock-based awards to employees as awards are
issued with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the common stock on the grant date. The Company has determined pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share as if the Company had accounted for employee stock options under
the fair value method as required by SFAS No. 123. The fair value of these stock-based awards to employees was



estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and using the following weighted-average assumptions:

For pro forma
purposes, the estimated fair value of the Company’s stock-based awards to employees is amortized over the options’ vesting period of four years and the ESPP’s six-month purchase period. The weighted-average estimated fair value of
stock options issued during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $13.06, $12.87 and $12.81 per share, respectively. The weighted-average estimated fair value of share purchase rights under the ESPP during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $6.16, $7.49 and
$6.16 per share, respectively. The Company’s pro forma net income and earnings per share data under SFAS No. 123 is as follows:

Foreign Currency
Contracts.

The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign
currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions. These foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value, have a duration of approximately 30 days and are denominated primarily in
the Euro and the Japanese yen. As of October 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company had $143.1 million, $305.1 million and $72.2 million, respectively, of short-term foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. The contract value approximates fair
value.

The components of the Company’s foreign currency
forward contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as cash flow hedges, with gains and losses recorded in stockholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted transactions occur. As of October 31,
2003, an unrealized gain of approximately $19.3 million is recorded in stockholders’ equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the
variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately three years.



Hedging effectiveness is evaluated monthly using spot rates, with any gain or loss caused by hedging
ineffectiveness reclassified to earnings as other income (expense). The premium/discount component of the forward contracts is amortized to other income (expense) and is not included in evaluating hedging effectiveness.

The earnings impact of gains and losses on foreign currency forward
contracts, net of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, was immaterial for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001.

Effective May 4, 2003, the Company changed the functional reporting currency of its principal Irish subsidiary to the U.S. dollar from the Euro because an
increasing percentage of its sales in Europe and Asia, and the resulting accounts receivable are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Effect of New Accounting Standards.

In
May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 (SFAS 150),

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equit

y. SFAS 150
establishes standards to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective
at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS 150 is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the
statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption. The Company adopted SFAS 150 as of the beginning of its fourth quarter. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB
issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 (SFAS 149),

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

SFAS 149 is
generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

. Variable interest entities are created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or
other transactions or arrangements. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

, defines a variable interest entity and provides guidelines on identifying and assessing an enterprise’s
interests in a variable interest entity in order to determine whether to consolidate that entity. Generally, FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains
an interest after that date. For existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, the provision of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first
interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 148 (SFAS 148),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

—

Transition and Disclosure

. SFAS 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, to provide alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the



method used on reported results. The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. The interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2003.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

, which clarifies disclosure and recognition/measurement requirements related to
certain guarantees. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after December 15, 2002, and the recognition/measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. We typically warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days. We also indemnify our customers from third party claims of intellectual
property infringement relating to the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these guarantees have not been significant, and we are unable estimate the potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations.

In July 2001, the FASB issued Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. The Company adopted SFAS 142 on November 1, 2002 and ceased amortizing goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to July 1, 2001. In addition, as of
November 1, 2002, the Company assessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets recorded on the balance sheet and also tested goodwill for impairment per SFAS 142. In the Company’s impairment analysis, Synopsys
determined it has one reporting unit. The Company completed the goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of fiscal 2003 and found no indicators of impairment. This impairment review was based on the fair value of the Company as determined by
its market capitalization. All remaining and future acquired goodwill will be subject to an impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. As of October 31, 2003, unamortized goodwill was $550.7 million, which, in accordance with SFAS
142, the Company will not amortize.

Note 3. Business Combinations and
Divestitures

Purchase
Combinations.

During fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company made a number of purchase acquisitions. There were no purchase transactions during fiscal 2001. For each acquisition, the excess of the purchase price over the
estimated value of the net tangible assets acquired was allocated to various intangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technology, customer- and contract-related assets and goodwill. The values assigned to developed technologies related
to each acquisition were based upon future discounted cash flows related to the existing products’ projected income streams. The amounts allocated to purchased in-process research and development were determined through established valuation
techniques in the high-technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed.

Pro forma results of operations are presented only for certain material acquisitions since the effects of the remaining
fiscal 2003 and 2002 acquisitions are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each
business from the date of acquisition.

Fiscal 2003 Acquisitions

Numerical Technologies, Inc.
(Numerical)

.    On March 1, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Numerical.

Reasons for the Acquisition

.    In approving the merger, management considered a number of factors, including its opinion that
combining Numerical’s subwavelength, lithography-enabling solutions with Synopsys’ leading integrated circuit (IC) design solutions would enable Synopsys to further reduce costs and manufacturing risk for its customers as they create
smaller, faster and more power-efficient ICs. The foregoing discussion of the



information and factors considered by the Board of Directors (the Board) is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by the
Board.

Purchase Price

.    The
Company paid Numerical common stock holders $7.00 in cash in exchange for each share of Numerical common stock owned as of the merger date, or approximately $240.2 million. The total purchase consideration consisted of:

Acquisition-related
costs of $10.0 million consisted primarily of legal and accounting fees of $2.7 million and other directly related charges including $5.2 million in restructuring costs and $1.6 million in directors and officers liability insurance costs incurred to
cover Numerical’s former officers and Board of Directors as required by the merger agreement. As of October 31, 2003, the Company had paid $8.3 million of the acquisition-related costs and $0.4 million of the original accrual was reversed. Of
the balance remaining of $1.3 million as of October 31, 2003, $0.9 million represents facilities closure costs.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for Numerical and the estimated amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

(1)

Estimated useful life is 3 years.

(2)

Estimated useful life is 6 years.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Numerical merger, will not be amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. Except for amortization of the core/developed technology and backlog (which are included in cost of revenue
in the statement of operations for fiscal 2003), the Company includes amortization of the intangible assets in operating expenses in its statement of operations.



Unaudited Pro Forma Results of Operations

.    The following table presents pro
forma results of operations and gives effect to the Numerical acquisition as if the acquisition was consummated at the beginning of fiscal 2002. The Company has not included the effect of its other fiscal 2003 acquisitions as if the acquisitions
were consummated at the beginning of fiscal 2002 because the effects of these acquisitions were not material. The Company’s results of operations may have been different than those shown below if the Company had actually acquired Numerical at
the beginning of fiscal 2002. Pro forma results below do not necessarily indicate future operating results.

(1)

Fiscal 2002 pro forma results of operations and fiscal 2003 pro forma results of operations for the period from November 1, 2002 through February 28, 2003 include Numerical’s
reported revenue in the periods Numerical recognized such revenues. However, the purchase method of accounting requires Synopsys to reduce Numerical’s reported deferred revenue to an amount equal to the fair value of the legal liability,
resulting in lower revenue in periods following the merger than Numerical would have achieved as a separate company. Therefore, revenues from Numerical products for the period from March 1, 2003 to October 31, 2003 included in the pro forma results
of operations reflect the lower amortization of deferred revenue stemming from this purchase accounting adjustment.

(2)

Pro forma net income for fiscal 2003 includes in-process research and development costs of $19.9 million from fiscal 2003 acquisitions.

(3)

The calculations of the weighted-average common shares outstanding and weighted-average common shares and dilutive stock options outstanding for fiscal 2002 includes the impact of
the shares issued in the acquisition of Avant! as of the acquisition date as discussed below.

Other Fiscal 2003 Acquisitions

.    During fiscal 2003, the Company completed two additional acquisitions for aggregate
consideration consisting of $8.8 million in upfront payments and acquisition expenses and contingent consideration totaling $3.5 million based on the achievement of certain milestones as outlined in the merger agreements. In-process research and
development expenses associated with these acquisitions totaled $1.6 million for fiscal 2003. These acquisitions are not considered material to the Company’s balance sheet and results of operations.

Fiscal 2002 Acquisitions

Avant! Corporation

.

On June 6, 2002,
the Company completed its acquisition of Avant!.

Reasons
For the Acquisition

.    The Board unanimously approved the merger with Avant! at its December 1, 2001 meeting. In approving the merger agreement, the Board consulted with legal and financial advisors as well as with
management and considered a number of factors. These factors included the fact that the merger was expected to enable Synopsys to offer its customers a complete end-to-end solution for system-on-chip design that combines Synopsys’ logic
synthesis and design verification tools with Avant!’s advanced place and route, physical verification and design integrity products, thus increasing customers’ design efficiencies. By increasing customer design efficiencies, Synopsys
expected to be able to better compete for customers designing the next generation of semiconductors. Further, by gaining access to Avant!’s physical design and verification products, as well as its broad customer base and relationships,
Synopsys would gain new opportunities to market its existing products. The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors the Board considered.



Purchase Price

.    Holders of Avant! common stock received 0.371 of a share of
Synopsys’ common stock (including the associated preferred stock rights) in exchange for each share of Avant! common stock owned as of the closing date, aggregating 14.5 million shares of Synopsys common stock. The fair value of the
Synopsys’ shares issued was based on a per share value of $54.74, which was equal to Synopsys’ average last sale price per share as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the trading-day period two days before and after December 3,
2001, the date of the merger agreement.

The total purchase
consideration consists of the following:

Acquisition-related
costs consist of the following:

(1)

During fiscal 2002, additions were made to increase the total acquisition related costs including an increase to employee severance costs of $0.6 million for actual amounts paid to
such employees.

(2)

Synopsys settled claims of one of the two landlords of these buildings during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 for $7.4 million, and settled the claims of the other landlord during
the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for $15.0 million. Resolving these contingencies reduced the amount allocated to liabilities and goodwill by $31.6 million.

As of October 31, 2003, $116.6 million of costs have been paid. The remaining acquisition-related costs of $2.3 million
consist primarily of liquidation fees.

Facilities closure
costs at the closing date include $54.2 million related to Avant!’s corporate headquarters. After the merger, Synopsys consolidated the functions performed in the buildings into its corporate facilities. The lessors brought a claim against
Avant! for the future amounts payable under the lease agreements. The amount accrued at the closing date was equal to the future amounts payable under the related lease agreements, without taking into consideration in the accrual any defenses the
Company may have had to the claim. Synopsys settled the claims of one of the two landlords of these buildings during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 for $7.4 million, and settled the claims of the other landlord during the second quarter of fiscal
2003 for $15.0 million. Resolving these contingencies reduced the amount allocated to liabilities and goodwill by $31.6 million. The $0.6 million remaining facilities closure cost is the present value of the future obligations under certain of
Avant!’s other lease agreements which the Company has or intends to terminate under an approved facilities exit plan, plus additional costs the Company expects to incur directly related to vacating such facilities.

Employee severance costs include (i) $39.6 million in cash paid to
Avant!’s Chairman of the Board, consisting of severance plus a cash payment equal to the intrinsic value of his in-the-money stock options at the closing date, (ii) $5.1 million in cash severance payments paid to redundant employees (primarily
sales and corporate infrastructure personnel) terminated on or subsequent to the consummation of the merger under an



approved plan of termination, and (iii) $6.3 million in termination payments to certain executives in accordance with their respective pre-merger employment
agreements. The total number of Avant! employees terminated as a result of the merger was approximately 250.

Other acquisition-related costs of $37.4 million consist primarily of banking, legal and accounting fees, printing costs and other directly related
charges including contract termination costs of $6.3 million.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for Avant! and the estimated amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

(1)

Estimated useful life is 3 years.

(2)

Estimated useful life is 6 years.

(3)

Estimated useful life ranges from 2 to 4 years depending on life of the related agreement.

The initial allocation of the purchase price included certain assets and liabilities recorded using preliminary estimates of
fair value. During fiscal 2002, the value assigned to Avant!’s investment in a venture capital fund was reduced from the preliminary value of $12.8 million to $5.0 million upon obtaining additional information on the venture fund’s
non-public investments and subsequent sale of the investment to a third party. The decrease in the fair value of the investment increased the consideration allocated to goodwill by $7.8 million. During fiscal 2002, the Company also increased the
value of the acquired customs and use-tax liabilities by $2.5 million, resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill.

Asset Held for Sale.

As a result of the merger, Synopsys acquired Avant!’s physical libraries business, and Synopsys
was obligated to offer and sell such business to Artisan Components, Inc. (Artisan) under the terms of a January 2001 non-compete agreement, under which Synopsys agreed not to engage, directly or indirectly, in the physical libraries business before
January 3, 2003. As of the closing date, the value allocated to the acquired libraries business had been recorded as net assets held for sale, based on the estimated future net cash flows from



the libraries business in accordance with EITF 87-11,

Allocation of Purchase Price to Assets to Be Sold.

During fiscal 2002, management determined
that the libraries business would not be sold and, accordingly, allocated the fair value of the libraries business as of the closing date to the underlying tangible assets and intangible assets. The fair value allocated to the tangible and
intangible assets was $8.3 million, with the remaining fair value allocated to goodwill. This allocation is reflected in the balance sheet as of October 31, 2002.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over
the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the merger, will not be amortized, consistent with the guidance in SFAS 142 (see Note 2). The goodwill associated with the Avant! merger is not deductible for tax
purposes.

Contract Rights
Intangible

.    Avant! had executed signed license agreements and delivered the initial configuration of licensed technologies under ratable license arrangements, and had executed signed contracts to provide maintenance
over a one- to three-year period, for which Avant! did not consider the fees to be fixed and determinable at the outset of the arrangement. There were no receivables or deferred revenues recorded on Avant!’s historical financial statements at
the closing date as the related payments were not yet due under extended payment terms and deliveries are scheduled to occur over the terms of the arrangements. These ratable licenses and maintenance arrangements require future performance by both
parties and, as such, represent executory contracts. The contract rights intangible asset associated with these arrangements is being amortized to cost of revenue over the related contract lives of three years.

The amortization of intangible assets, with the exception of the contract
rights intangible and core/developed technology, is included in operating expenses in the statement of operations for fiscal 2003 and 2002. Amortization of core/developed technology and contract rights intangible is included in cost of revenue.

Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (Cadence)
Litigation

.    At the time of the acquisition of Avant!, Avant! was engaged in civil litigation with Cadence regarding alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, among other things, by Avant! and certain individuals.

In connection with the merger, Synopsys entered into a policy
with a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc., a AAA-rated insurance company, whereby insurance was obtained for certain compensatory, exemplary and punitive damages, penalties and fines and attorneys’ fees arising out of pending
litigation between Avant! and Cadence. The policy did not provide coverage for litigation other than the Avant!/Cadence litigation.

The Company paid a total premium of $335.8 million for the policy, of which $240.8 million was contingently refundable. The balance of the premium paid to
the insurer of $95.0 million was included in integration expense for fiscal 2002. Under the policy, the insurer was obligated to pay covered loss up to a limit of liability equaling (i) $500.0 million plus (ii) interest accruing at the fixed rate of
2%, compounded semi-annually, on $250.0 million (the interest component), as reduced by previous covered losses. Interest earned on $250.0 million was included in other income, net in the post-merger consolidated statement of operations for fiscal
2002.

On November 13, 2002, Cadence and Synopsys reached a
settlement of the litigation. Under the terms of the agreement, Synopsys paid Cadence $265.0 million in two installments—$20.0 million on November 22, 2002 and $245.0 million on December 16, 2002. In addition, Cadence and Synopsys have entered
into reciprocal license arrangements covering the intellectual property at issue in the litigation. As a result of the payment, Synopsys has recognized expense of approximately $240.8 million, which equals the contingently refundable portion of the
insurance premium plus interest accrued on the refundable portion. This expense is included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal 2002.

Co-Design Automation, Inc. (Co-Design

).

On September 6, 2002, the Company completed its
acquisition of Co-Design.



Reasons for the Acquisition

.    In approving the merger agreement, management
considered a number of factors, including its belief that (i) the acquisition would help promote the development and adoption of the Superlog language, which Synopsys believes can increase designer productivity; (ii) the combination of
Co-Design’s technology with Synopsys’ high-level verification and design implementation tools was expected to improve the performance of Synopsys’ products; and (iii) the acquisition would give Synopsys access to Co-Design’s
highly-skilled employees who would help Synopsys improve its existing products and facilitate the development of new products. The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by Synopsys’ management is not intended to be
exhaustive but includes the material factors considered.

Purchase Price

.    Holders of Co-Design common stock received consideration consisting of cash and notes totaling $32.7 million in exchange for all shares of Co-Design common stock owned as of the merger date. The
total purchase consideration consisted of the following:

The
acquisition-related costs of approximately $1.0 million consisted primarily of legal and accounting fees. As of October 31, 2003, substantially all of these acquisition-related costs have been paid.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for
Co-Design and the estimated amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

(1)

Estimated useful life is 10 years.

Notes of $4.8 million are payable to former Co-Design shareholders, of which $1.9 million was included in integration expense in the statement of
operations for services performed in fiscal 2002 and the remainder was an element of the purchase price. An aggregate of $4.1 million of these notes will be paid in September 2007. The remaining notes are subject to prepayment in September 2004 if
certain milestones are met.

inSilicon Corporation
(inSilicon

).

On September 20, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of inSilicon.



Reasons for the Acquisition

.    In approving the merger agreement, management
considered a number of factors, including (i) the complementary nature of inSilicon’s portfolio of intellectual property blocks and Synopsys’ own portfolio; (ii) the fact that inSilicon had established a per-use license model for its IP
products, which was expected to accelerate Synopsys’ adoption of a per-use model for its new and development-stage IP; (iii) inSilicon’s relationships with chip design teams; (iv) inSilicon’s positive reputation as a vendor of
high-quality IP; and (v) inSilicon’s highly-skilled employee base. The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by Synopsys’ management is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered.

Purchase Price

.    Holders of
inSilicon common stock received $4.05 in exchange for each share of inSilicon common stock owned as of the merger date, or approximately $65.4 million. The total purchase consideration consisted of the following:

The
acquisition-related costs of $6.2 million consisted primarily of legal and accounting fees of $1.8 million, other directly related charges including contract termination costs of $3.3 million and restructuring costs of approximately $0.8 million. As
of October 31, 2003, substantially all of the acquisition related costs have been paid.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for inSilicon and the estimated amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

(1)

Estimated useful life is 3 years.



Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill, representing the excess of the
purchase consideration over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the merger will not be amortized, consistent with the guidance in SFAS 142 (see Note 2). The goodwill associated with the inSilicon acquisition is
not deductible for tax purposes.

The amortization of
intangible assets is included in cost of revenue in the statement of operations for fiscal 2003 and 2002. inSilicon had executed signed contracts with five of its major customers to provide IP licenses, including significant modifications to the IP
license in order to meet unique customer requirements. The value associated with these contracts was determined by quantifying the projected cash flow related to these contracts, discounted to present value, and is recorded as customer backlog in
intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Unaudited Pro Forma Results of Operations

.    The following table presents pro forma results of operations and gives effect to the Avant! and inSilicon acquisitions as if the acquisitions were consummated at the
beginning of fiscal 2002. The Company has not included the effect of its other fiscal 2002 acquisitions because the effects of these acquisitions were not material. The Company’s results of operations may have been different than those shown
below if the Company had actually acquired Avant! and inSilicon at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Pro forma results below do not necessarily indicate future operating results.

(1)

Fiscal 2002 pro forma results of operations for the period from November 1, 2002 to the date of acquisition include Avant! and inSilicon’s reported revenue in the periods
Avant! and inSilicon recognized such revenues. However, the purchase method of accounting requires Synopsys to reduce Avant! and inSilicon’s reported deferred revenue to an amount equal to the fair value of the legal liability, resulting in
lower revenue in periods following the merger than Avant! and inSilicon would have achieved as separate companies. Therefore, revenues from Avant! and inSilicon products for the period from the date of acquisition to October 31, 2002 included in the
pro forma results of operations reflect the lower amortization of deferred revenue stemming from this purchase accounting adjustment.

Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net

Goodwill for the years ended October 31, 2002 and 2003 consisted of the
following:

(1)

Additions include goodwill and intangible assets acquired as part of the Numerical acquisition, assets acquired as part of other acquisitions made during the fiscal year, contract
termination costs and amounts related to foreign currency fluctuations for goodwill which is not denominated in U.S. dollars.

(2)

Fiscal 2002 Acquisitions

above, offset by the reduction of $4.3 million in Avant!
unbilled receivables. These receivables relate to long-term library business service contracts under which Avant! had not yet performed services and, as such, represent executory contracts rather than unbilled receivables. The amount assigned to the
associated intangible asset was not material.

Intangible assets as of October 31, 2002 consisted of the following:

(1)

Total intangible assets do not include capitalized research and development, net of $1.6 million as of October 31, 2002.



Intangible assets as of October 31, 2003 consisted of the following:

(1)

Total intangible assets do not include capitalized research and development, net of $2.6 million as of October 31, 2003.

The following table reflects adjusted net income (loss) per share, excluding amortization of goodwill,
for fiscal 2002 and 2001 as if the Company had adopted SFAS 142 as of July 1, 2001. The Company’s actual results of operations are shown for fiscal 2003.

Note 5. Financial Instruments

Cash, Cash Equivalents and
Investments.

All cash equivalents, short-term investments and non-current investments have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are detailed as follows:

As of October 31,
2003, the stated maturities of the Company’s current investments are $36.6 million within one year, $84.0 million within one to five years, $13.8 million within five to ten years and $39.6 million after ten years. These investments are
generally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Realized gains and losses
on sales of short-term investments have not been material.



Strategic Investments.

The Company’s strategic investment portfolio
consists of minority equity investments in publicly traded companies and investments in privately held companies. The securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115),

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive
income in stockholders’ equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. These securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value.

During the years ended October 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company determined
that certain strategic investments, with an aggregate value of $7.1 million, $16.3 million and $9.4 million, respectively, were impaired and that the impairment was permanent. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $4.5 million,
$11.3 million and $5.8 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, to write down the carrying value of the investments.

Derivative Financial Instruments

.    Available-for-sale equity investments accounted for under SFAS 115 are subject to market
price risk. From time to time, the Company enters into and designates forward contracts to hedge variable cash flows from anticipated sales of these investments. In accounting for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion
of the change in fair value of the derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged anticipated transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the
derivative is recognized in earnings immediately.

The
Company’s objective for entering into derivative contracts is to lock in the price of selected equity holdings while maintaining the rights and benefits of ownership until the anticipated sale occurs. The forecasted sale selected for hedging is
determined by market conditions, up-front costs and other relevant factors. The Company has generally selected forward sale contracts to hedge its market price risk.

Changes in the spot rate of the forward sale contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of the forecasted sale
of available-for-sale investments accounted for under SFAS 115 are reported in other comprehensive income. The notional amount of the forward designated as the hedging instrument is equal to the available-for-sale securities being hedged. In
addition, hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the changes in spot prices. As such, the hedging relationship is perfectly effective, both at inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis. The difference between the contract price and the
forward price, which is generally not material, is reflected in other income.

The Company entered into forward sale contracts in fiscal 2001 and 2000 with a major financial institution for the sale of certain of the Company’s strategic investments. During fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, the
Company physically settled certain forward contracts. The net gain on the forward contracts was offset by the net loss on the related available-for-sale investment since inception of the hedge, with any gain or loss reclassified from other
comprehensive income to other income. As of October 31, 2003, there are no forward contracts outstanding.

Debt.

As of October 31, 2003, the Company’s debt totaled $7.2 million consisting primarily of $5.1 million for notes
payable related to acquisitions payable through 2007 and $1.5 million to secure bonds related to certain property taxes. As of October 31, 2002, the Company’s debt consisted of $0.1 million for equipment leases, $5.1 million for notes payable
related to acquisitions and $1.4 million to secure bonds related to certain property taxes.



Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company leases its domestic and foreign facilities and certain office equipment under operating leases. Rent expense was
$35.1 million, $33.7 million and $30.0 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In October 2003, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a portion of its office space by which it leases a building owned by it in Sunnyvale,
California to a third party through February 2009. The Company will receive monthly sublease payments of $150,000 beginning March 2004.

Future minimum lease payments on all facility operating leases, net of sublease income, as of October 31, 2003 are as follows:

(1)

Minimum lease payments exclude leases related to Avant! and Numerical facilities which the Company intends to terminate under its approved facilities exit plan as these payments are
included in the acquisition-related costs for the Avant! and Numerical acquisitions (see Note 3).

Note 7. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Repurchase Programs.

In July 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under
which Synopsys common stock with a market value up to $500 million may be acquired in the open market. This stock repurchase program replaced all prior repurchase programs authorized by the Board. The Company intends to use all common shares
repurchased for ongoing stock issuances such as existing employee stock option plans, existing stock purchase plans and acquisitions. The July 2001 stock repurchase program expired on October 31, 2002. In December 2002, the Company’s Board of
Directors renewed the stock repurchase program originally approved in July 2001 (see note 12). During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company purchased approximately 9.4 million shares at an average price of $27.72 per share, approximately 7.8
million shares at an average price of $22.10 per share, and approximately 13.2 million shares at an average price of $25.00 per share, respectively.

Preferred Shares Rights Plan

.    The Company has adopted a number of provisions that could have anti-takeover effects,
including a Preferred Shares Rights Plan. In addition, the Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by its shareholders, to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of authorized but undesignated shares of Preferred Stock.
This provision and other provisions of the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or
management of the Company, including transactions in which the stockholders of the Company might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. The preferred share rights expire on October 24, 2007.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Under the
Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the ESPP) an aggregate of 17,700,000 shares have been authorized for issuance as of October 31, 2003. Under the ESPP, employees are granted the
right to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at (i) the



beginning of a rolling two-year offering period or (ii) the end of each semi-annual purchase period. During fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 shares totaling
1,536,574, 1,255,882 and 1,134,508, respectively, were issued under the plan at average per share prices of $17.35, $16.93 and $16.60, respectively. As of October 31, 2003, 7,833,992 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the
plan.

Stock Option Plans.

Under
the Company’s 1992 Stock Option Plan (the 1992 Plan), 38,951,016 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1992 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant either incentive or non-qualified stock options to purchase
shares of common stock to eligible individuals at not less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1992 Plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire ten years from the date
of grant. As of October 31, 2003, 9,003,784 stock options remain outstanding and 7,479,776 shares of common stock are reserved for future grants under this plan.

Under the Company’s 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan), 53,247,068 shares of common stock have been
authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1998 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant non-qualified stock options to employees, excluding executive officers. Exercisability, option price and other terms are determined by the Board of Directors, but
the option price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1998 Plan generally vest over a period of four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. As of October
31, 2003, 28,161,720 stock options remain outstanding and 8,179,958 shares of common stock were reserved for future grants under this plan.

Under the Company’s 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan), 1,800,000 shares have been authorized for issuance. The
Directors Plan provides for automatic grants to each non-employee member of the Board of Directors upon initial appointment or election to the Board, upon reelection and for annual service on Board committees. The option price shall not be less than
100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Under the Directors Plan, as originally adopted, new directors receive an option for 40,000 shares, vesting in equal installments over four years. In addition, each continuing director
who is elected at an annual meeting of stockholders receives an option for 20,000 shares and an additional option for 10,000 shares for each Board committee membership, up to a maximum of two committee service grants per year. In August 2003, the
Board amended the Directors Plan to reduce the size of the initial and committee grants to 30,000 and 5,000 shares, respectively. The annual and committee service option grants vest in full on the date immediately prior to the date of the annual
meeting following their grant. In the case of directors appointed to the Board between annual meetings, the annual and any committee grants are prorated based upon the amount of time since the last annual meeting. As of October 31, 2003, 1,168,492
stock options remain outstanding and 110,346 shares of common stock were reserved for future grants under this plan.

The Company has assumed certain option plans in connection with business combinations. Generally, the options granted under these plans have terms similar
to the Company’s options. The exercise prices of such options have been adjusted to reflect the relative exchange ratios. The Company does not intend to make future grants out of these option plans.



Additional information concerning stock option activity under all plans is as follows:

The following table
summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of October 31, 2003:

Note 8. Income Taxes

The Company is entitled to a deduction for federal and
state tax purposes with respect to employees’ stock option activity. The net reduction in taxes otherwise payable arising from that deduction has been credited to additional paid-in capital.



The components of the Company’s total income (loss) before provision for income taxes are as
follows:

The components of the
provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows:

The provision
(benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount obtained by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes as follows:

Net deferred tax
assets of $241.0 million and $276.3 million were recorded as of October 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net deferred tax asset of $241.0 million for fiscal 2003 includes the tax effects of the parent corporation, the Company, and newly acquired
corporations, Numerical and InnoLogic Systems, Inc. The



tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

As of October 31,
2003, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.

The Company’s U.S. income tax return for fiscal 2001 is under examination. Management believes that adequate amounts
have been provided for any adjustments that may ultimately result from this examination.

The Company has federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately $230.5 million as of October 31, 2003 which includes a federal loss carryforward of approximately $75.4 million resulting from tax deductions in 2003
related to employee stock options. The loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2023. Because of the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of the Company’s loss carryforwards may be subject to annual
limitations. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization. Management believes that all net operating losses will be utilized, and a valuation allowance is not necessary. The tax benefit of federal
net operating losses attributable to employee stock options is credited directly to stockholder’s equity.

The Company has federal foreign tax credits of $33.1 million. If not utilized, $28.2 million of the foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2008,
and $4.9 million of the foreign tax credit carryforwards will begin to



expire in 2005. The Company has federal and California research and development credits of $14.6 million and $17.5 million, respectively. If not utilized,
the federal research and development credits will begin to expire in 2022. The Company has other state tax credits of $2.8 million that, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2006.

The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered
permanently invested outside of the U.S. As of October 31, 2003, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $176.7 million. As of October 31, 2003, the unrecognized deferred tax liability
for these earnings was approximately $49.1 million.

Note 9. Segment
Disclosure

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131 (SFAS 131),

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

, requires disclosures of certain information regarding operating segments, products and services, geographic areas of operation and major customers. SFAS
131 reporting is based upon the “management approach”: how management organizes the Company’s operating segments for which separate financial information (i) is available and (ii) is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision
Maker (CODM) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Synopsys’ CODMs are the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.

The Company provides software products and consulting services in the electronic design automation software industry. In
making operating decisions, the CODMs primarily consider consolidated financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region. The Company operates in a single segment. Revenue is defined as revenues from
external customers.

Revenue and long-lived assets related to
operations in the United States and other geographic areas were:

Geographic revenue
data for multi-region, multi-product transactions reflect internal allocations and is therefore subject to certain assumptions and to the Company’s methodology. Beginning in fiscal 2003, geographic revenue reflects reconfiguration of licenses
between different regions following the initial product shipment.

For management reporting purposes, we organize our products and services into five distinct groups: Galaxy Design Platform, Discovery Verification Platform, Intellectual Property (IP), New Ventures and Professional Services & Other. The
following table summarizes the revenue attributable to these groups as a percentage of



total revenue for the last twelve quarters. We include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition
date through the end of the relevant periods. For presentation purposes, we allocate maintenance, which represented approximately 18% of our total revenue and approximately 84% of our total services revenue for fiscal 2003, to the products to which
those support services relate. Further, with the adoption of our platform strategy in fiscal 2003, we redefined our product groups and have reclassified prior period revenues in accordance with this new grouping to provide a consistent presentation.

Beginning in fiscal
2003, product revenue reflects reconfiguration of licenses between different product categories following the initial product shipment.

No one customer accounted for more than ten percent of the Company’s consolidated revenue in the periods presented.

Note 10. Termination of Agreement to Acquire IKOS Systems, Inc.

On July 2, 2001, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
and Reorganization (the IKOS Merger Agreement) with IKOS Systems, Inc. (IKOS). The IKOS Merger Agreement provided for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of IKOS common stock by Synopsys.

On December 7, 2001, Mentor Graphics Corporation (Mentor) commenced a cash
tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of IKOS common stock at $11.00 per share, subject to certain conditions. On March 12, 2002, Synopsys and IKOS executed a termination agreement by which the parties terminated the IKOS Merger
Agreement and pursuant to which IKOS paid Synopsys the $5.5 million termination fee required by the IKOS Merger Agreement. This termination fee and $2.4 million of expenses incurred in conjunction with the acquisition are included in other income,
net on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 2002. Synopsys subsequently executed a revised termination agreement with Mentor and IKOS in order to add Mentor as a party thereto.

Note 11. Related Party Transactions

Revenues derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries in the
aggregate accounted for approximately 9.5% and 7.9% of fiscal 2003 and 2002 revenues, respectively. Andy D. Bryant, Intel Corporation’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer, also serves on the
Company’s Board of Directors. Management believes the transactions between the two parties were carried out on an arm’s length basis.

The Company has a joint venture with Davan Tech Co., Ltd, of Korea (Davan Tech) whereby Davan Tech acts as a non-exclusive distributor for the Company
subject to certain conditions as defined in the distribution agreement. As of October 31, 2003, the Company owned approximately 10% of Davan Tech, and the investment is accounted for under the cost basis. During fiscal 2003 and the period from June
6, 2002 through October 31, 2002, the Company recognized revenues totaling $3.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, from Davan Tech. Accounts receivable included $0.9 million and $3.7 million of receivable from Davan Tech as of October 31,



2003 and 2002, respectively. In December 2003, the Company terminated its distribution agreement with Davan Tech.

The Company maintains a System-on-a-Chip Venture Fund (the Fund) authorized
by the Company’s Board which invests in companies that will facilitate building SoCs. The fund is administered by an investment advisory board consisting of senior Company officers, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Operating Officer, and Dr. A. Richard Newton, a member of the Board. The Fund has invested $800,000 in a private company that develops SoC test systems. The Chairman of the Company’s Audit Committee, Deborah A. Coleman, is also the Chairman of
the Board for such company. Ms. Coleman did not participate in Fund’s investment decision.

During fiscal 2003 and 2002, Dr. A. Richard Newton, a member of Synopsys’ Board of Directors, provided consulting services to Synopsys and was paid
$180,000. Under Synopsys’ agreement with Dr. Newton, Dr. Newton provides advice, at Synopsys’ request, concerning long-term technology strategy and industry development issues as well as assistance in identifying opportunities for
partnerships with academia.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

.

As of October 31, 2003 (the Evaluation Date), Synopsys carried out an evaluation under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Synopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly,
even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving their control objectives. Subject to these limitations, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,
as of the Evaluation Date, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported as and when required.

Identification of Audit Committee and Financial Expert

Synopsys maintains an Audit Committee consisting of directors Ms. Coleman, Dr. Somekh and Mr. Vallee. All of such members satisfy the independence criteria of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. for serving on an audit
committee. SEC regulations require Synopsys to disclose whether a director qualifying as a “financial expert” serves on the Synopsys’ Audit Committee. Synopsys has determined that Ms. Coleman, Chairperson of the Audit Committee,
qualifies as a “financial expert” within the meaning of such regulations.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and greater than ten percent beneficial owners of our stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Directors,
executive officers and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish Synopsys with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.

Based solely on its review of the copies of the Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by or received from its reporting persons (or written
representations received from such persons), Synopsys believes that each of its directors, executive officers and greater than ten percent beneficial owners of its stock during fiscal 2003 complied with all filing requirements applicable to such
persons except that Sanjiv Kaul, Senior Vice President, New Ventures Group, filed a Form 4 late reporting one transaction as a result of the transition from paper to electronic filing requirements.

Adoption of Code of Ethics

Synopsys has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the Code)
applicable to all of its Board members, employees and executive officers, including its Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer), Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) and Vice President, Controller and Treasurer
(Principal Accounting Officer). Synopsys has made the Code available on its website at www.synopsys.com/corporate/governance.

Synopsys intends to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 10 of Form 8-K regarding (i) any amendments to the Code, or (ii) any waivers under the
Code relating to Synopsys’ Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, by posting such information on its website at www.synopsys.com/corporate/governance.

Director Compensation

Each member of the Board receives a retainer of $25,000 per year for attendance at Board meetings. Each member of the Audit Committee also receives $2,000
per Audit Committee meeting attended, other than the Chairperson, who receives $4,000 per Audit Committee meeting attended, in each case up to a maximum of four meetings per year.



Under our 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan), 1,800,000 shares have been
authorized for issuance. The Directors Plan provides for automatic grants to each non-employee member of the Board of Directors upon initial appointment or election to the Board, upon reelection and for annual service on Board committees. The option
price is 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date. Under the Directors Plan, as originally adopted, new directors received an option for 40,000 shares, vesting in equal installments over four years. In addition, each
continuing director who was reelected at an annual meeting of stockholders received an option for 20,000 shares and an additional option for 10,000 shares for each Board committee membership, up to a maximum of two committee service grants per year.
In August 2003, the Board amended the Directors Plan to reduce the size of the initial and committee grants to 30,000 and 5,000 shares, respectively. The annual and committee service option grants vest in full on the date immediately prior to the
date of the annual meeting following their grant. In the case of directors appointed to the Board between annual meetings, the annual and any committee grants are prorated based upon the amount of time since the last annual meeting.

During fiscal 2003, Ms. Coleman, Drs. Newton and Somekh and Messrs. Bryant,
Chizen, Walske and Vallee each received automatic grants of options to purchase 20,000 Synopsys common shares at an exercise price of $30.94 per share for Synopsys Board of Directors service during the year, and two grants of options to purchase
10,000 shares each at an exercise price of $30.94 per share for Synopsys Board of Directors Committee service during the year. Mr. Vallee, who joined the Board in February 2003, also received an option for 40,000 shares at an exercise price of
$20.46 for his initial service, a pro-rated annual grant of 6,666 shares at an exercise price of $20.46 per share, and two pro-rated committee grants for an aggregate of 6,666 shares at an exercise price of $20.23 per share.

Change of Control Agreements and Named Executive Officer Employment Contracts

Under the 1992 Stock Option Plan (1992 Plan), in the
event of certain changes in the ownership or control of Synopsys involving a “Corporate Transaction,” which includes an acquisition of Synopsys by merger or asset sale, each outstanding option under the 1992 Plan will automatically become
exercisable, unless the option is assumed by the successor corporation, or parent thereof, or replaced by a comparable option to purchase shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation or parent thereof.

In addition, in the event of a successful hostile tender offer for more than
50% of the outstanding Synopsys common shares or a change in the majority of the Board of Directors as a result of one or more contested elections for membership on the Board of Directors, the administrator of the 1992 Plan has the authority to
accelerate vesting of outstanding options or shares purchased under the 1992 Plan.

The Directors Plan provides that in the event of a change of control or corporate transaction, as such terms are defined in the Directors Plan, all outstanding Directors Plan options shall become fully vested and
exercisable as of the date of such change of control or corporate transaction.

Synopsys has entered into Employment Agreements, effective October 1, 1997, with its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its President and Chief Operating Officer. Each Employment Agreement provides that if the
executive is terminated involuntarily other than for cause within 24 months of a change of control, (a) the executive will be paid an amount equal to two times the sum of the executive’s annual base pay plus target cash incentive, plus the cash
value of the executive’s health benefits for the next 18 months, and (b) all stock options held by the executive will immediately vest in full. If the executive is terminated involuntarily other than for cause in any other situation, the
executive will receive a cash payment equal to the sum of the executive’s annual base pay for one year plus the target cash incentive for such year plus the cash value of the executive’s health benefits for 12 months. The terms
“involuntary termination,” “cause” and “change of control” are defined in the Employment Agreements, each of which is filed with the SEC.



Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

The members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2003 were, Ms. Coleman and Messrs. Bryant, Chizen and Walske.
Effective December 2003, the Compensation Committee consists of Ms. Coleman and Messrs. Chizen and Walske, all of whom satisfy the independence criteria of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. for serving on a compensation committee.

No Compensation Committee member was at any time during fiscal
2003, or at any other time, an officer or employee of Synopsys or any of its subsidiaries.

No executive officer of Synopsys serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on Synopsys’ Board of Directors or Compensation Committee.
