The Role of EDA in
the Electronics Industry

Technology advances
in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density,
speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors (also
referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips).

·

Since
the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires
imprinted on the chip that form the transistors) and other developments have
enabled IC manufacturers to follow “Moore’s law,” approximately doubling every
two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip.

·

Chips
have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more
powerful handheld devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, music players
and personal digital assistants.

·

Increasingly,
single Systems-on-a-Chip (SoCs) can handle functions formerly performed by
multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board.

Combined, these advances in semiconductor technology
have enabled the development of lower cost, higher performance computers,
wireless communications networks, hand held devices, internet routers and a
wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new
challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and
manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as
Synopsys.

These technological
challenges have been accompanied by unprecedented business challenges stemming
from the semiconductor downturn in 2000-2002, increased globalization
leading customers to source their products in lower cost areas, and consumer
demand for cheaper and more advanced products.

The IC Design
Process

EDA software enables designers to create complex
semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps
described below.

System
Design.

In
system design, the designer describes the chip’s desired functions in very
basic terms using a specialized high-level computer language, typically C

++

or System C. This phase yields a relatively
high level behavioral model of the chip.

Register
Transfer Level (RTL) Design.

RTL design is the process of capturing the intended
design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level
computer language, typically Verilog or VHDL.

Logic
Design.

Logic
design, or “synthesis,” programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of
the chip, and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various
groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip.

Functional
Verification.

At
the RTL level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools
such as RTL simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to
verify that the design will function as intended. The increasing size and
complexity of today’s ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort
required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to
70% of total design time. As a result, designers are demanding solutions that
can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds, and that can reduce
verification risk (i.e., find design bugs before designs are taken into
production).

Physical
Design.

In
the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of
the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with “place and route”
products. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each
block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each
block, a process known as “placement.” In many designs, placement is performed
in


conjunction with logic
synthesis, a process known as “physical synthesis.” After placement the
designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as “routing.”
With increasing gate counts and design complexity, seamless correlation among
physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important.

Physical
Verification.

Before
sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer
must perform a series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that
the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication
facility that will manufacture the chip.

Design
for Manufacturing.

The
design is then translated to a series of photomasks, or physical
representations of the design. IC manufacturers use photomasks to produce the
silicon wafer containing individual ICs. As IC wire or “feature” sizes shrink,
this translation is becoming more and more difficult. These challenges are
exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than
the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process, requiring
advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to
alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced. Technology
computer-aided design, or TCAD, tools are also used to model individual
features or “devices” within the design to help ensure manufacturability.
Finally, various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this
stage to increase the number of usable ICs contained on each silicon wafer.

Intellectual Property
Reuse.

As IC designs continue to grow in size
and complexity, designers have found that inserting pre-designed and
pre-verified design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help
reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip
elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified. Usually, such IP
blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ICs,
including microprocessors, digital signal processors, or connectivity IP that
support such protocols as USB, PCI Express or Ethernet.

Strategy

With increasing chip complexity, designers are finding
it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above
sequentially, and must repeat some steps, such as verification, multiple times
before finishing the design. Each such iteration can add significant costs and
makes it more difficult for the designer to meet time-to-market goals. Synopsys
addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product
platforms, enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as
the design moves from one step to the next.

In addition, smaller and smaller chip feature sizes
require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the
production process than ever before. Synopsys has invested heavily in design
for manufacturing tools and technologies that help ensure designs are still
able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an
acceptable yield.

Also, many hardware products contain increasingly
complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is
designed. We offer system-level products that permit designers to develop such
software earlier in the IC design process, speeding overall development time.

Finally, designers are
under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly
than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition. We address
this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality, pre-verified
standards-based and other IP, which designers can use to complete their design
faster and with greater confidence.

Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the People’s Republic of China, Singapore, South
Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Our foreign headquarters is
located in Dublin, Ireland. Our offices are further described under Part I,
Item 2.

Properties

.

In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, an aggregate of 49%,
49% and 45%, respectively, of Synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales
outside of the United States. Additional information relating to domestic and
foreign operations, including revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area,
is contained in Note 11 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

in Part II, Item 8.

risks associated with foreign operations is described in Part I, Item 1A.

Risk Factors- Stagnation of foreign economies,
foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our
operations could adversely affect our performance

and is incorporated by reference here.

Historically, our orders and revenue have been lowest
in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a material decline
between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first quarter of the next
fiscal year, although the timing of major license renewals can alter this
trend. Under our previous license model, revenue seasonality resulted
principally from the decline in the amount of upfront orders from the fourth
quarter of one fiscal year to the first quarter of the next fiscal year.
However, as a result of the shift in our license model, as more fully described
in Part II, Item 7.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

,
we experienced significantly less revenue seasonality during fiscal 2005 and
2006 and we expect revenue seasonality to be minimal in the foreseeable future,
although orders seasonality may continue.

Synopsys’ aggregate backlog was approximately $2.01
billion on October 31, 2006, representing a 4% increase from backlog of
$1.92 billion on October 31, 2005. Aggregate backlog includes deferred
revenue, operational backlog and financial backlog. Deferred revenue represents
that portion of orders for software products, license maintenance and other
services which have been delivered and billed to the customer but on which the
revenue has not yet been recognized. Operational backlog consists of orders for
software products and maintenance that have not been shipped and orders for
consulting services that have not yet been performed and accepted. Financial
backlog consists of future installments not yet due and payable under existing
time-based licenses and maintenance contracts.

We have not historically experienced material order
cancellations.


The
following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our five product groups
established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue
for the last three fiscal years. We include revenue from companies or products
we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through
the end of the relevant periods. For presentation purposes, we allocate
maintenance revenue, which represented approximately 9%, 14% and 16% of our
total revenue in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to the products to
which those support services related.

Research and
Development

Our future performance depends in large part on our
ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms and to
expand our design for manufacturing and IP product offerings. Research and
development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each
product group. In addition, an Advanced Technology Group within Synopsys’
Silicon Engineering Group explores new technologies and maintains strong
research relationships outside Synopsys with both industry and academia.

During fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, research and development expenses, excluding capitalized software
development costs, were $370.6 million, $320.9 million and
$288.8 million, respectively. Synopsys’ capitalized software development
costs were approximately $3.5 million, $3.0 million, and $2.7 million
in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Competition

The EDA industry is highly competitive. We compete
against other EDA vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and
internal design capabilities. In general, we compete principally on technology
leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use),
time-to-results, post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other
vendors’ products, price and payment terms.

Our competitors include
companies that offer a broad range of products and services, such as Cadence
Design Systems, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation, and companies that
offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process,
such as Magma Design Automation, Inc. In recent years, we have
increasingly competed on the basis of payment terms and price. In certain
situations, in order to win business we must offer substantial discounts on our
products due to competitive factors. In other situations, we may lose potential
business to a competitor offering a lower price.

Product Sales and
Licensing Agreements

We typically license our software to customers under
non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and
restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified
geographical areas. The majority of our licenses are network licenses that
allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network,
including, in some cases, regional or global networks. License fees depend on
the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed.


In certain cases, we provide our customers the right
to “re-mix” a portion of the software they initially

licensed for other
specified Synopsys products. For example, a customer may use our front-end
design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such
products for back-end placement software for the remainder of the term in order
to complete the customer’s IC design. This practice helps assure the customer’s
access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. The customer’s
re-mix of product, when so provided under the customer agreement, does not
alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer, which
is governed by our revenue recognition policies. The ability to offer this
right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a
narrower range of products, because customers can obtain more of their design
flow from a single vendor. At the same time, because in such cases the customer
need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of
the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced
revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without re-mix
rights.

We currently offer our software products under various
license types, including renewable TSLs, term licenses and perpetual licenses.
For a full discussion of these licenses, see Part II, Item 7.

Revenue Background

.

With respect to our DesignWare Core intellectual
property products, we typically license those products to our customers under
nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications.
Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in
some cases, royalties.

Finally, our Global
Technical Services team providing design consulting services typically operate
under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific
to each project.

Proprietary Rights

Synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of
copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and
nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. Our
source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished
copyrighted work. However, third parties may develop similar technology
independently. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may
be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. We currently hold
United States and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our
products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future.

Under our customer
agreements and other license agreements, in many cases we offer to indemnify
our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual
property rights. As a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that
our products infringe on these third party rights. For example, we are
currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one
of our products infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics company.
We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue
this defense.

Employees

As of October 31,
2006, Synopsys had 5,130 employees, with 2,842 based in North America and 2,288
based outside of North America.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Overview

and Note 3 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

which are incorporated by reference here.


Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Weakness, budgetary caution or consolidation in the semiconductor and
electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our business.

In recent years, we believe that EDA industry growth
has been adversely affected by many factors, including ongoing efforts by
semiconductor companies to control their spending, uncertainty regarding the
long-term growth rate of the semiconductor industry, excess EDA tool capacity
of some of our customers and increased competition in the EDA industry itself
causing pricing pressure on EDA vendors. If these factors persist or additional
semiconductor industry growth does not occur (or if we do not benefit from any
such increases), our business, operating results and financial condition will
be materially and adversely affected.

We also believe that, over the long term, growth in
EDA spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor R&D
spending and continued growth in the overall semiconductor market. However, we
cannot predict the timing or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues,
R&D spending or spending on EDA products, nor whether we will benefit from
any of these increases should they occur. For example, although the
semiconductor industry grew by 28% in 2004 and 7% in 2005, EDA industry revenue
growth during this period was below these levels.

Competition in the
EDA industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
results.

We compete with other EDA vendors that offer a broad
range of products and services, primarily Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
Mentor Graphics Corporation and with other EDA vendors that offer products
focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process, such as Magma
Design Automation, Inc. We also compete with customers’ internally
developed design tools and capabilities. If we fail to compete effectively, our
business will be materially and adversely affected. We compete principally on
technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of use),
time-to-results, post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other
vendors’ products, price and payment terms.

Additional
competitive challenges include the following:

·

Price continues to be a competitive factor

.   We believe
that some EDA vendors are increasingly offering discounts, which could be
significant. If we are unable to match a competitor’s pricing for a particular
solution, we may lose business, which could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the customer
chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other EDA purchase
with the competitor.

·

Technology in the EDA industry evolves rapidly

.   Accordingly,
we must correctly anticipate and lead critical developments, innovate rapidly
and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or
acquire new products. If we fail to do so, our business will be materially and
adversely affected.

·

To compete effectively, we believe we must offer products that provide
both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level
of individual product performance.

We have invested
significant resources into further development of our Galaxy Design Platform,
integration of our Discovery Verification Platform and enhancement of its
System Verilog and other advanced features and development of our Design for
Manufacturing and IP portfolios. We can provide no assurance that our customers
will find these tool and IP configurations more attractive than our competitors’
offerings or that our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus
individual product performance will be successful.

·

Payment
terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated
by our customers

.   During the second half of fiscal 2003 and
continuing through 2006, payment terms on time-based licenses lengthened
compared to prior periods, negatively affecting our cash flow from


operations. Longer payment terms could
continue in the future, which would negatively affect our future operating cash
flow.

Lack of growth in
new IC design starts, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term
trends may adversely affect the EDA industry, including demand for our products
and services.

The increasing complexity
of SoCs and ICs, and customers’ concerns about managing cost and risk have also
led to the following potentially long-term negative trends:

·

The
number of IC design starts has remained flat during the last three years. New
IC design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for EDA software.

·

A
number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred
and more are likely. Mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of EDA
software and services, and in some cases, increase customers’ bargaining power
in negotiations with their suppliers, including Synopsys.

·

Due
to factors such as increased globalization, cost controls among customers
appear to have become more permanent, adversely impacting our customers’ EDA
spending.

·

Industry
changes, plus the cost and complexity of IC design, may be leading some
companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general, to
focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other
aspects of the design, or using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), an
alternative chip technology.

All of these trends, if sustained, could have a
material adverse effect on the EDA industry, including the demand for our
products and services, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in, or
interpretations of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable
accounting charges or effects, including changes to our prior financial
statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles
are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret
and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles, or
in our interpretations of these principles, can have a significant effect on
our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results.

For example, in September 2006, the SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements

, (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses the process and
diversity in practice of quantifying misstatements and provides interpretive
guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in
quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
assessment. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors
using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover)
approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a
misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered, is material. In the year of adoption, SAB 108 allows a
one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment for errors that were not
previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance in SAB 108.
The guidance in SAB 108 must be applied to annual financial statements for
fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. Synopsys will be required to
adopt the provisions of SAB 108 in fiscal 2007. Synopsys is currently
evaluating the requirements of SAB 108 and the potential impact upon adoption.
Historically, Synopsys has evaluated uncorrected differences utilizing the “rollover”
approach. Although Synopsys believes its prior period assessments of
uncorrected differences utilizing the “rollover” approach and the conclusions
reached regarding its quantitative and qualitative assessments of such
uncorrected differences were appropriate, Synopsys expects that, due to the
analysis required in SAB 108, certain historical uncorrected differences


during fiscal 1999 through
fiscal 2003 related to share-based compensation and fixed assets, will be
corrected upon adoption and reflected in the opening retained earnings balance
for fiscal 2007. There can be no assurance that the SEC will not disagree with
our conclusions.

Synopsys has not yet completed its analysis of SAB
108, however, it estimates that the expected net reduction to its opening
retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007 will be approximately $10 to $12
million. Synopsys is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting SAB 108 and,
as a result, the actual change to opening retained earnings balance for fiscal
2007 could be different than the estimate.

In addition, effective in the first quarter of fiscal
2006, Synopsys was required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

,
(SFAS123(R)), which requires the measurement of all share-based compensation to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based
method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of
operations. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) had, and is expected to
continue to have, a material effect on our reported financial results.

We have received a
Revenue Agent’s Report from the Internal Revenue Service claiming a significant
increase in our U.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome of this examination
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

Our operations are subject to income and transaction
taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions and to review
or audit by IRS and state, local and foreign tax authorities. In connection
with an IRS audit of our United States federal income tax returns for fiscal
years 2000 and 2001, on June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report
in which the IRS proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000
and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. Interest accrues on
the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid, and compounds daily
at the federal underpayment rate, which adjusts quarterly. This proposed
adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between Synopsys
and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. We have filed a protest to the proposed
deficiency with the IRS and the matter is currently under appeal with the IRS.
We expect to begin the appeals process during 2007. However, final resolution
of this matter could take a considerable time, possibly years.

We strongly believe the proposed IRS adjustments and
resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and
that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals. Accordingly, we will
continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. While we believe
the IRS’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law, we believe
it is probable we will be required to make additional payments in order to
resolve this matter. However, based on our analysis to date, we believe we have
adequately provided for this matter. If we determine our provision for this
matter to be inadequate or if we are required to pay a significant amount of
additional U.S. taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for
this matter, our results of operations and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

Unfavorable tax law
changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our
geographical earnings mix could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our
operating results.

Our operations are subject to income and transaction
taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. A change in
the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase
in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense,
could result in a material increase in our tax expense.

In addition, our tax filings are subject to review or
audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing
authorities. We exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for
income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be
transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. We are also undergoing an audit of our United States federal


income tax returns for
fiscal years 2002 through 2004. Although we believe our tax estimates are
reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in the
audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our
historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed
as a result of an audit, there could be a material adverse effect on our income
tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that
determination is made.

Finally, we have large operations both in the United
States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax
rates. In addition, certain foreign operations are subject to temporary
favorable foreign tax rates. Therefore, any changes in our geographical earning
mix in various tax jurisdictions and expiration of foreign tax holidays could
materially increase our effective tax rate.

Our revenue and
earnings fluctuate, which could cause our financial results to not meet
expectations and our stock price to decline.

Many factors affect our revenue and earnings,
including customer demand, license mix, the timing of revenue recognition on
products and services sold and committed expense levels, making it difficult to
predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period. Accordingly,
stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative
of our future performance. If our financial results or targets do not meet
investor and analyst expectations, our stock price could decline.

Some of the
specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular
quarter or over several fiscal periods include, but are not limited to:

·

We
base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and
generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized.
Since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue
shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income.

·

Our
revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain
level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time-based licenses. The
amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the
level of overall license orders, customer demand, preferred customer payment
terms and requested customer ship dates could have a material adverse effect on
our revenue and earnings. For example, if we ship more upfront licenses than
expected during any given fiscal period, our revenue and earnings for that
period could be above our targets even if orders are below target; conversely,
if we ship fewer upfront licenses than expected our revenue and earnings for
that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our
target. Similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of time-based
license orders during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be
negatively affected.

·

We
may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet
our externally-communicated financial targets, any of which could fail to
result in the anticipated cost savings or could adversely affect our business.

·

The
market for EDA products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including
consumer demand for our customers’ products, customer R&D and EDA tool
budgets, pricing, our competitors’ product offerings and customer design
starts. It is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other
factors on our customer’s demand for our products on a medium or long term
basis. As a result, actual future customer purchases could differ materially
from our forecasts which, in turn could cause our actual revenue to be
materially different than our publicly-disclosed targets.

·

We
often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new
products. Although these amendments can provide a longer-term payment stream
from the customers, they can also result in a lower amount of revenue being
recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value
of the extended contract is larger.


·

Certain
of our upfront and time-based license agreements provide customers the right to
re-mix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other
specified Synopsys products. While this practice helps assure the customer’s
access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of
these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the
individual tools separately.

·

In
the past, we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for
a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. The delay of one
or more orders, particularly an upfront order, could have a material adverse
effect on our revenue and/or earnings for that quarter.

·

We
make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition, specifically
determining the existence of proper documentation, establishing that the fee is
fixed or determinable, verifying delivery of our software and assessing the
creditworthiness of our customers. While we believe our judgments in these
areas are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be
challenged in the future. In such an event, we could be required to reduce the
amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods, which would have an
adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods.

·

Our
customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either
alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision.
Accordingly, our customers’ evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our
fiscal quarters. Further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if
customers delay project approvals or starts because of budgetary constraints or
their budget cycles.

The failure to meet
the semiconductor industry’s demands for advancing EDA technology and continued
cost reductions may adversely affect our financial result

s.

SoC and IC functionality continues to increase while
feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk
of IC design and manufacturing. To address greater complexity, semiconductor
designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from EDA suppliers. At
the same time, as a general business trend, we believe some customers and
potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and
at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk. In
order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers’
technology requirements, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and
our own operating costs. Failure to manage these conflicting demands
successfully would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.

Customer payment
defaults or related issues could adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.

Our backlog consists principally of customer payment
obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already
delivered. These customer obligations are typically not cancelable, but will
not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults or
declares bankruptcy and fails to pay amounts owed. In these cases, we will
generally take legal action to recover amounts owed. Moreover, existing
customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to
adverse changes in their own businesses. Though we have not, to date,
experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our
customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

Businesses we have
acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project.

We have acquired a number of companies or their assets
in recent years and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services
offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future.


In addition to
direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including:

·

Potential
negative impact on our earnings per share;

·

Failure
of acquired products to achieve projected sales;

·

Problems
in integrating the acquired products with our products;

·

Difficulties
in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company;

·

Failure
to realize expected synergies or cost savings;

·

Regulatory delays;

·

Drain
on management time for acquisition-related activities;

·

Assumption
of unknown liabilities; and

·

Adverse
effects on customer buying patterns or relationships.

While we review
proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are
favorable to us, we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will
positively affect our future performance. Furthermore, if we later determine we
cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we could be required to
write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the product or
technology; any such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations.

Stagnation of
foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly
global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance.

During each of fiscal 2006 and 2005, we derived 49% of
our revenue from outside the United States; going forward, we expect our
overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial
contributions from outside the United States. Foreign sales are vulnerable to
regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions, including the
effects of international political conflict, hostilities and natural disasters.
Further, any stagnation of foreign economies would adversely affect our
performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the United
States.

Our operating results are also affected by
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations can
be adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other
currencies, including the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar, as a
result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in
foreign currencies into the dollar. Exchange rates are subject to significant
and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact
of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. While we hedge certain foreign currency exposures of our business,
there can be no assurance our hedging activities will completely mitigate our
foreign currency risks.

In addition, we have expanded our non-U.S. operations
significantly in the past several years. While the increased international
presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions locally and
higher international sales, this strategy also requires us to recruit and
retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote
locations performing complex software development projects and ensure
intellectual property protection outside of the United States. The failure to
effectively manage our global operations would have a material adverse effect
on our business and results of operations.

From time to time
we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual
property rights.

Under our customer agreements and other license
agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products
infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights. As a result, we are


from time to time subject
to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. For example,
we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use
of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics
company. In addition, we are currently in patent litigation with Magma Design, Inc.,
one of our competitors. We believe these claims are without merit and will
continue to vigorously pursue them.

These types of claims can, however, result in costly
and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements,
subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, require
us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or
require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could
materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

A failure to
protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our success depends in part upon protecting our
proprietary technology. To protect this technology, we rely on agreements with
customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide. We
can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we
would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not
otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. Moreover,
certain foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection
for intellectual property; our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our
products in those countries is therefore limited. We have a policy of
aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully
appropriate or use our products and technologies. For example, we are pursuing
anti-piracy cases against several companies located in China. However, there
can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. If we do not obtain
or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any
reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain
jurisdictions, our business, financial condition and results of operations
would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, intellectual property
litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such
litigation may reduce our net income.

Our business is
subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that
have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have
an adverse effect on our stock price.

We are subject to rules and regulations
promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations,
including the SEC, Nasdaq and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
Many of these regulations have only recently been enacted, and continue to
evolve, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, our
efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely
to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a
diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities
to compliance activities.

In particular, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment
of our internal control over financial reporting and auditor attestation of
that assessment in our annual reports. This effort has required, and will
continue to require in the future, the commitment of significant financial and
managerial resources. Any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain
our auditors’ attestation could have a material adverse effect on our stock
price.

A failure to timely
recruit and retain key employees or for any reorganizations to be effective
would have a material adverse effect on our business.

To be successful, we must attract and retain key technical,
sales and managerial employees, including those who join Synopsys in connection
with acquisitions. There are a limited number of qualified EDA and IC design
engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. Our employees are
often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. Any failure
to recruit and retain key technical, sales


and managerial employees
would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

From time to time, we may reorganize our operations
for a number of reasons, including to better address customer needs, improve
operational efficiency and reduce expenses. While we undertake any such
reorganization with the expectation that it will result in improve performance,
there can be no assurance that a reorganization will in fact improve our
operations or that it will not lead to the loss of key employees.

We issue stock options and maintain employee stock
purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. There is growing
pressure on public companies from stockholders, who must approve any increases
in our stock option pool, generally to reduce our overhang or amount of
outstanding and unexercised stock options. In addition, our adoption of new
accounting rules that require us to recognize on our income statement
compensation expense from employee stock options and our employee stock
purchase plan may increase pressure to limit future option grants. These
factors may make it more difficult for Synopsys to grant attractive
equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact our ability
to attract and retain key employees.

Product errors or
defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation.

Despite extensive testing
prior to releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or
defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or
when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. Product
errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could
delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products
and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. In
addition, allegations of IC manufacturability issues resulting from use of our
IP products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our
customers’ willingness to license IP products from us. Any such errors or
delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of
unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our
service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources
from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

We own two buildings totaling approximately 230,000
square feet on approximately 43 acres of land in Hillsboro, Oregon, one of
which is currently vacant. The other is used for administrative, marketing, research
and development and support activities. In addition, we lease approximately
80,000 square feet of space in Marlboro, Massachusetts for sales and support,
research and development and customer education activities. This facility is
leased through January 2009.


Synopsys owns a third building in Sunnyvale,
California with approximately 120,000 square feet, which is leased to a third
party through April 2009. Synopsys also owns 34 acres of undeveloped land
in San Jose, California and 13 acres of undeveloped land in Marlboro,
Massachusetts. Synopsys has entered into an agreement to sell the San Jose
property. See Note 15 of

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

Synopsys currently leases
20 other offices throughout the United States, primarily for sales and support
activities.

International
Facilities

Synopsys leases approximately 45,000 square feet in
Dublin, Ireland for its foreign headquarters and for research and development
purposes. This space is leased through April 2026. In addition, Synopsys
leases foreign sales and service offices in Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the People’s
Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and the United
Kingdom. We also lease research and development facilities in Armenia, Canada,
Chile, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the People’s Republic of China,
Russia, Scotland, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

As a result of acquisitions, we have assumed leases in
a number of foreign and domestic locations. Following each acquisition, where
feasible, we consolidate the acquired company’s employees and operations into
our existing local sites. In such cases, we generally seek to sublease the
assumed space or negotiate with the landlord to terminate the underlying lease.

We believe our properties
are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our
facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Synopsys v. Magma
Design Automation, Inc.

In September 2004, Synopsys filed suit against
Magma Design Automation, Inc. (Magma) in U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California alleging infringement by Magma of three patents.
In April 2006, the parties proceeded to trial on the issue of ownership of
these patents (the Ownership Trial). As the ruling from the Ownership Trial
remains pending, in December 2006 Synopsys filed a motion for a
preliminary injunction to require Magma to withdraw its claim of ownership on
the patents considered during the Ownership Trial. In January 2007, the
court granted Synopsys’ motion and directed Magma to transfer record title to
Synopsys. The court has not yet issued a final ruling on the question of ownership.
A second trial (the Infringement Trial) will be required in order to determine
the relief that should issue in connection with any infringement of the
Synopsys patents; however, the court has not yet scheduled the Infringement Trial.

In September 2005, Synopsys
filed two additional actions against Magma. One of the actions, filed in
the Superior Court of California and later removed to the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Magma engaged in actions
that constitute common law and statutory unfair business practices. In that
action Magma filed a motion to dismiss, which remains under submission. In the
remaining action Synopsys asserted three patents against Magma in U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware. In its answer and counterclaims,
Magma asserted patents against Synopsys, and alleged that Synopsys has engaged
in various practices that constitute antitrust violations and has violated
various state laws. Magma seeks declaratory relief that the patents asserted by
Synopsys are invalid or unenforceable. Magma also seeks an injunction
prohibiting Synopsys from infringing the patents it has asserted, and seeks
unspecified damages. Synopsys has filed an answer denying Magma’s allegations
and asserting that the Magma patents at issue are either unenforceable or
invalid. A trial on these issues has been scheduled for June 2007.


Synopsys believes Magma’s
claims in all actions are without merit and is vigorously contesting them.

IRS Revenue Agent’s
Report

On June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent’s
Report (RAR) in which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed to assess a
net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million,
plus interest. Interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally
determined until paid, and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate,
which adjusts quarterly.

This proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer
pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary.
The proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total amount
relating to these transactions asserted under the IRS theories.

On July 13, 2005, we
filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the
matter to be referred to the Appeals Office of the IRS. We expect to begin the
appeals process during 2007. However, final resolution of this matter could
take a considerable time, possibly years. We strongly believe the proposed IRS
adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable
tax laws, and that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals.
Accordingly, we will continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously.
While we believe the IRS’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable
law, we believe it is probable we will be required to make additional payments
in order to resolve this matter. However, based on our analysis to date, we
believe we have adequately provided for this matter. If we determine our
provision for this matter to be inadequate or are required to pay a significant
amount of additional U.S. taxes and applicable interest in excess of our
provision for this matter, our results of operations and financial condition
could be materially and adversely affected.

Other Proceedings

We are also subject to
other routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business. The ultimate
outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a
negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Regardless
of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Synopsys because of the
defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

Overview

The following summary of our financial condition and
results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete
discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item
1A of this Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part 1
of this Report regarding forward-looking statements.

Business
Environment

We generate substantially all of our revenue from
customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries. Our customers
typically fund purchases of our software and services largely out of their
research and development (R&D) budgets and, to a lesser extent, their
manufacturing and capital budgets. As a result, our customers’ business outlook
and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs heavily
influence our business.

Since the 2000 through 2002 semiconductor downturn and
subsequent recovery, our customers have focused significantly on expense
reductions, including in their R&D budgets. This expense outlook has
affected us in a number of ways. First, some customers have reduced their EDA
expenditures by decreasing their level of EDA tool purchases, using older
generations of EDA products or by not renewing maintenance services. Second,
customers bargain more intensely on pricing and payment terms, which has
affected revenues industry-wide. For example, customers’ desire to conserve
cash by paying for licenses over time resulted in a shift of our license mix to
an almost completely ratable model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, in
which substantially more revenue is recognized over time rather than at the
time of shipment. This shift adversely affected our total revenue in fiscal
2004, 2005 and 2006. Third, some customers are consolidating their EDA
purchases with fewer suppliers in order to lower their overall cost of
ownership while at the same time meeting new technology challenges. This has
increased competition among EDA vendors.

Recognizing that our
customers will continue to spend cautiously and will work to aggressively
contain costs, we are intensely focused on improving our customers’ overall
economics of design by providing more fully integrated design solutions and
offering customers the opportunity to consolidate their EDA spending with us.
Over the long term, we believe EDA industry spending growth will continue to
depend on growth in semiconductor R&D spending and on continued growth in
the overall semiconductor market. The Semiconductor Industry Association has
forecasted modest growth in semiconductor revenues during 2007 and we believe
semiconductor R&D spending will grow as well. However, we cannot currently
predict whether this outlook will contribute to higher EDA industry spending.

Fiscal 2006 Product
Developments

During fiscal 2006,
we announced or introduced a number of new products and product developments,
including:

·

Availability
of our PrimeYield tool suite that helps integrate design with manufacturing by
predicting design-induced mechanisms that threaten manufacturing tolerances and
by providing automated correction guidance to upstream implementation tools.

·

Release
of enhancements to our TetraMAX automatic test pattern generation product that
result in a typical speedup of three times or more in runtime performance
compared with the previous version.

·

Availability
of a new family of process-aware design-for-manufacturing products that analyze
variability effects at the custom/analog design stage for 45-nanometer
and smaller designs,


·

Availability
of DesignWare

USB 2.0
nanoPHY intellectual property (IP) for mobile, high volume consumer devices
tailored specifically for low power consumption, small chip area and high
manufacturing yield.

·

Our
DesignWare

verification
IP became the first to support the System Verilog language and methodology
decreasing the cost of test bench development and helping designers reduce risk
and meet project schedules.

·

Availability of simulation software from our acquisition of

SIGMA-C
Software AG that allows semiconductor manufacturers and their suppliers to
develop and optimize process sequences for optical lithography, e-beam
lithography and next-generation lithography technologies.

Fiscal 2006
Financial Performance Summary

·

Revenue
was $1,095.6 million, up 10% from $991.9 million in fiscal 2006, primarily due
to an increase in time-based license revenue from orders booked in prior
periods which more than offset a decrease in service revenue recognized during
fiscal 2006.

·

Time-based
license revenue increased 18% from $743.7 million in fiscal 2005 to $874.9
million in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting the continuation of our highly
ratable license model for an additional four quarters combined with increased
business levels in earlier quarters.

·

Upfront
license revenue increased 4% from $60.5 million in fiscal 2005 to $63.1 million
in fiscal 2006, within our target range, due to normal fluctuations in customer
demand for upfront licenses.

·

We
derived approximately 7% of our software license revenue from upfront licenses
and 93% from time-based licenses in fiscal 2006, versus approximately 8% and
92%, respectively, in fiscal 2005, within our target range for ratable license
revenue.

·

Maintenance
revenue declined by 24% from $136.3 million in fiscal 2005 to $103.1 million in
fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of non-renewal of maintenance by some of our
existing perpetual license customers and the continuing shift to a larger
percentage of time-based licenses in which maintenance is bundled and not
charged separately. Professional service and other revenue, at $54.5 million,
increased 6% from $51.4 million in fiscal 2005 due to the timing of customer
acceptance of services performed under ongoing contracts.

·

Net
income was $24.7 million compared to a net loss of $(17.1) million in fiscal
2005, primarily due to increased revenue and reduced cost of goods sold arising
from reduced amortization expense. This increase was partially offset by
increased research and development expenses driven by acquisitions and
increased investment in our core products, commencement of share-based
compensation expense under SFAS 123(R) in fiscal 2006, and the absence of
a large litigation settlement received in fiscal 2005.

·

We
repurchased approximately 10.0 million shares of our common stock at an average
price of $19.94 per share for a total of approximately $200.0 million.

·

Operating cash flow
decreased 24% from $269.2 million in fiscal 2005 to $205.9 million in fiscal
2006 primarily as a result of increased payments to vendors, increased
commission and bonus payments and the timing of billings on time-based license
agreements. In addition, in fiscal 2005, operating income included a $33
million litigation settlement gain relating to the acquisition of Nassda
Corporation.


Fiscal 2006
Acquisitions

During fiscal 2006, we
acquired: (1) HPL Technologies, Inc. a provider of yield management
and test chip products that will allow designers to better address defects at
the IC design phase, (2) Virtio Corporation, a creator of virtual

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

We base the discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial
statements, which we prepare in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. In preparing these financial statements, we must make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on
historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

The accounting
policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and
therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:

·

Revenue
recognition;

·

Valuation
of intangible assets;

·

Income
taxes; and

·

Valuation of share-based
compensation

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from software licenses and
maintenance and service revenue. Software license revenue consists of fees
associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue
consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and
professional service fees.

We have designed and implemented revenue recognition
policies in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, “Software
Revenue Recognition,” as amended.

With respect to
software licenses, we utilize three license types:

·

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

,
are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer
limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed
software for, unspecified future technology. We bundle and do not charge
separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the
license.

·

Term Licenses,

are also for a finite term,
but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed
software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance
separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the
term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the
net license fee.

·

Perpetual Licenses,

continue as long as
the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual
licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange


licensed software for,
unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for
the first year and may renew annually.

For the three
software license types, we recognize revenue as follows:

·

TSLs.

We typically recognize revenue
from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license
period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later.
Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based revenue” in the
statement of operations.

·

Term Licenses.

We recognize the term
license fee in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the
customer to pay at least 75% of the term license fee within one year from
shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue
attributable to these term licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in
the statement of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the
term license fee is due within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as
customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based
revenue” in the statement of operations.

·

Perpetual Licenses.

We recognize the
perpetual license fee in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms
require the customer to pay at least 75% of the perpetual license fee within
one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront
revenue” in the statement of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less
than 75% of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment, we
recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Revenue
attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “time-based revenue” in
the statement of operations.

In addition, we recognize revenue from maintenance
fees associated with term and perpetual licenses ratably over the maintenance
period and recognize revenue from professional service and training fees as
such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable
to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “service
revenue” in the statement of operations.

Our determination of fair value of each element in
multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence
(VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged
when such element is sold separately.

We have analyzed all of the elements included in our
multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have
sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our
perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly,
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license
revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual
method, we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance
term, and we recognize revenue from professional services as the related
services are performed and accepted. We recognize revenue from TSLs ratably
over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria
are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to allocate the TSL fee between
license and maintenance services.

We make significant
judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each
transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services
has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or
determinable, and (4) collectibility of the full license or service fee is
probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize
revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue
recognition criteria as follows.

·

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.

Prior
to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a
written contract, signed by both the customer and us or a purchase


order from those customers
that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or
purchase agreement.

·

Delivery Has Occurred.

We deliver
software to our customers physically or electronically. For physical
deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. For
electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide the customer access
codes, or “license keys,” that allow the customer to take immediate possession
of the software by downloading it to the customer’s hardware. We generally ship
our software products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer
orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments
and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates
requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill software license
orders at the end of a quarter.

·

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable.

Our
determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends
principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms
require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year. If the
arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable,
and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery
(assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement
does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or
determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due
and payable. In the case of a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee
is fixed or determinable, due to the fact that VSOE for maintenance services
does not exist for a TSL and due to revenue recognition criteria relating to
arrangements that include rights to exchange products or receive unspecified
future technology.

·

Collectibility is Probable.

We judge
collectibility of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant
to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a
history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing
customer substantially expands its commitments to us, we evaluate the customer’s
financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based
on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a
successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time
that collectibility is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon
our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize
revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.

Valuation
of Intangible Assets.

We
evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights
intangibles, customer-installed base/relationships, trademarks and trade
names, covenants not to compete, customer backlog, capitalized software and
other intangibles. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include
significant under-performance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our
use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or
significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates
that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment
of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining
useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not
recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the
technology over the remaining amortization period, we reduce the net carrying
value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the
remaining amortization period. Any such impairment charge could be significant
and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We
did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal
2006. As of October 31, 2006, the carrying amount of our intangible
assets, net was $106.1 million.


Income
Taxes.

We calculate our current and deferred
tax provisions in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109). Our estimates and assumptions used in
such provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income
tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified and
resolved.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect
the differences to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In
evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available
positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the
existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast
of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as
feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require
significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are
consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying
businesses. We believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance
sheet will ultimately be realized. If we determine that it is more likely than
not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax
assets, we record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance
as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.

We have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings
of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings
indefinitely outside the United States. If the cumulative foreign earnings
exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future, we
would provide taxes on such excess amount. As of October 31, 2006, there
was approximately $31.0 million in earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have
not been provided.

In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex
tax laws. We are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities. We
believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential
additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is
unnecessary, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in
the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If
an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would
record an additional charge to earnings. See

of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for a discussion
of a Revenue Agent’s Report from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) we received
in June 2005 asserting a very large net increase to our U.S. tax arising
from the audit of fiscal years 2000 and 2001.

Valuation of Share-Based Compensation.

Effective November 1, 2005, we
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)) using
the modified prospective method. SFAS 123(R) establishes standards for
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments, such as stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock or
restricted stock units, for goods or services, such as the services of the
entity’s employees. SFAS 123(R) also addresses transactions in which an entity
incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair
value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance
of those equity instruments. SFAS 123(R) eliminates the ability to account
for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

, and generally requires instead that
these transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based method.
Accordingly, we measure share-based compensation cost at the grant date, based
on the fair value of the award, and recognize the expense over the employee’s
requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method. The
measurement of share-based compensation cost is based on several criteria
including, but not limited to, the valuation model used and associated input
factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free
interest rate and award cancellation rate. These input factors are subjective
and are determined using management’s


judgment. If a
difference arises between the assumptions used in determining share-based
compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time, we may
change the input factors used in determining future share-based compensation
costs. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in
the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter.

Operations

Revenue Background

We generate our revenue from the sale of software
licenses, maintenance and professional services. Under current accounting rules and
policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses and
services at varying times. In general, we recognize revenue on a time-based
software license order quarterly over the license term and on an upfront term
or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is
shipped. Substantially all of our current time-based licenses are TSLs with an
average license term of approximately three years. Maintenance orders generally
generate revenue ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year).
Professional service orders generally generate revenue upon completion and
customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones. A more complete
description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

.

Our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum
of our time-based license, upfront license, maintenance and professional
service revenue for the period. We derive time-based license revenue in any
quarter almost entirely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior
quarters. We derive upfront license revenue directly from upfront term and perpetual
license orders booked and shipped during the quarter. We derive maintenance
revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior
quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a
term of one year. We also derive professional service revenue almost entirely
from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from
professional services when those services are delivered and accepted, not when
they are booked.

Our license revenue is
very sensitive to the mix of time-based and upfront licenses delivered during
the quarter. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but
contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a
three-year TSL shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no
revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters.
Conversely, upfront licenses generate current quarter revenue but no future
revenue (e.g., a $120,000 order for an upfront license generates $120,000 in
revenue in the quarter the product is shipped, but no future revenue). TSLs
also result in a shift of maintenance revenue to time-based license revenue
since maintenance is included in revenue reported for TSLs, while maintenance
on upfront orders is charged and reported separately.

The increase in total
revenue for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to an
increase in time-based license revenue from orders booked in prior periods
which more than offset a decrease in service revenue during the fiscal 2006.
The decrease in total revenue for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due
primarily to our license model shift begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004, which significantly reduced both upfront license fees and maintenance
revenue in fiscal 2005.

The increase in time-based

The slight increase in
upfront license revenue for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily
due to normal fluctuations in customer demand for upfront licenses following
the adoption of our highly ratable license model. The significant decrease in
upfront license revenue, in both percentage and absolute dollar terms, for
fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the fact that we
shipped a substantially higher-than-average percentage of orders as upfront
licenses in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2004 and subsequently
shifted to a higher ratable license mix in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

Our maintenance revenue has declined due to (1) the
decrease in our upfront licenses (which reduces new maintenance orders since
maintenance is purchased separately with upfront licenses), (2) generally
lower maintenance rates on large perpetual transactions and (3) non-renewal
of maintenance by certain customers on perpetual or other upfront licenses.
With our license model shift, we expect progressively more of our maintenance
revenue will be included in time-based license revenue and therefore for our
separately recognized maintenance revenue to continue to decline. In addition,
some customers may continue to choose in the future not to renew maintenance on
upfront licenses for economic or other factors, which would adversely affect
future maintenance revenue.


Professional service and
other revenue increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and in fiscal
2005 compared to fiscal 2004 due to timing of performance milestones under
ongoing contracts.

Events Affecting
Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses

Certain Option Expenses.

As
previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, subsequent to the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, we discovered an error in our option grant process related to the
documentation of grant dates. This error was solely with respect to grants to
non-executive officer employees. We recorded $3.6 million in fiscal 2005
relating to this error as follows: $0.5 million in cost of goods sold, $1.3
million in research and development expense, $0.9 million in sales and
marketing expense and $0.9 million in general and administrative expense.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we booked $1.6 million in relation to
this error as follows: $0.2 million in cost of goods sold, $0.8 million in
research and development expense, $0.4 million in sales and marketing expense
and $0.2 million in general and administrative expense. Finally, we expect to recognize
an aggregate of approximately $1.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million of
expense relating to this error in fiscal 2007, 2008 and 2009. The error was not
material to any prior fiscal year’s results of operations.

Temporary
Shutdown of Operations

.   As
a cost saving measure, we temporarily shut down operations in North America for
three days during the first quarters of fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and for four days during the third quarter of fiscal 2004
resulting in savings of approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2006,
$4.4 million in fiscal 2005, and $7.6 million in fiscal 2004. The
savings in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 relate primarily to salaries and
benefits and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows:

We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost
of license revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue and amortization of
intangible assets. Expenses directly associated with providing consulting and
training have been segregated from costs of revenue associated with internal
functions which provide license delivery and post-customer contract support
services. These group costs are then allocated by management between cost of
license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license
and service revenue reported during the quarter.

Cost of license revenue.

Cost of license
revenue includes costs associated with the sale and licensing of our software
products, both time-based and upfront. Cost of license revenue includes the
allocated cost of employee salary and benefits for providing software delivery,
including software production costs, product packaging, amortization of
capitalized software development costs related to Synopsys products, documentation
and royalties payable to third party vendors.

Cost of maintenance and service revenue.

Cost of maintenance
and service revenue includes employee salary and benefits for consulting
professionals and associated costs to maintain the related infrastructure
necessary to operate our services and training organization. Further, cost of
maintenance and service revenue includes allocated costs of employee salary and
benefits for providing customer services, such as hotline and on-site support,
production services and documentation of maintenance updates.

Amortization of intangible assets.

See

Amortization of Intangible Assets

below
for information regarding the amount of amortization charged to cost of revenue
for the relevant periods.

The decrease in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2006
compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decrease of $53.0 million in
amortization of intangible assets resulting from completion of  amortization of certain intangible assets
primarily acquired in the acquisition of Avant! Corporation in June 2002.
This decrease was partially offset by increases of (1) recognition of $9.2
million in share-based compensation expense due to adoption of SFAS 123(R); (2) $6.1
million in compensation and employee benefits due to our increased investment
in personnel through acquisitions including $1.0 million in compensation due to
former ISE  Integrated Systems
Engineering AG employees based on achievement of certain sales and employee
retention milestones; and (3) $5.8 million in corporate allocated expenses
including human resources, information technology and facilities costs, allocated
to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal 2005 as a result of
increased allocable expenses.

The decrease in total cost
of revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to: (1) net
reduction of $20.7 million in amortization expense in core/developed technology
caused by completion of amortization from fiscal 2002 acquisitions, partially
offset by amortization charges from the ISE and Nassda acquisitions, and (2) the
reduction in royalty expense of $1.3 million primarily resulting from reversal
of a $1.0 million accrual recorded in fiscal 2004 for a potential payment
ultimately not required to be paid. This decrease was partially offset by an
increase of: (1) $14.0 million in compensation and employee benefits as a
result of (a) our increased investment in professional services personnel
and


(b) higher
variable compensation associated with our higher-than-expected business
performance; (2) $1.2 million in compensation due to former ISE employees
based on achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones; and (3) $3.2
million in corporate allocated expenses including human resources, information
technology and facilities costs, allocated to this line item compared to the
same period in fiscal 2004 as a result of increased allocable expenses.

The increase in research and development expense in
fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to: (1) recognition
of $28.0 million in share-based compensation expense due to adoption of SFAS
123(R); (2) an increase of $12.6 million in research and development
personnel-related costs as a result of acquisitions including $4.5 million in
compensation due to former ISE employees now employed by Synopsys based upon
achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones; and (3) an
increase of $8.9 million in corporate allocated expenses, including human
resources, information technology and facilities costs, allocated to this line
item compared to the same period in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased
corporate-wide allocable expenses.

The increase in research
and development expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily
due to: (1) an increase of $30.9 million in research and development
personnel and related costs primarily as a result of the ISE and Nassda
Corporation acquisitions, including $5.3 million in compensation due to former
ISE employees now employed by Synopsys based upon achievement of certain sales
and employee retention milestones; and (2) an increase of $4.7 million in
human resources, information technology and facilities costs allocated to this
line item compared to fiscal 2004. This increase was partially offset by a
decrease of $2.7 million in contractor costs as former contractors in
lower-cost regions were converted to employees.

The decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal
2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to: (1) an $10.6 million
reduction in variable compensation driven by shipments relative to our
operating plan; (2) a $2.4 million reduction in sales and marketing
personnel-related costs due to reductions in headcount; and (3) the
absence in fiscal 2006 of $6.4 million in costs associated with a reduction in
force made during fiscal 2005. This decrease was partially offset by (1) recognition
of $16.2 million in share-based compensation expense due to adoption of SFAS
123(R); and (2) an increase of $1.2 million in corporate allocated
expenses, including human resources, information technology and facilities
costs, allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal 2005
as a result of increased allocable expenses.


The increase in sales and
marketing expense in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to: (1) an
increase of $27.8 million in variable compensation driven by shipments, higher
commission rates applied to shipments beginning in fiscal 2005 and increased
business performance-related compensation; (2) an increase of $4.6 million
in sales and marketing personnel and related costs due to increased headcount
and acquisitions during the fiscal year; and (3) an increase of $4.6
million in severance-related costs associated with a workforce reduction
executed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005. These increases
were partially offset by decreases of: (1) $4.2 million as a result of a
reduction in expenses for sales conferences and related meetings; (2) $1.6
million in human resources, information technology and facilities corporate
allocated costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2004 as a result
of decreased headcount; (3) $1.2 million related to reduced depreciation to
this line item; and (4) $1.0 million related to reduced travel expenses.

The increase in general and administrative expense in
fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to: (1) recognition
of $9.5 million in share-based compensation expense due to adoption of SFAS
123(R); (2) an increase of $3.1 million in facilities costs and property
taxes; (3) an increase of $9.7 million in professional services
expenses related to litigation matters, audit activities, Sarbanes Oxley Act
compliance and tax services; (4) an increase of $3.2 million as a result
of reduction in bad debt reserve taken in fiscal 2005 in excess of those taken
in fiscal 2006; and (5) an increase of $2.2 million in telecommunication
and networking expenses. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of (1) $3.2 million
decrease in compensation expense primarily related to reduction in headcount; (2) $2.1
million decrease in travel, employee training and functions, and other related
costs; and (3) $15.4 million decrease in corporate allocated expenses,
including human resources, information technology and facilities costs.

Fiscal 2004 general and
administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005 primarily due to: (1) the
$10 million merger termination fee paid to Monolithic System Technology, Inc.
(MoSys) in April 2004 in connection with termination of an acquisition
agreement; (2) $5.4 million in professional service fees primarily related
to litigation associated with the MoSys termination incurred in 2004; (3) $1.7
million in professional services fees incurred in connection with the proposed
acquisition of MoSys expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004; (4) a
decrease of $3.2 million in bad debt reserve in fiscal 2005 due to lower than
anticipated billings and successful collection efforts; (5) a decrease of
$1.9 million in facilities costs in fiscal 2005 due to closure of certain
facilities; and (6) a decrease of $6.3 million in corporate allocated
expenses, including human resources, information technology and facilities
costs. Lower fiscal 2005 expenses were partially offset by an increase of (1) $3.5 million
in employee compensation in fiscal 2005 due to increased headcount; (2) $2.2
million in depreciation due to additional equipment and assets acquired and
used this functional area; and (3) $2.7 million in consulting costs
primarily related to market and internal business process analyses. See “

Functional Allocation of Operating Expenses,

” above.

In-Process Research
and Development

In-process research and development (IPRD) expense is
comprised of in-process technologies of (1) $0.8 million associated with
the acquisition of HPL in fiscal 2006; (2) $5.7 million associated with
the acquisition of ISE in fiscal 2005; and (3) $1.6 million associated
with an immaterial acquisition in fiscal 2004. At the date of each
acquisition, the projects associated with the IPRD efforts had not yet


reached technological
feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative
future uses. Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the
respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies.

Valuation of IPRD.

The value assigned to acquired in-process
technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for
which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition
date. The value of in-process technology is then divided into two
classifications: (1) developed technology (completed) and (2) in-process
technology (to-be-completed), giving explicit consideration to the value
created by the research and development efforts of the acquired business prior
to the date of acquisition and expected to be created by Synopsys after the
acquisition. These value creation efforts were estimated by considering the
following major factors: (1) time-based data, (2) cost-based data and
(3) complexity-based data.

The value of the in-process technology was determined
using a discounted cash flow model that focuses on the income producing
capabilities of the in-process technologies. Under this approach, the value is
determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the
identified products. Revenue estimates were based on (1) individual
product revenues, (2) anticipated growth rates, (3) anticipated
product development and introduction schedules, (4) product sales cycles,
and (5) the estimated life of a product’s underlying technology. From the
revenue estimates, operating expense estimates, including costs of sales,
general and administrative, sales and marketing, income taxes and a use charge
for contributory assets, were deducted to arrive at operating income. We
estimated revenue growth rates for each product and gave consideration to
relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected industry trends, the
anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our
competitors, individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each
product’s underlying technology. Operating expense estimates reflect Synopsys’
historical expense ratios. The resulting operating income stream was discounted
to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition.

The rate used to discount the net cash flows from
purchased in-process technology is our weighted-average cost of capital,
taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various
areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future
revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired in-process technology,
the useful life of such technology, the profitability of such technology, if
any, and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which are unknown at
this time.

HPL.

On December 7,
2005, we acquired HPL Technologies, Inc. (HPL), a yield management and
test chip technology company. The IPRD expense related to the HPL acquisition
was $0.8 million. HPL had one IPRD project - YieldDirector. This project was
completed during fiscal 2006 and the resulting products have begun to generate
revenue. The expenditures to complete HPL’s acquired in-process technologies
approximated the original estimates.

ISE.

On
November 2, 2004, we acquired ISE, a leading provider of TCAD (Technology
Computer-Aided Design) software and related services. The IPRD expense related
to the ISE acquisition was $5.7 million. ISE had one IPRD project—FLOOPS,
a next generation process simulator.


Amortization
of Intangible Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets
includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain
executory contracts and the amortization of core/developed technology,
trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete and
other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in prior years. Amortization
expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:

Amortization of capitalized software development costs

The decrease in amortization of intangible assets in
fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to completion of
amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of
Avant!.

The decrease in amortization of intangible assets in
fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is driven by completion of the amortization
of the intangible assets related to core/developed technology from fiscal 2002
acquisitions, partially offset by amortization charges from the ISE and Nassda
acquisitions.

For the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2006, these amounts are comprised primarily of $5.5
million in investment earnings related to the change in the fair value of the deferred
compensation plan assets, partially offset by $3.0 million in premiums paid on
foreign exchange forward contracts. For the fiscal year ended October 31,
2005, the amount included a $33 million litigation settlement gain relating to


the acquisition of Nassda
Corporation, and $5.8 million in the fair value increase of the non-qualified
deferred compensation plan obligation.

In the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, we re-evaluated our interpretation of certain provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivatives and Hedging

(SFAS 133), resulting in the discovery
of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign
currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error was not material in any
prior period and did not impact the economics of the our hedging program. To
correct the error, we reclassified the remaining $3.0 million related to the
disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005. See Notes 2 and 10 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

Income Taxes

The relative proportions of our domestic and foreign
revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate. We are also subject
to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate. As of October 31,
2006, current deferred tax assets, net of current deferred tax liabilities,
totaled $112.3 million. Non-current deferred tax assets, net of non-current
deferred tax liabilities, totaled $203.1 million. We believe it is more likely
than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable
income to utilize our net deferred tax assets. We consider future taxable
income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing
the need for any valuation allowance, and if we determine we would not be able
to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would
record a charge to income and an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the
period we make that determination.

We have not provided taxes for
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest
such earnings indefinitely outside the United States. If the cumulative foreign
earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the
future, we would provide taxes on such excess amount. As of October 31,
2006, there was approximately $31.0 million earnings upon which income taxes
have not been provided.

Effective Tax Rate

The
following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax
rates for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

For fiscal year 2006, the effective tax rate includes
state tax expense of $5.5 million for prior year state taxes, primarily as a
result of state tax audits settled and a settlement offer made in fiscal 2006
and associated interest and penalties, as well as a reduction in an estimated
fiscal 2005 state research and development credit benefit. In addition as
required by SFAS 123(R), no tax benefit was recorded in the fiscal year ended October 31,
2006 for expenses relating to qualified stock options and share-based
compensation costs which are borne by our foreign subsidiaries.


For fiscal year 2005, the effective tax rate includes
the impact of $11.6 million tax expense associated with repatriation of
approximately $185.0 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. For fiscal year 2004, the effective tax
rate reflects the tax benefit derived from higher earnings in low-tax
jurisdictions.

During fiscal year 2006, primarily due to a tax
accounting method change, there was a decrease of $83.2 million in the current
deferred tax assets, and a corresponding increase in non-current deferred tax
assets. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we changed our tax accounting
method on our tax return for fiscal year 2005 with respect to the current
portion of deferred revenue to follow the recognition of revenue under U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. This accounting method change, as well as other
adjustments made to our taxable income upon the filing of the fiscal year 2005
tax return, resulted in an increase in our operating loss (NOL) carryforwards.

In May 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and
Reconciliation Act of 2005 was enacted, which provides a three-year exception
to current U.S. taxation of certain foreign intercompany income. This provision
will first apply to Synopsys in fiscal year 2007. Management estimates that had
such provisions been applied for fiscal 2006, our income tax expense would have
been reduced by approximately $3 million.

In December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care
Act of 2006 was enacted, which retroactively extended the research and
development credit from January 1, 2006. As a result, we will record an
expected increase in our fiscal 2006 research and development credit of between
$1.5 million and $1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

Revision of Prior Year
Financial Statements.

As
part of our remediation of the material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting identified in fiscal 2005 relating to accounting for income
taxes we implemented additional internal control and review procedures. Through
such procedures, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we identified four
errors totaling $8.2 million which affected our income tax provision in fiscal
years 2001 through 2005. We concluded that these errors were not material to
any prior year financial statements. Although the errors are not material to
prior periods, we elected to revise prior year financial statements to correct
such errors. The fiscal periods in which the errors originated, and the
resulting change in provision (benefit) for income taxes for each year, are
reflected in the following table:

Year Ended October 31 (in thousands)






$205

$

1,833

$

The errors were as follows: (1) Synopsys
inadvertently provided a $1.4 million tax benefit for the write-off of goodwill
relating to an acquisition in fiscal 2002; (2) Synopsys did not accrue
interest and penalties for certain foreign tax contingency items in the amount
of $3.2 million; (3) Synopsys made certain computational errors relating
to foreign dividends of $2.3 million; and (4) Synopsys did not record a
valuation allowance relating to certain state tax credits of $1.3 million. As
result of this revision, non-current deferred tax assets decreased by
$8.1 million and current taxes payable increased by $0.2 million. Retained
earnings decreased by $8.2 million and additional paid in capital decreased by
$0.1 million. See Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

for a further discussion of our remediation of the material weakness.

Tax
Effects of Stock Awards.

In November 2005,
FASB issued a Staff Position (FSP) on FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards.

Effective upon issuance, this FSP
describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of
share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition
method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional
paid-in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock
based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and
the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share-based
compensation


awards that are
outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). We elected to use the alternative
transition method in fiscal 2006 and have not recognized any excess tax
benefits during fiscal 2006.

IRS
Revenue Agent’s Report.

On June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent’s
Report (RAR) in which the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) proposed to assess a
net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8
million, plus interest. Interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency
finally determined until paid, and compounds daily at the federal underpayment
rate, which adjusts quarterly. This proposed adjustment primarily relates to
transfer pricing transactions between the Company and a wholly-owned foreign
subsidiary. The proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total
amount relating to these transactions asserted under the IRS theories.

On July 13, 2005, we filed a protest to the
proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the matter to be referred to the
Appeals Office of the IRS. We expect to begin the appeals process during fiscal
2007. However, final resolution of this matter could take a considerable time,
possibly years. We strongly believe the proposed IRS adjustments and resulting
proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that
Synopsys thus has meritorious defenses to these proposals. Accordingly, we will
continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. While we believe
the IRS’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law, we believe
it is probable we will be required to make additional payments in order to
resolve this matter. However, based on our analysis to date, we believe we have
adequately provided for this matter. If we determine our provision for this
matter to be inadequate or we are required to pay a significant amount of
additional U.S. taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for
this matter, our results of operations and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

In the third quarter of 2006, the IRS started an
examination of our federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2004. As
of the end of fiscal 2006, no adjustments had been proposed as a result of this
audit.

Repatriation of foreign
earnings.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act) provides for a
special one-time elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of
certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer equal to 85% of the eligible
distribution. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Synopsys repatriated $360.0
million, of which approximately $185.0 million qualified for the special one-time
elective dividends received deduction and the balance of which constituted
earnings that did not qualify under the Jobs Creation Act, previously taxed
income and return of capital. Synopsys recorded tax expense of $11.6 million
related to the repatriation of $360 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005,
our chief executive officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan (DRIP) to
invest up to $185.0 million in foreign earnings in qualified investments
pursuant to the Jobs Creation Act. As required by the Jobs Creation Act, the
reinvestment plan was ratified by the Board of Directors in the first quarter
of fiscal 2006. Synopsys satisfied the DRIP reinvestment requirements during
fiscal 2005.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Our sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may
be drawn down under our credit facility.

The following sections
discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and other commitments on
our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2006.

Cash
flows from operating activities.

Cash
provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our
license agreements. For an upfront license, we require that 75% of the license
fee be paid within the first year. Conversely, payment terms for time-based
licenses are generally extended; typically the license fee is paid quarterly in
even increments over the term of the license. Accordingly, we generally receive
cash from upfront licenses much sooner than for time-based licenses.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased
primarily as a result of increased payments to vendors, increased commission
and bonus payments and the timing of billing on time-based license agreements.
In addition, in fiscal 2005, net income included a $33 million litigation
settlement gain relating to the acquisition of Nassda Corporation.

Cash
flows from investing activities.

The
reduction in the cash used for investing activities primarily relate to
acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable
securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support
our growth.

Cash
flows from financing activities.

The
increased use of cash for financing activities primarily relate to a higher
amount of stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, partially offset
by increased proceeds from issuance of stock pursuant to exercises of stock
options.

We hold our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments in the United States and in foreign accounts, primarily in Ireland,
Bermuda, and Japan. As of October 31, 2006, we held an aggregate of $434.1
million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United
States and an aggregate of $138.6 million in foreign accounts. Funds in foreign
accounts are generated from revenue outside North America. At present, such
foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
countries. See “Income Taxes” above.

We expect that cash
provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of
a number of factors, including fluctuations in the timing of our billings and
collections, our operating results, the timing and amount of tax and other
liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions.

The increase in accounts
receivable was primarily due to the increased billings during the fiscal year
ended October 31, 2006. Days sales outstanding (DSO) was 39 days at October 31,
2006 and 36 days at October 31, 2005. Our accounts receivable and DSO are
primarily driven by our billing and collections activities.

Net Working Capital

Working capital is
comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our balance
sheet. As of October 31, 2006, our working capital was $23.4 million,
compared to $130.6 million as of October 31, 2005. The decrease in net
working capital of $107.2 million was primarily due to (1) a decrease of
$73.7 million in cash and cash equivalents; (2) a decrease of current
deferred tax assets of $83.2 million, primarily due to a tax accounting method
change; (3) a decrease in income taxes receivable of $5.8 million; (4) an
increase in income taxes payable of $21.5 million; (5) an increase in
deferred revenue of $29.9 million; and (6) a net increase of $2.8 million
in accounts payable and other liabilities which included a reclassification of
debt of $7.5 million from long term to short term debt. This decrease was
partially offset by (1) an increase in short-term investments of $59.9
million; (2) an increase in prepaid and other assets of $27.4 million,
which includes land of $23.4 million reclassified from property plant and
equipment to asset held for sale within prepaid expense and other assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet; and (3) an increase in accounts receivable of
$22.4 million.

Other Commitments—Revolving
Credit Facility

On October 20, 2006, we entered into a five-year,
$300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans
to Synopsys and certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The facility replaces our
previous $250.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, which was terminated
effective October 20, 2006. The amount of the facility may be increased by
up to an additional $150.0 million through the fourth year of the facility. The
facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum
leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial
covenants. The facility terminates on October 20, 2011. Borrowings under
the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent’s prime
rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, we have the option to pay
interest based on the outstanding amount at Eurodollar rates plus a spread
between 0.50% and 0.70% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant.
In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between
0.125% and 0.175% per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial
covenant. As of October 31, 2006 we had no outstanding borrowings under
this credit facility and were in compliance with all the covenants.

We believe that our
current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from
operations, and available credit under our credit facility will satisfy our
business requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Purchase obligations
represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations
in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or
services as of October 31, 2006. Although open purchase orders are
considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the
option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business
needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

(4)

Includes (a) approximately
$6.1 million in promissory notes payable in September 2007 issued in
connection with an acquisition in September 2002 and (b) a bond
payable to the city of San Jose for participating in a development project for
land owned by us. Additional information is provided in Note 5 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

. Certain long-term
liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenue, are not
presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the
future.

In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
October 31, 2006, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $14.6
million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional $11.3 million in
cash during the two years subsequent to fiscal 2007 if certain performance and
milestone goals are achieved. Because these commitments are contingent on
certain performance and milestone goals, these amounts are not reflected in the
table above.

The expected timing of
payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current
information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different
depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon
amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone-based
obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of
the contingent events and can vary significantly.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
Rate Risk.

Our
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our
short-term investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment
activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing
yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we
maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of
tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as
specified in our investment policy. None of our investments are held for
trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one issue, issuer and type of instrument.

The
following table presents the carrying value and related weighted-average
total return for our investment portfolio as of October 31, 2006:

As of October 31, 2006, the stated maturities of
our current short-term investments are $51.6 million within one year,
$91.2 million within one to five years, $10.5 million within five to
ten years and $88.7 million after ten years. However, we consider these
investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance with our
investment policy, the weighted-average expected duration of our total invested
funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term
obligations and other uses including acquisitions. These investments are
recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or
losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of tax.

Foreign
Currency Risk.

The functional currency of each
of Synopsys’ active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local
currency, except for our principal Irish and Swiss subsidiaries whose
functional currencies are the U.S. dollar. We engage in a program to
minimize the effect of changes in the exchange rate between a given functional
currency (i.e. the yen in the case of our Japanese subsidiary) and the
corresponding non-functional currency transactions (i.e. receivables
denominated in the U.S. dollar in the case of our Japanese subsidiary). We
hedge the following types of non-functional-currency-denominated balances and
transactions: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments
forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings
and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future
intercompany invoices denominated in the Euro and British pound. A description
of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 of

The amounts shown in the tables include the balances
and transactions described above. The maximum original duration of the currency
contracts shown is 15 months for our Euro forward contracts, 12 months for our
British pound forward contracts and one month for other currencies. Due to the
short

-

term nature of these contracts, the
contract rates approximate fair value as of October 31, 2006 and 2005.

The success of our hedging activities depends upon the
accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in
non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and
losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses
and gains on the underlying transactions.

For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10%
compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward
contracts listed in the table above providing information as of October 31,
2006, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $6.9
million, and we would be required to pay approximately $6.9 million to the
counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of
our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash
flow of approximately $6.9 million that would offset the loss and negative cash
flow on the maturing forward contracts.

Net unrealized losses of approximately $2.1 million
and $0.6 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive
loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2006 and October 31,
2005, respectively.

If our estimates of our balances and transactions
prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain
or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Synopsys
reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of SFAS 133,
resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to
certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error
was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of
Synopsys’ hedging program. To correct the error, Synopsys reclassified the
remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other
comprehensive loss to other income in the three months ended January 31,
2005.


Foreign currency contracts entered into in connection
with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be
unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We have limited these agreements to
major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk. Furthermore, we
monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution. We do not
enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes.

Equity
Risk.

Our
strategic investment portfolio as of October 31, 2006 consists of
approximately $4.9 million of minority equity investments in publicly
traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately
$8.1 million as of October 31, 2005. The securities of publicly
traded companies are generally classified as available-for-sale securities
accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,

and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or
losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
loss in stockholders’ equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are
reported at the lower of cost or fair value. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we
reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $1.3 million
and $4.5 million, respectively. During the fiscal year ended October 31,
2006, the prior investments of $1.9 million and $1.7 million in HPL and Virtio
were included in the purchase price. None of our investments in our strategic
investment portfolio are held for trading purposes. See Note 3 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further
discussion.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders

Synopsys, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended October 31, 2006. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2006
and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2006, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
Payment

, on November 1, 2005.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting of Synopsys, Inc.
as of October 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), and our report dated January 11, 2007, expressed an unqualified
opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal
control over financial reporting.

development and production of complex systems-on-chips (SoCs). In addition, the
Company provides intellectual property (IP) and design services to simplify the
design process and accelerate time to market for our customers. Finally, the
Company provides software and services that help customers prepare and optimize
their designs for manufacturing.

Note 2.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal
Year End.

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest October 31. All fiscal
years presented were 52-week years. Fiscal 2007 will be a 53-week
fiscal year. For presentation purposes, the consolidated financial statements
and notes refer to the calendar month end.

Principles
of Consolidation.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all
of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.

Basis
of Presentation.

Certain immaterial amounts in
prior year financial statements have been reclassified to the current year
presentation. In particular, the Company has reclassified prior year share-based
compensation charges into the related functional classifications in the
consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows. In
addition, the Company reclassified prior year compensation charges relating to
the Company’s deferred compensation plans from other income (expense) into the
related functional classifications in the consolidated statements of operations.
These reclassifications had no impact on net income (loss) for each of the
reporting periods presented.

Revisions
of Prior Year Financial Statements.

In fiscal 2006, the Company
identified errors which affected the income tax provision in fiscal years 2001
through 2005. The Company concluded that these errors were not material to any
such prior year financial statements. Although the errors are not material to
prior periods, the Company elected to revise prior year financial statements to
correct such errors. The fiscal periods in which the errors originated, and the
resulting change in provision (benefit) for income taxes for each such year,
are disclosed in Note 9.

Foreign
Currency Translation.

The
functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the
foreign subsidiary’s local currency except for the Company’s principal Irish
and Swiss subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the United States (U.S.)
dollar. Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional
currency are remeasured into the functional currency with any related gain or
loss recorded in earnings. The Company translates assets and liabilities of its
foreign operations, except its principal Irish and Swiss subsidiaries, into the
U.S. dollar reporting currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date. The Company translates income and expense items of its foreign operations
into U.S. dollars reporting currency at average exchange rates for the period.
Accumulated net translation adjustments are reported in stockholders’ equity,
net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Use
of Estimates.

To
prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts


reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Fair
Values of Financial Instruments.

The fair value of the Company’s
cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and foreign
currency contracts, approximates the carrying amount due to the short duration.
Long-term marketable equity investments are valued based on quoted market prices.
Non-marketable equity securities are valued at cost. The Company performs
periodic impairment analysis over these non-marketable equity securities.

Cash
Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.

The Company classifies investments
with original maturities of three months or less when acquired as cash
equivalents. All of the Company’s short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net of tax. Those unrealized gains or losses deemed other
than temporary are reflected in other income, net. The cost of securities sold
is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses
are included in other income, net. The Company has cash equivalents and
investments with various high quality institutions and, by policy, limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one institution.

Concentration
of Credit Risk.

The
Company sells its products worldwide primarily to customers in the global
electronics market. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition and does not require collateral. The Company
establishes reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been
within management’s expectations and have not been material in any year
presented.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts.

Trade accounts receivable are recorded
at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. We maintain allowances for
doubtful accounts to reduce the Company’s receivables to their estimated net
realizable value. The Company provides a general reserve on all accounts
receivable based on a review of accounts and a 15 quarter average of write
offs, net of recoveries. Such losses have been within management’s expectations
and have not been material in any year presented. The following table presents
the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Income
Taxes.

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109). Under the asset
and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is recorded
at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Assets are depreciated
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from
three to eight years and not to exceed 30 years for buildings. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of
remaining term of the lease or the economic


useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter.
Amortization and depreciation expense was $55.0 million in 2006, $52.7 million
in 2005 and $53.0 million in 2004. The cost of repairs and maintenance is
charged to operations as incurred and was $16.4 million, $17.4 million
and $16.1 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company
evaluates the recoverability of its property, equipment and intangible assets
whenever indications of impairment exist in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(SFAS 144),
and records an impairment charge against income as appropriate. A detail of
property and equipment is as follows:

During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company entered into a sale agreement with a third
party to sell a parcel of land in San Jose, California. The land, with a book
value of $23.4 million as of October 31, 2006, has been reclassified from
property, plant and equipment and reported as an asset held-for-sale within
prepaid expense and other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Software
Development Costs.

Capitalization
of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility, which is generally the completion of a working prototype and ends
upon general release of the product. Capitalized software development costs
were approximately $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $2.7 million in
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amortization of software development
costs is computed based on the straight-line method over the software’s
estimated economic life of approximately two years. The Company recorded
software amortization costs of $3.0 million, $2.7 million and
$2.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill
represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of
the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by the Company. The
goodwill recorded as a result of the business combinations in the years
presented is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is not amortized, but
rather is tested for impairment annually in the Company’s fiscal third quarter.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(SFAS 142), the
carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review. With the adoption of
SFAS 142, the Company determined that there was a single reporting unit for the
purpose of goodwill impairment tests under SFAS

142. For purposes of assessing the
impairment of goodwill, the Company estimates the value of the reporting unit
using its market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value. This fair
value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. In
addition, the carrying value of goodwill maybe affected by the settlement of
tax contingencies or the recognition of tax benefits from acquired companies in
periods subsequent to the acquisition date. During the fiscal years ended October 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, there were no impairments to goodwill. As of October 31,
2006, the carrying amount of our goodwill was $735.6 million.

Intangible assets consist of purchased technology,
contract rights intangibles, customer installed base/relationships, trademarks
and tradenames, covenants not to compete, customer backlog, capitalized
software and other intangibles. Intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated


useful lives which range
from two to ten years. Amortization of intangible assets was
$59.4 million, $116.1 million and $136.4 million in fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company continually monitors events and
changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of the long-lived
assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events
or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of
long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will
be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flow. If the future
undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of these assets, the
Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value of the assets. The Company did not recognize
intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. As of October 31,
2006, the carrying amount of our intangible assets was $106.1 million.

Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The Company records comprehensive income in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income (Loss)

,
which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income
(loss) and its components in the financial statements. Comprehensive income
(loss), as defined, includes all changes in equity during a period from
non-owner sources, such as accumulated net translation adjustments, unrealized
gains on certain foreign currency forward contracts that qualify as cash flow
hedges and reclassification adjustments related to unrealized gains on investments.
Reclassification adjustments decrease other comprehensive income for gains on
the sale of available-for-sale securities realized during the current year and
are included in other comprehensive income (loss) as unrealized holding gains
in the period in which such unrealized gains arose.

Revenue
Recognition.

The
Company recognizes revenue from software licenses and maintenance and service
revenue. Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the
licensing of Company software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of
maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional
service fees.

The Company has designed and implemented revenue
recognition policies in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, as amended

.


With respect to
software licenses, the Company utilizes three license types:

·

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

,
are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer
limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed
software for, unspecified future technology. The Company bundles and does not
charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for
the term of the license.

·

Term licenses

, are also for a finite term,
but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed
software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance
separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the
term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the
net license fee.

·

Perpetual licenses

, continue as long as
the customer renews maintenance, plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual
licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange
licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase
maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually.

For the three
software license types, the Company recognizes revenue as follows:

·

TSLs

.   The Company typically
recognizes revenue from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably
over the term of the license period, or, if later, as customer installments
become due and payable. All TSLs are reported as “time-based licenses.”

·

Term Licenses

.   The Company
recognizes the term license fee in full upon shipment of the software if
payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the term license fee
within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are
met. These term licenses are reported as “upfront licenses.” For term licenses
in which less than 75% of the term license fee is due within one year from
shipment, the Company recognizes revenue as customer installments become due
and payable. These due and payable term licenses are reported as “time-based
licenses.”

·

Perpetual Licenses

.   The Company
recognizes the perpetual license fee in full upon shipment of the software if
payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the perpetual license
fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria
are met. These perpetual licenses are reported as upfront licenses. For
perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee is payable within
one year from shipment, the Company recognizes the revenue as customer
installments become due and payable. These perpetual licenses are reported as “time-based
licenses.”

The Company’s determination of fair value of each
element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective
evidence (VSOE). The Company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to
the price charged when such element is sold separately.

The Company has analyzed all of the elements included
in its multiple-element software arrangements and has determined that it has
sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of its
perpetual and term license products and to consulting. Accordingly, assuming
all other revenue recognition criteria are met, the Company recognizes license
revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual
method, the Company recognizes revenue from maintenance ratably over the
maintenance term, and recognizes revenue from consulting services as the
related services are performed and accepted. The Company recognizes revenue
from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue
recognition criteria are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to allocate
the TSL fee between license and maintenance services.

The Company makes
significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection
with each transaction involving its products, the Company must evaluate
whether: (i) persuasive evidence


of an
arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of software or services has occurred, (iii) the
fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility
of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must
be met in order for the Company to recognize revenue with respect to a
particular arrangement. The Company applies these criteria as follows:

·

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists

.   Prior
to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, the Company’s customary policy is to
have a written contract, signed by both the customer and the Company or a
purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard
end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement.

·

Delivery Has Occurred

.   The Company
delivers software to our customers physically or electronically. For physical
deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. For
electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when the Company provides the customer
access codes, or “license keys,” that allow the customer to take immediate
possession of the software by downloading it to the customer’s hardware. The
Company generally ships its software products promptly after acceptance of
customer orders. However a number of factors can affect the timing of product
shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the
delivery dates requested by customers and the Company’s operational capacity to
fulfill software license orders at the end of a quarter.

·

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable

.   The
Company’s determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable
depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. The Company’s standard
payment terms require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one
year. If the arrangement includes these terms, the Company regards the fee as
fixed or determinable, and recognizes all license revenue under the arrangement
in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met).
If the arrangement does not include these terms, the Company does not consider
the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognizes revenue when
customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, the Company
recognizes revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable, due to the
fact that VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL and due to
revenue recognition criteria relating to arrangements that include rights to
exchange products or receive unspecified future technology.

·

Collectibility is Probable

.   The
Company must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees on a
customer-by-customer basis pursuant to its credit review policy. The Company
typically sells to customers with whom it has a history of successful
collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially
expands its commitments to the Company, the Company evaluates the customer’s
financial position and ability to pay and typically assigns a credit limit
based on that review. The Company increases the credit limit only after it has
established a successful collection history with the customer. If the Company
determines at any time that collectibility is not probable under a particular
arrangement based upon its credit review process or the customer’s payment
history, the Company recognizes revenue under that arrangement as customer
payments are actually received.

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128,

Earnings per Share

(SFAS 128), the Company computes basic income (loss) per share by dividing net
income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share
reflects the dilution of potential common shares outstanding such as stock
options and unvested restricted stock during the period using the treasury
stock method.

Diluted net income per share excludes 24.1 million,
27.1 million and 10.8 million anti-dilutive options and unvested restricted
stock for the year ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. While
these options and unvested restricted stock were anti-dilutive for the
respective periods, they could be


dilutive in the future. No
stock options were considered dilutive for the fiscal year ended 2005 as a
result of the Company’s net loss for the period.

Share-Based
Compensation.

On November 1, 2005, the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)),
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on
estimated fair value for all share-based payment awards including stock
options, employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans,
non-vested share awards (such as restricted stock) and stock appreciation
rights. SFAS 123(R) supersedes SFAS 123,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,

(SFAS 123). The Company elected
the modified prospective transition method, under which prior periods are not
restated for comparative purposes to reflect the impact of SFAS 123(R). The
modified prospective transition method requires that share-based compensation
expense be recorded for (a) any share-based payments granted through, but
not yet vested as of October 31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) any
share-based payments granted or modified subsequent to October 31, 2005,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS 123(R). In March 2005, the Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), which provided supplemental implementation
guidance for SFAS 123(R). The Company has applied the provisions of SAB 107 in
its adoption of SFAS 123(R).

SFAS 123(R) requires companies to estimate the
fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of the grant using an
option-pricing model. The value of awards expected to vest is recognized as
expense over the applicable service periods. Prior to November 1, 2005,
the Company accounted for its share-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25) and related guidance. Under
the intrinsic value method, the Company did not recognize any significant
amount of share-based compensation expense in the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations, as options granted under those plans had an exercise
price equal to the market value on the date of grant.

The adoption of SFAS 123(R) has had a material
effect on the Company’s reported financial results. The Company recorded
approximately $63.0 million of share-based compensation expense for the year
ended October 31, 2006. For fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, share-based
compensation expense related primarily to acquisitions and employee stock
option price adjustments in the amount of $6.2 million and $3.4 million,
respectively, under APB 25. There was no share-based compensation related to
employee stock purchases recognized during 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Foreign
Currency Contracts.

The
Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse
movements in currency exchange rates. The Company enters into foreign currency
forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on
non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet
positions. These foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value, and are
denominated primarily in the Euro and the Japanese yen. The maximum original
duration is


15 months for our Euro
forward contracts, 12 months for our British pound forward contracts, and one
month for other currencies. As of October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company had $185.3 million, $163.9 million and $65.6 million,
respectively, of short-term foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. Due
to the short term nature of these contracts, the contract rates approximate
fair value as of October 31, 2006 and 2005.

The components of the Company’s foreign currency
forward contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as cash
flow hedges, with gains and losses recorded in stockholders’ equity and
reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted transactions affect
earnings. As of October 31, 2006, an unrealized loss of approximately
$2.1 million is recorded in stockholders’ equity, net of tax, as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The maximum length of time
over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future
cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately three years.

Hedging effectiveness is evaluated monthly using spot
rates, with any gain or loss caused by hedging ineffectiveness reclassified to
earnings as other income (expense). The premium/discount component of the
forward contracts is recorded to other income (expense) and is not included in
evaluating hedging effectiveness.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company
reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivatives and Hedging

(SFAS 133), resulting in the discovery
of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign
currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error was not material in any
prior period and did not impact the economics of Synopsys’ hedging program. To
correct the error, Synopsys reclassified the remaining $3.0 million related to
the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income
in the three months ended January 31, 2005.

The earnings impact of gains and losses on foreign currency forward
contracts, net of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, was
immaterial for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Warranties and Indemnities.

The Company typically warrants its
products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to
material specifications for a period of 90 days. The Company also
indemnifies its customers from third party claims of intellectual property
infringement relating to the use of its products and is currently defending
some of its customers against claims that their use of one of its products
infringes a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. The Company is
unable to estimate the potential impact of these guarantees on the future
results of operations. To date, the Company has not been required to pay any
material warranty claims.


Note 3.

Business
Combinations

Purchase
Combinations.

During
the fiscal years presented, the Company made a number of purchase acquisitions.
For each acquisition, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated value
of the net tangible assets acquired was allocated to various intangible assets,
consisting primarily of developed technology, customer and contract-related
assets and goodwill. The values assigned to developed technologies related to
each acquisition were based upon future discounted cash flows related to the
existing products’ projected income streams. Goodwill, representing the excess
of the purchase consideration over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired in the acquisitions, will not to be amortized. Goodwill is not
deductible for tax purposes. The amounts allocated to purchased in-process
research and developments were determined through established valuation
techniques in the high-technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition
because technological feasibility had not been established and no future
alternative uses existed.

The consolidated financial
statements include the operating results of each business from the date of
acquisition. The Company does not consider these acquisitions to be material to
its results of operations and is therefore not presenting pro forma statements
of operations for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Fiscal 2006
Acquisitions

SIGMA-C Software AG
(Sigma-C)

The Company acquired Sigma-C on August 16, 2006
in an all-cash transaction.

Reasons
for the Acquisition.

Sigma-C provides simulation software that allows
semiconductor manufacturers and their suppliers to develop and optimize process
sequences for optical lithography, e-beam lithography and next-generation
lithography technologies. The Company believes the acquisition will enable a
tighter integration between design and manufacturing tools, allowing the
Company’s customers to perform more accurate design layout analysis with 3D
lithography simulation and better understand issues that affect IC wafer
yields.

Purchase Price.

The
Company paid $20.5 million in cash for the outstanding shares and shareholder
notes of which $2.05 million was deposited with an escrow agent and will be
paid per the escrow agreement. The Company believes that the escrow amount will
be paid. The total purchase consideration consisted of:

Acquisition-related costs of $2.1 million consist
primarily of legal, tax and accounting fees, estimated facilities closure costs
and employee termination costs. As of October 31, 2006, the Company had
paid $0.9 million of the acquisition-related costs. The $1.2 million
balance remaining at October 31, 2006 primarily consists of legal, tax and
accounting fees, estimated facilities closure costs and employee termination
costs.

Assets Acquired.

The
Company performed a preliminary valuation and allocated the total purchase
consideration to assets and liabilities. The Company acquired $6.0 million of
intangible assets consisting of $3.9 million in existing technology, $1.9
million in customer relationships and $0.2 million in trade names to be
amortized over five years. The Company also acquired assets of $3.9 million and
assumed liabilities of $5.1 million as result of this transaction. Goodwill,
representing the excess of the purchase price over the


fair value of the
tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, was $17.7 million.
Goodwill resulted primarily from the Company’s expectation of synergies from
the integration of Sigma-C’s technology with the Company’s technology and
operations.

Virtio Corporation, Inc.
(Virtio)

The Company acquired Virtio on May 15, 2006 in an
all-cash transaction.

Reasons
for the Acquisition.

The Company believes that
its acquisition of Virtio will expand its presence in electronic system level
design. The Company expects the combination of the Company’s System Studio
solution with Virtio’s virtual prototyping technology will help accelerate
systems to market by giving software developers the ability to begin code
development earlier than with prevailing methods.

Purchase Price.

The Company paid $9.1 million in
cash for the outstanding shares of Virtio, of which $0.9 million was deposited
with an escrow agent and which will be paid to the former stockholders of
Virtio pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement. In addition, the Company
had a prior investment in Virtio of approximately $1.7 million. The total
purchase consideration consisted of:

Acquisition-related costs of $0.7 million consist
primarily of legal, tax and accounting fees, estimated facilities closure costs
and employee termination costs. As of October 31, 2006, the Company had
paid $0.3 million of the acquisition-related costs. The $0.4 million
balance remaining at October 31, 2006 primarily consists of professional
and tax-related service fees and facilities closure costs.

Under the agreement with Virtio, the Company has also
agreed to pay up to $4.3 million over three years to the former stockholders
based upon achievement of certain sales milestones. This contingent
consideration is considered to be additional purchase price and will be an
adjustment to goodwill when and if payment is made. Additionally, the Company
has also agreed to pay $0.9 million in employee retention bonuses which will be
recognized as compensation expense over the service period of the applicable
employees.

Assets
Acquired.

The
Company has performed a preliminary valuation and allocated the total purchase
consideration to the assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable
intangible assets based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date.
The Company acquired $2.5 million of intangible assets consisting of $1.9 million
in existing technology, $0.4 million in customer relationships and $0.2 million
in non-compete agreements to be amortized over five to seven years. Additionally,
the Company acquired tangible assets of $5.5 million and assumed liabilities of
$3.2 million.

Goodwill, representing the
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired in the merger, was $6.7 million.
Goodwill resulted primarily from the Company’s expectation of synergies from
the integration of Virtio’s technology with the Company’s technology and
operations.

HPL Technologies, Inc.
(HPL)

The Company acquired HPL on December 7, 2005 in
an all-cash transaction.

Reasons
for the Acquisition.

The
Company believes that the acquisition of HPL will help solidify the Company’s
position as a leading electronic design automation vendor in design for
manufacturing (DFM)


software and will give the
Company a comprehensive design-to-silicon flow that links directly into the
semiconductor manufacturing process. Integrating HPL’s yield management and
test chip technologies into the Company’s industry-leading DFM portfolio is
also expected to enable customers to increase their productivity and improve
profitability in the design and manufacture of advanced semiconductor devices.

Purchase Price.

The Company paid $11.0 million in
cash for all outstanding shares of HPL. In addition, the Company had a prior
investment in HPL of approximately $1.9 million. The total purchase
consideration consisted of:

Acquisition-related costs of $2.8 million consist
primarily of legal, tax and accounting fees of $1.6 million, $0.3 million
of estimated facilities closure costs and other directly related charges, and
$0.9 million in employee termination costs. As of October 31, 2006,
the Company had paid $2.2 million of the acquisition related costs, of which
$1.1 million were for professional services costs, $0.2 million were for
facilities closure costs and $0.9 million were for employee termination costs.
The $0.6 million balance remaining at October 31, 2006 consists of
professional and tax-related service fees and facilities closure costs.

Assets
Acquired.

The
Company acquired $8.5 million of intangible assets consisting of $5.1 million
in core developed technology, $3.2 million in customer relationships and $0.2
million in backlog to be amortized over two to four years. Approximately $0.8
million of the purchase price represents the fair value of acquired in-process
research and development projects that have not yet reached technological
feasibility and have no alternative future use. Accordingly, the amount was
immediately expensed and included in the Company’s condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Additionally,
the Company acquired tangible assets of $14.0 million and assumed liabilities
of $10.9 million.

Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired in the merger was $3.4 million. Goodwill resulted primarily
from the Company’s expectation of synergies from the integration of HPL’s
technology with the Company’s technology and operations.

Other.

During the fiscal year 2006, the Company completed an
asset acquisition for cash consideration of $1.5 million. This acquisition is
not considered material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and results
of operations.

Fiscal 2005
Acquisitions

Nassda Corporation
(Nassda)

The Company acquired Nassda on May 11, 2005.

Reasons
for the Acquisition.

The Company believes

Nassda’s full-chip circuit
simulation and analysis software will broaden its offerings of transistor-level
circuit simulation tools, particularly in the area of mixed-signal and memory
design.

Purchase
Price.

The
Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Nassda for total cash
consideration of $200.2 million, or $7.00 per share. In addition, as required
by the merger agreement, certain Nassda officers, directors and employees who
were defendants in certain preexisting litigation


between Synopsys and
Nassda made settlement payments to Synopsys in the aggregate amount of $61.6 million.

Net of the settlement payments described above, the
Company paid $138.6 million in cash to the former shareholders of Nassda.
However, in accordance with

EITF 04-01,
Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business
Combination,

the Company must separately value the settlement of the
previously existing Nassda litigation and the business combination. The Company
determined the fair value of the settlement to be $33 million and recorded this
amount as other non-operating income. The Company valued the net assets
acquired from Nassda in the business combination at $196.9 million. The total
purchase price includes $13.2 million in acquisition-related costs and $12.1 million
in vested stock options assumed.

Acquisition-related costs of $13.2 million consist
primarily of professional service fees of $11.0 million, which include legal,
tax and accounting fees; a $1.8 million class action settlement which was
required to be settled prior to the closing of the acquisition, plus $0.5
million in associated legal costs; approximately $1.0 million in severance
costs for employee termination, and other directly related charges. As of October 31,
2006, the Company has paid substantially all the costs related to this
acquisition.

The
Company allocated the total purchase consideration to the assets and
liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their
respective fair values at the acquisition date. The following table summarizes
the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities
acquired.

Goodwill,
representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the merger was $92.4
million. During fiscal year 2006, reversal of $0.5 million acquisition related
costs and $2.6 million tax related adjustments resulted in a reduction in
goodwill. As of October 31, 2006, the goodwill acquired resulting from the
acquisition of Nassda was $89.3 million. The portion of the purchase price
allocated to identifiable intangible assets is as follows:

years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005.

ISE Integrated
Systems Engineering AG (ISE)

The Company acquired ISE on November 2, 2004.

Reasons
for the Acquisition.

ISE’s
Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) software performs process simulation
and device and circuit simulation, helping semiconductor manufacturers shorten
the time needed to design chips and to test those designs prior to actual
manufacturing. In approving the merger agreement, Synopsys’ Board considered a
number of factors, including its opinions that (i) the merger of ISE’s
TCAD organization with Synopsys’ own TCAD business will permit the introduction
of a consolidated TCAD platform that addresses the challenges posed by future
technologies while maintaining continuity with existing software, and (ii) the
merger will enable the Company to help further reduce its customers’ costs and
manufacturing risks as they create smaller, faster and more power-efficient
chips.

Purchase Price.

The
Company paid $100.0 million in cash for the outstanding shares of ISE. The
total purchase consideration consisted of:

Under the acquisition agreement, the Company has also
agreed to pay up to $20 million over three years to certain former shareholders
and option holders of ISE now employed by Synopsys based upon achievement of
certain sales and employee retention milestones. Amounts payable under this
arrangement will be accrued as compensation expense over the remaining expected
service period when and if management deems it probable such amounts will be
earned by the applicable milestone dates. The Company paid $7.0 million during November 2005
and $6.5 million during November 2006 under the agreement for achievement
against the first and second- year milestones, respectively.

Acquisition-related costs of $2.6 million consist
primarily of legal, tax and accounting fees of $1.3 million, approximately
$1.1 million of estimated facilities closure costs and other directly related
charges. During fiscal 2006, the Company reversed $1.0 million of acquisition
costs related primarily to


employee severance,
facilities closure and other contract terminations. The $0.1 million balance
remaining at October 31, 2006 primarily relates to professional services.

The
Company has allocated the total purchase consideration to the assets and liabilities
acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their respective
fair values at the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the

million. During fiscal year 2006, reversal of $1.0 million acquisition related
costs and $3.9 million tax related adjustments resulted in a change in
goodwill. As of October 31, 2006 the goodwill acquired resulting from the
acquisition of ISE was $75.9 million. The portion of the purchase price
allocated to identifiable intangible assets is as follows:

The in-process research and development (IPRD) expense
related to the ISE acquisition was $5.7 million. ISE had one IPRD project—FLOOPS,
a next generation process simulator.

Other.

During fiscal 2005, the Company completed two
additional asset acquisitions during fiscal 2005 for aggregate consideration of
$3.0 million. These acquisitions are not considered material, individually or
in the aggregate, to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and results of
operations.


Fiscal 2004
Acquisitions

In February 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Accelerant Networks, Inc.
(Accelerant) for total consideration of $23.8 million, and the acquisition of the
technology assets of Analog Design Automation, Inc. (ADA) for total
consideration of $12.2 million. The Company acquired Accelerant in order to
enhance the Company’s standards-based IP solutions. The Company acquired
the assets of ADA in order to enhance the Company’s analog and mixed signal
offerings.

In October 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of Cascade Semiconductor Solutions, Inc. (Cascade) for total
upfront consideration of $15.8 million and contingent consideration of up
to $10.0 million to be paid upon the achievement of certain performance
milestones over the three years following the acquisition. Contingent
consideration totaling $2.1 million was paid during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005 and has been allocated to goodwill. The Company acquired Cascade,
an IP provider, in order to augment Synopsys’ offerings of PCI Express
products. Included in the total consideration for the Accelerant and Cascade
acquisitions are aggregate acquisition costs of $4.3 million, consisting
primarily of legal and accounting fees and other directly related charges. As
of October 31, 2006 the Company has paid substantially all the costs
related to these acquisitions.

In fiscal 2004, the Company completed one additional
acquisition and two additional asset acquisition transactions for aggregate
consideration of $12.3 million in upfront payments and acquisition-related
costs. In process research and development expenses associated with these
acquisitions totaled $1.6 million for fiscal 2004. These acquisitions are not
considered material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet and results of operations. As of October 31,
2006, the Company has paid substantially all the costs related to these
acquisitions.

The Company allocated the
total aggregate purchase consideration for these transactions to the assets and
liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their
respective fair values at the acquisition dates, resulting in aggregate
goodwill of $24.5 million. Aggregate identifiable intangible assets as a
result of these acquisitions, consisting primarily of purchased technology and
other intangibles, are $44.8 million, and are being amortized over three
to five years. The Company includes the amortization of purchased technology in
cost of revenue in its statements of operations.

As of October 31,
2006, the stated maturities of the Company’s current investments are
$51.6 million within one year, $91.2 million within one to five
years, $10.5 million within five to ten years and $88.7 million after
ten years. Actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because
borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. These
investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the
balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as
a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.
Realized gains and losses on sales of short-term investments have not been
material in any period presented.

Strategic Investments.

The Company’s strategic investment
portfolio consists of minority equity investments in publicly traded companies
and investments in privately held companies. The securities of publicly traded
companies are classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115),

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or
losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. Securities of privately held companies are
reported at cost. As of October 31, 2006, the carrying value of the
Company’s strategic investments was $4.9 million.

During the years ended October 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 the Company determined that certain strategic investments
with an aggregate value of $1.3 million, $6.5 million and
$3.5 million, respectively, were impaired and that the impairment was
other than temporary. Accordingly, the Company recorded charges of
approximately $1.3 million, $4.5 million and $3.0 million during
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to write down the carrying value of
these investments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, the
prior investments of $1.9 million and $1.7 million in HPL and Virtio were
included in the purchase price and allocated to the net assets acquired of
these entities in fiscal 2006. See Note 3 for further discussion.

Notes Payable.

As
of October 31, 2006, and 2005, the Company’s notes payable totaled $8.6
million and $7.5 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of promissory
notes payable in September 2007 issued in connection with an acquisition
in September 2002 and notes to secure bonds related to certain property
taxes. In connection with the notes to secure bonds, in the ordinary course of
business, tax liens have been imposed upon certain land owned by the Company by
a governmental agency. To date, the Company has made all applicable payments
against these notes.

Credit Facility.

On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into a
five-year, $300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing
for loans to the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The facility
replaces the Company’s previous $250.0 million senior unsecured credit
facility, which was terminated effective October 20, 2006. The amount of
the facility may be increased by up to an additional $150.0 million through the
fourth year of the facility. The facility contains financial covenants
requiring the Company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels
of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on October 20,
2011. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the
administrative agent’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%;
however, the Company has the option to pay interest based on the outstanding
amount at Eurodollar rates plus a spread between 0.50% and 0.70% based on a
pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment fees are
payable on the facility at rates between 0.125% and 0.175% per year based on a
pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. As of October 31, 2006 the
Company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and was in
compliance with all the covenants.

Note 6.

Commitments and
Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain of its domestic and foreign
facilities and certain office equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements.
The facilities generally require the Company to pay property taxes,


insurance, maintenance and
repair costs. Rent expense was $38.6 million, $36.2 million and
$35.5 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has
the option to extend or renew most of its leases. In 2003, the Company
entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which the Company leases to a third
party a portion of its office space which the Company owns in Sunnyvale,
California. The lease agreement terminates in April 2009. The Company
receives monthly lease payments of $159,600 which are recorded as a reduction
of rent expense.

Future
minimum lease payments on all noncancelable operating leases with an initial
term in excess of one year, net of lease income, as of October 31, 2006

Legal Proceedings

Synopsys v. Magma
Design Automation, Inc.

In September 2004, the Company filed suit against
Magma Design Automation, Inc. (Magma) in U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California alleging infringement by Magma of three patents.
In April 2006, the parties proceeded to trial on the issue of ownership of
these patents (the Ownership Trial). As the ruling from the Ownership Trial remains
pending, in December 2006 the Company filed a motion for a preliminary
injunction to require Magma to withdraw its claim of ownership on the patents
considered during the Ownership Trial. In January 2007, the court granted
the Company’s motion and directed Magma to transfer record title to the Company.
The court has not yet issued a final ruling on the question of ownership. A
second trial (the Infringement Trial) will be required in order to determine
the relief that should issue in connection with any infringement of the Company’s
patents; however, the court has not yet scheduled the Infringement Trial.

In September 2005, the Company
filed two additional actions against Magma. One of the actions, filed in
the Superior Court of California and later removed to the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Magma engaged in
actions that constitute common law and statutory unfair business practices. In
that action Magma filed a motion to dismiss, which remains under submission. In
the remaining action the Company asserted three patents against Magma in
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. In its answer and
counterclaims, Magma asserted patents against the Company, and alleged that the
Company has engaged in various practices that constitute antitrust violations
and has violated various state laws. Magma seeks declaratory relief that the
patents asserted by the Company are invalid or unenforceable. Magma also seeks
an injunction prohibiting the Company from infringing the patents it has
asserted, and seeks unspecified damages. The Company has filed an answer
denying Magma’s allegations and asserting that the Magma patents at issue are
either unenforceable or invalid. A trial on these issues has been scheduled for
June 2007.


The Company believes
Magma’s claims in all actions are without merit and is vigorously
contesting them.

IRS Revenue Agent’s
Report

On June 8, 2005, the Company received a Revenue
Agent’s Report (RAR) in which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed to
assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately
$476.8 million, plus interest. Interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency
finally determined until paid, and compounds daily at the federal underpayment
rate, which adjusts quarterly.

This proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer
pricing transactions between the Company and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary.
The proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total amount
relating to these transactions asserted under the IRS theories.

On July 13, 2005, the
Company filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused
the matter to be referred to the Appeals Office of the IRS. The Company expects
to commence the appeals process in 2007. However, final resolution of this
matter could take a considerable time, possibly years. The Company strongly
believes the proposed IRS adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are
inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that the Company thus has meritorious
defenses to these proposals. Accordingly, the Company will continue to
challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. While the Company believes the
IRS’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law, the Company
believes it is probable the Company will be required to make additional
payments in order to resolve this matter. However, based on the Company’s
analysis to date, the Company believes the Company has adequately provided for
this matter. If the Company determines its 
provision for this matter to be inadequate or is required to pay a
significant amount of additional U.S. taxes and applicable interest in excess
of its provision for this matter, the Company results of operations and
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

Note 7.

Stockholders’
Equity

Stock
Repurchase Programs.

The Company is authorized to
repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock under a stock repurchase
program previously established by the Company’s Board in 2001. The stock
repurchase program had been renewed and replenished up to the $500 million
maximum annually through December 2004. The share repurchase program has
no expiration date. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company purchased 10
million shares at an average price of $19.94 per share, 5.1 million shares
at an average price of $17.20 per share, and 16.9 million shares at an
average price of $25.02 per share, respectively. The aggregate purchase prices
were $200 million, $88.4 million and $423.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, 4.7 million, 3.6 million
and 7.8 million shares were reissued respectively, for employee stock option
exercises and employee stock purchase plan requirements. As of October 31,
2006, $236.6 million remained available for further purchases under the
program.

Preferred Shares Rights
Plan.

The Company has adopted a number of
provisions that could have anti-takeover effects, including a Preferred Shares
Rights Plan. In addition, the Board of Directors has the authority, without
further action by its stockholders, to fix the rights and preferences and issue
shares of authorized but undesignated shares of Preferred Stock. This provision
and other provisions of the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may have the effect of
deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or
management of the Company, including transactions in which the stockholders of
the Company might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then
current market prices. The preferred share rights expire on October 24,
2007.


Note 8.

Employee
Benefit Plans

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

Under the Company’s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and International Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(collectively, the ESPP), employees are granted the right to purchase shares of
common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market
value of the shares at (1) the beginning of a rolling two-year offering
period or (2) the end of each semi-annual purchase period, subject to a
plan limit on the number of shares that may be purchased in a purchase period.
During the twelve months ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company issued 2,437,446, 2,107,556 and 1,898,402 shares, respectively, under
the ESPP at average per share prices of $13.73, $13.49 and $15.51 respectively.
As of October 31, 2006, 5,390,588 shares of common stock were reserved for
future issuance under the ESPP.

Stock Option Plans

2006 Employee
Equity Incentive Plan

On April 25,
2006, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2006 Employee Equity
Incentive Plan (the 2006 Employee Plan), which provides for the grant of
incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards,
restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights and other forms of
equity compensation as determined by the plan administrator. The 2006 Employee
Plan also provides the ability to grant performance stock awards and
performance cash awards. The terms and conditions of each type of award are set
forth in the 2006 Employee Plan. The Company expects that options granted under
this plan will have a term of seven years. As of October 31, 2006, an
aggregate of 973,335 stock options were outstanding under this plan.

As a result of the
stockholders’ approval of the 2006 Employee Plan, the Company’s 1992 Stock
Option Plan, 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan and 2005 Assumed Stock Option
Plan (collectively, the Prior Plans) have been terminated as to future
grants. Should any options currently outstanding under such plans and
plans assumed by the Company in acquisitions (34,933,727 as of October 31,
2006) expire unexercised, they shall become available for future grant under
the 2006 Employee Plan.

An aggregate of 47,497,248 shares are reserved for issuance under
the 2006 Employee Plan (inclusive of the options previously granted under the
Prior Plans and options assumed by the Company in acquisitions). An aggregate
of 10,666,393 shares were available for future issuance under the 2006 Employee
Plan as of October 31, 2006.

1992 Stock Option
Plan

Under the Company’s
1992 Stock Option Plan (the 1992 Plan), 38,866,356 shares of common stock were
originally authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1992 Plan, the Board of
Directors could grant either incentive or non-qualified stock options to purchase
shares of common stock to employees or consultants, excluding non-employee
directors, at not less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on
the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1992 Plan generally vest over a
period of four years and expire seven to ten years from the date of
grant. The 1992 Plan was terminated as to future grants in connection with
approval of the 2006 Employee Plan. As of October 31, 2006, 8,526,522
stock options remained outstanding under this plan.

Under the 1992 Plan, in December 2005 and January 2006,
certain executive officers of the Company were granted an aggregate of 420,000
stock options the vesting of which is contingent upon the Company meeting
certain operating margin performance goals in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. These
stock options have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant, contingently vest over two years
and have a term of seven years. In fiscal 2006, the operating margin performance
goal was achieved and, as a result 50% of these stock options become
exercisable.


Share-based compensation expense is
being recorded assuming that performance goals will be achieved in fiscal 2007.

1998 Non-Statutory
Stock Option Plan

Under the Company’s 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan (the 1998
Plan), 50,295,546 shares of common stock were originally authorized for
issuance. Pursuant to the 1998 Plan, the Board could grant nonqualified stock
options to employees or consultants, excluding executive officers.
Exercisability, option price and other terms were determined by the Board but
the option price could not be less than 100% of the fair market value of those
shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1998 Plan generally
vest over a period of four years and expire seven to ten years from the date of
grant. The 1998 Plan was terminated as to future grants in connection with
approval of the 2006 Employee Plan. As of October 31, 2006, 23,465,409
stock options remained outstanding under this plan.

2005 Assumed Stock
Option Plan

Under the Company’s 2005 Assumed Stock Option Plan (formerly, the
Nassda Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan), ( the 2005 Plan), an aggregate
of 3,427,529 shares of common stock were originally authorized for issuance.
Pursuant to the 2005 Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board or its
designee could grant nonqualified stock options to employees or consultants of
the Company who either were (1) not employed by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries on May 11, 2005 or (2) providing services to Nassda
Corporation (or any subsidiary corporation thereof) prior to May 11, 2005.
Exercisability, option price and other terms were determined by the Board but
the option price could not be less than 100% of the fair market value of those
shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan generally
vest over a period of four years and expire seven to ten years from the date of
grant. The 2005 Plan was terminated as to future grant in connection with
approval of the 2006 Employee Plan. As of October 31, 2006, 1,189,627
stock options remained outstanding under this plan.

2005 Non-Employee
Directors Equity Incentive Plan

On May 23, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2005
Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the 2005 Directors Plan) and the
reservation of 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance there under. The
Directors Plan provides for annual equity awards to non-employee directors in
the form of either stock options or restricted stock. Stockholders approved a
450,000 share increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the
Directors Plan on April 25, 2006. The Company issued non-employee
directors an aggregate of 34,512 shares of restricted stock at market
value of approximately $0.8 million in April 2006. An aggregate of 76,572
shares of restricted stock were granted under the plan as of October 31,
2006 with an aggregate value of approximately $1.5 million. The share-based
compensation expense related to these shares will be amortized over the vesting
period of three years. As of October 31, 2006, 50,964
shares were outstanding with weighted average fair value of $20.03 per share
and intrinsic value of $0.1 million. 673,428 shares of common stock were
reserved for future grant under the Directors Plan at October 31, 2006.

1994 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan

An aggregate of 1,080,162 stock options remained outstanding under
the Company’s 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan as of October 31,
2006, which expired as to future grants in October 2004.


Plans Assumed in Acquisitions

The Company has assumed certain option plans in connection with
business combinations with respect to stock options outstanding at the time of
such business combinations. Generally, the options granted under these plans
have terms similar to the Company’s own options. The exercise prices of such
options have been adjusted to reflect the relative exchange ratios. No
shares are reserved for future grant under these plans, although should
such options be canceled or expire unexercised, they shall become available for
future grant under the 2006 Employee Plan. As of October 31, 2006, an
aggregate of 1,752,169 such options were outstanding.

Option Exchange Program

In May 2005, the
Company’s stockholders approved an option exchange program under which
outstanding employee stock options (other than options held by executive
officers) with exercise prices of $25.00 or greater per share could be
exchanged for a lesser number of options granted at current fair market value
with a new vesting period. On June 23, 2005, the Company accepted for
cancellation options to purchase 7.3 million shares of common stock and in
exchange granted to eligible employees options to purchase 3.8 million shares
of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $17.16 per share, except
for small number of options issued with an exercise price of $18.06 due to
regional laws regarding the pricing of stock option grants. As a result of the
exchange, the Company recorded option expense of $0.6 million for the fiscal
year ended October 31, 2005 under the provisions of APB 25.

holders exercised their options as of that date. The pretax intrinsic values of
options exercised were $10.6 million, $7.1 million, and $88.2 million in fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were 26.4 million and 28.0 million
outstanding stock options exercisable with weighted-average exercise prices of
$20.60 and $22.06 at October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Valuation
and Expense of Stock Option and Employee Stock Purchase Plans.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase
plan awards per SFAS 123(R) which is consistent with that used for pro
forma disclosures under SFAS 123, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model is subject to certain limitations, since it
was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived
exchange-traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates
various and highly subjective assumptions including expected volatility,
expected term and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on
historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period
commensurate with the estimated expected term of the Company’s stock options.
The expected term of the Company’s stock options are based on its historical
experience.


The
assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted under our
stock option plans and stock purchase rights granted under our employee stock
purchase plans are as follows:

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company
provided the disclosures required under SFAS 123 and presented deferred
compensation as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. In accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 123(R), on November 1, 2005, the Company
reclassified the balance in deferred compensation to additional paid-in capital
on its balance sheet.

For
pro forma purposes, the estimated fair value of the Company’s stock-based
awards to employees is amortized over the options’ vesting period of four years
and the ESPP’s two-year offering period. The following table illustrates the
effect on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, net of tax
effects, for the year ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to share-based
awards:

The Company has revised
its fiscal year 2004 SFAS 123 pro forma stock compensation disclosure based on
the discovery of an error in accounting for a modification of its ESPP awards.
The error resulted in a $4.7 million increase to the stock compensation
expense determined under the fair value based method, and a respective increase
to pro forma net loss in fiscal 2004.

Under SFAS 123(R), the Company uses the straight-line
attribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the service
period of the award.

As of October 31, 2006, $79.1 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock awards is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

The share-based compensation expense of $6.2 million
includes $3.6 million related to an error in the Company’s stock option grant
process related to the documentation of grant dates for grants to non executive
officer employees in fiscal 2005.

The Company included all tax benefits for deductions
resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in its
statement of cash flows prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires
the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of
the compensation expense recorded for those options (excess tax benefits) to be
classified as cash from financing activities. To calculate the excess tax
benefits available for use in offsetting future tax shortfalls as of the date
of implementation, the Company follows the alternative transition method
discussed in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position
No. 123(R)-3. There was no material impact to the Company’s financial
statements upon adoption of the alternative transition method in the third
quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company has not recorded any excess tax benefits
during fiscal 2006.

Deferred
Compensation Plan.

The
Company maintains the Synopsys Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred
Plan”), which permits eligible employees to defer up to 50% of their annual
cash base compensation and up to 100% of their annual cash variable
compensation. Distributions from the Deferred Plan are generally payable upon
termination of employment over five to 15 years or as a lump sum payment at the
option of the employee. Since the inception of the Deferred Plan, the Company
has not made any matching or discretionary contributions to the Deferred Plan.
There are no Deferred Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or
minimum return on investments. Undistributed amounts under the Deferred Plan
are subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors. As of October 31,
2006 and 2005, the invested amounts under the Deferred Plan total to $62.5
million and $54.0 million, respectively, and are recorded as long-term other
assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of October 31,
2006 and 2005, the Company has recorded $65.8 million and $56.5 million,
respectively, as long-term liabilities to recognize undistributed deferred
compensation due to employees.


Synopsys 401(k) Plan.

The
Company sponsors various retirement plans for its eligible U.S. and non-U.S.
employees. Total contributions to these plans are charged to operations and
were $10.1 million, $10.2 million and $8.4 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. For employees in the U.S., the Company maintains the Synopsys 401(k) Savings
and Success Sharing Plan (the 401k Plan). As allowed under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the 401k Plan allows tax deferred salary deductions
of 1% to 30% of eligible annual salary by eligible employees. Employee
contributions are limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company matches pretax employee contributions up to 40% of
employee deferrals or a maximum of $1,500 per participant per year. Participants
who meet the age requirement before the close of the 401k Plan year may be
eligible to make catch-up salary deferral contributions, limited by the maximum
dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. Catch-up contributions are
not eligible for matching contributions.

The provision for income taxes for the year ended October 31,

tax audits settled and a settlement offer made in fiscal 2006 and associated
interest and penalties as well as a reduction in an estimated fiscal 2005 state
research and development credit benefit. In addition, as required by SFAS
123(R), no tax benefit was recorded in the year ended October 31, 2006 for
expenses relating to qualified stock options and share-based compensation costs
which are borne by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.

Net

The Company has federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $179.7 million as of October 31, 2006,
of which $77.0 million will expire in fiscal 2025, and $102.7 million from
acquired companies will expire between fiscal 2018 and 2025.

The Company has federal foreign tax credits of
$63.8 million of which $58.6 million will expire from fiscal 2013 through
2016 and the remaining $5.2 million in foreign tax credits from acquired
companies, which have a valuation allowance of $2.4 million will expire between
fiscal 2008 and 2011. The Company has federal research and development credits
of $25.2 million, of which $15.5 million will expire between fiscal 2022
and 2026 and $9.7 million from acquired companies will expire between fiscal
2007 and 2022.

The Company has a deferred tax asset of $17.2 million
relating to California research and development tax credit carryforwards, which
may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has also recorded a deferred
tax asset of $7.6 million relating to other state tax attributes carry forward
for which the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $2.6 million.

In evaluating its ability to utilize its deferred tax
assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence,
including its past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in
certain jurisdictions in the most recent fiscal years and its forecast of
future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31,
2006, the Company believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning
strategies will be sufficient to fully recover the net deferred tax assets.

As a result of a change in U.S. tax rules, in fiscal
2006, the Company changed its tax accounting method on its tax return for
fiscal 2005 with respect to the current portion of deferred revenue to follow
the recognition of revenue under generally accepted accounting principles. This
accounting method change resulted in a significant increase in the Company’s
net operating loss carryforwards and a corresponding decrease in deferred tax
asset relating to deferred revenue.

In fiscal 2006, the Company reduced additional paid to
capital by approximately $8.9 million. The decrease is primarily due to the
withdrawal of an incorrect state refund claim made in 2005 relating to stock
option deductions claimed for foreign employees and an overstatement in prior
years of the excess tax benefit realized from exercises of stock options
assumed in certain acquisitions.

Also, in fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a net
decrease to goodwill of $7.8 million to recognize additional deferred tax
assets, such as net operating losses from prior year acquisitions and to adjust
a deferred tax liability on an acquired intangible to the appropriate tax rate.
The Company also recorded a decrease to goodwill of $6.3 million to correctly
record the excess tax benefits realized from exercises of stock options assumed
in certain acquisitions.

In fiscal 2005, the Company released tax contingency
reserves totaling $34.0 million related to previously acquired companies
as a result of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation. These
released liabilities were recorded against acquisition goodwill with no effect
on the Company’s net loss in fiscal 2005.

The Company has not provided taxes for undistributed
earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the Company plans to reinvest such
earnings indefinitely outside the United States. If the cumulative foreign
earnings exceed the amount the Company intends to reinvest in foreign countries
in the future, the Company would provide taxes on such excess amount. As of October 31,
2006, there was approximately $31.0 million earnings upon which U.S. income
taxes have not been provided.

In May 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and
Reconciliation Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act) was enacted and provides a three-year
exception to current U.S. taxation of certain foreign intercompany income. The
provisions of the 2005 Act will first apply to the Company for its fiscal year
2007.


In December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care
Act of 2006 (the 2006 Act) was enacted, which retroactively extended the
research and development credit from January 1, 2006. As a result, we will
record an expected increase in fiscal 2006 R&D credit of between $1.5
million and $1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

Revision of Prior Year
Financial Statements.

As
a part of the Company’s remediation of the material weakness in internal
control over financial reporting identified in fiscal 2005 relating to accounting
for income taxes, the Company implemented additional internal control and
review procedures. Through such procedures, in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2006, the Company identified four errors totaling $8.2 million which affected
the income tax provision in fiscal years 2001 through 2005. The Company
concluded that these errors were not material to any prior year financial
statements. Although the errors are not material to prior periods, the Company elected
to revise such prior year financial statements to correct such errors. The
fiscal periods in which the errors originated, and the resulting change in
provision (benefit) for income taxes for each year, are reflected in the
following table:

Year Ended October 31






(in thousands)

$205

$

1,833

$

5,303

$

(748

)

$

1,636

The errors were as follows: (1) the Company
inadvertently provided a $1.4 million tax benefit for the write-off of goodwill
relating to an acquisition in fiscal 2002; (2) the Company did not accrue
interest and penalties for certain foreign tax contingency items in the amount
of $3.2 million; (3) the Company made certain computational errors
relating to foreign dividends of $2.3 million; and (4) the Company did not
record a valuation allowance relating to certain state tax credits of $1.3
million. As result of this revision, non-current deferred tax assets decreased
by $8.1 million and current tax payable increased by $0.2 million. Retained
earnings decreased by $8.2 million and additional paid in capital decreased by
$0.1 million.

Tax
Effects of Stock Awards.

In November 2005,
FASB issued a Staff Position (FSP) on FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards

. Effective upon issuance, this FSP
describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of
share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition
method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the
additional paid-in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of
employee share-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on
the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee
share-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS
123(R). The Company elected to use the alternative transition method in 2006. The
Company has not recognized any excess tax benefits during fiscal 2006.

IRS
Revenue Agent’s Report.

On June 8, 2005, the Company received a Revenue
Agent’s Report (RAR) in which the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) proposed to
assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately
$476.8 million, plus interest. Interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency
finally determined until paid, and compounds daily at the federal underpayment
rate, which adjusts quarterly. This proposed adjustment primarily relates to
transfer pricing transactions between the Company and a wholly-owned foreign
subsidiary. The proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total
amount relating to these transactions asserted under the IRS theories.

On July 13, 2005, the Company filed a protest to
the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the matter to be referred to
the Appeals Office of the IRS. The Company expects to commence the appeals
process in 2007. However, final resolution of this matter could take a
considerable time, possibly years. The Company strongly believes the proposed
IRS adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with
applicable tax laws, and that the Company thus has meritorious defenses to
these proposals. Accordingly, the Company will continue to challenge these
proposed adjustments vigorously. While it believes the IRS’ asserted
adjustments are not supported by applicable law, the Company believes


it is probable it will be
required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter. However,
based on the Company’s analysis to date, the Company believes it has adequately
provided for this matter. If the Company determines its provision for this
matter to be inadequate or the Company is required to pay a significant amount
of additional U.S. taxes and applicable interest in excess of its provision for
this matter, its results of operations and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

In the third quarter of 2006, the IRS started an
examination of the Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2002
through 2004. As of the end of fiscal 2006, no adjustments had been proposed as
a result of this audit.

Repatriation of foreign
earnings.

The American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act) provides for a special one-time elective
dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to
a U.S. taxpayer equal to 85% of the eligible distribution. During the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company repatriated $360.0 million, of which approximately
$185.0 million qualified for the special one-time elective dividends received
deduction and the balance of which constituted earnings that did not qualify
under the Jobs Creation Act, previously taxed income and return of capital. The
Company recorded tax expense of $11.6 million related to the repatriation of
$360 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company’s chief executive
officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan (DRIP) to invest up to $185.0
million in foreign earnings in qualified investments pursuant to the Jobs
Creation Act. As required by the 2004 Act, the reinvestment plan was ratified
by the Board of Directors in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company
satisfied the DRIP reinvestment requirements during fiscal 2005.

In the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Company re-evaluated its interpretation of certain provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging

(SFAS 133),
resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to
certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error
was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of the
Company’s hedging program. To correct the error, the Company reclassified the
remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other
comprehensive loss to other income during the year ended October 31, 2005.

(2)

For
the year ended October 31, 2006, these amounts are comprised primarily of
$5.5 million in investment earnings related to the change in the fair value of
the deferred compensation plan assets, partially offset by $3.0 million in
premiums paid on foreign exchange forward contracts. For the year ended

Segment
Disclosure

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information

, (SFAS 131) requires disclosures of
certain information regarding operating segments, products and services,
geographic areas of operation and major customers. SFAS 131 reporting is
based upon the “management approach,” i.e., how management organizes the
Company’s operating segments for which separate financial information is (1) available
and (2) evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Synopsys’
CODMs are the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating
Officer.

The
Company provides software products and consulting services in the electronic
design automation software industry. The Company operates in a single segment.
In making operating decisions, the CODMs primarily consider consolidated
financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues
by geographic region. Specifically, the CODMs consider where individual “seats”
or licenses to the Company’s products are used in allocating revenue to
particular geographic areas. Revenue is defined as revenues from external
customers. Goodwill is not allocated since the Company operates in one
reportable operating segment. Revenue and property and equipment, net related
to operations in the United States and other geographic areas were:

Termination
of Agreement to Acquire Monolithic System Technology, Inc.

On February 23, 2004, the Company entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire Monolithic System Technology, Inc. (MoSys)
in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $453 million.

On April 16, 2004, the Company exercised its
right to terminate the merger agreement and paid MoSys a $10.0 million
termination fee. The Company has included the termination fee in general and
administrative expense in the statement of operations for fiscal 2004. On April 23,
2004, MoSys filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court against Synopsys and
Mountain Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, alleging
that the Company improperly exercised its termination right.

On July 9, 2004, the
Company and MoSys announced a settlement under which the suit was dismissed
without further liability or payments to one another.

Related
Party and Other Transactions

During fiscal 2006, former Director Richard Newton
provided consulting services to the Company for which he was paid $180,000.
Under the Company’s agreement with Dr. Newton, Dr. Newton provided
advice concerning long-term technology strategy and industry development
issues as well as assistance in identifying opportunities for partnerships with
academia. Dr. Newton was a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science and Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California,
Berkeley. Effective September 6, 2006, the Company and Dr. Newton
amended the agreement between them. Pursuant to
the amended agreement, Dr. Newton’s annual compensation for
providing these services was reduced to $100,000 per year. During fiscal 2005
and 2004, Dr. Newton was paid $180,000 annually under his agreement with
the Company. Dr. Newton passed away on January 1, 2007.

Andy D. Bryant, Intel
Corporation’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Enterprise
Services Officer, served on the Company’s Board of Directors from January 1999
until May 2005. Revenues derived from Intel Corporation and its
subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of the
Company’s total revenue for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Management
believes all transactions between the two parties were carried out on an arm’s
length basis.


Note 14.

Effect
of New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

, (SAB 108). SAB
108 addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying
misstatements and provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the
effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements
for the purpose of a materiality assessment. The SEC staff believes that
registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet (iron curtain)
and an income statement (rollover) approach and evaluate whether either
approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant
quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. In the year
of adoption, SAB 108 allows a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment
for errors that were not previously deemed material, but are material under the
guidance in SAB 108. The guidance in SAB 108 must be applied to annual
financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The
Company will be required to adopt the provisions of SAB 108 in fiscal 2007. The
Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SAB 108 and the potential
impact upon adoption. Historically, the Company has evaluated uncorrected
differences utilizing the “rollover” approach. Although the Company believes
its prior period assessments of uncorrected differences utilizing the “rollover”
approach and the conclusion reached regarding its quantitative and qualitative
assessments of such uncorrected differences were appropriate, the Company
expects that, due to the analysis required in SAB 108, certain historical
uncorrected differences during fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2004 related to
share-based compensation and fixed assets, will be corrected upon adoption and
reflected in the opening retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007.

The Company has not yet completed its analysis of SAB
108, however, it estimates that the expected net reduction to the opening
retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007 will be approximately $10 to $12
million. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting SAB 108
and, as a result, the actual change to the opening retained earnings balance
for fiscal 2007 could be different than the estimate.

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (

SFAS 154), which
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in
accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting
principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net
income of the period of the change. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application
to prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine
either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. However,
SFAS 154 does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting
pronouncements. The provisions are effective for the Company beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2007.

In September 2006, FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an Amendment
of FASB Statements 87, 88, 106, and 132R

(SFAS 158). SFAS 158
requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be
recognized on the Company’s balance sheet, and changes in the funded status be
reflected in comprehensive income, effective fiscal years ending after December 15,
2006. The Company will be adopting all requirements of SFAS 158 in the fiscal
year ending October 31, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 158 is not expected to
have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

(SFAS 157). The purpose of SFAS 157 is to
define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and enhance
disclosures about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities of a
Company. The measurement and disclosure requirements are effective for the
Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company is currently
evaluating whether SFAS 157 will result in a change


to its fair value
measurements and has not yet determined the impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation Number 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN
48). The interpretation contains a two-step approach to recognizing and
measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with
SFAS 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition
by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes,
if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount
which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The
provisions are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2008. The Company has not determined the impact this interpretation
will have on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows in fiscal year 2008.

In February 2006, FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 155

Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments

—

an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 133 and 140

(SFAS 155), which amends SFAS No. 133

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

.
SFAS 155 provides a fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial
instruments containing an embedded derivative that would otherwise require
bifurcation. The requirements are effective for the Company beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2007. The adoption of SFAS 155 is not expected to have
a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In November 2005, FASB
issued Staff Position (FSP) FAS 115-1 /124-1,

The Meaning
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

.
This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered
impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement
of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations
subsequent to the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. The
provisions are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2007. The adoption of this FSP is not expected to have a material effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

During the fourth
quarters of fiscal 2006 and 2005, the company recorded $1.6 million and $3.6
million, respectively, in share-based compensation associated with grants to
employees in 2001 through 2005. The compensation should have been recognized
evenly throughout fiscal 2006 and 2005.

We have reclassified
certain prior year amounts relating to share-based compensation as detailed in
the statements of operations, statements of cash flows and in Note 8 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
fiscal 2006, we identified errors which affected our income tax provision in
fiscal years 2001 through 2005. We concluded that these errors were not
material to any prior year financial statements. Although the errors are not
material to prior periods, we elected to revise prior year financial statements
to correct such errors. The fiscal periods in which the errors originated, and
the resulting change in provision (benefit) for income taxes for each year, are
disclosed in Note 9 of

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

. The quarterly tax provisions for fiscal 2005
were also revised to correct the immaterial errors.

Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of October 31,
2006 (the Evaluation Date), Synopsys carried out an evaluation under the
supervision and with the participation of Synopsys’ management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of Synopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
system of disclosure controls and procedures.


Accordingly, even
effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not
absolute, assurance of achieving their control objectives. Nonetheless, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31,
2006, (1) Synopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures were designed to
provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and (2) Synopsys’
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports Synopsys
files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported as and when required, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to Synopsys’ management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding its required
disclosure.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

.   Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) for Synopsys.

Under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date. In making this
assessment, our management used the framework established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

Our management has
concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered
public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an auditors’ report on our
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included
herein.

(c)

Changes
in Internal Controls.

Our annual report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 disclosed a material weakness
relating to accounting for income taxes. In order to remediate this material
weakness, during fiscal 2006, we: (1) implemented additional recurring review
procedures to help ensure compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes

, SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
Contingencies

, and other applicable rules and regulations with
respect to tax matters, (2) engaged external tax advisors to assist in the
review of our income tax calculations, (3) implemented controls with
respect to tracking the statute of limitations, (4) increased contact and
coordination between members of the Corporate Tax Department and the Vice
President and Corporate Controller and other senior finance department
management; (5) completed a reorganization and increase in staffing in the
Corporate Tax department. As a result of these actions management has concluded
that Synopsys has remediated the material weakness. Other than as described
above, there were no changes in Synopsys’ internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended October 31, 2006 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Synopsys’
internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Synopsys, Inc.:

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A(b), that Synopsys, Inc.
(the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of October 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management of Synopsys, Inc.
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Teadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Teadway Commission (COSO).


We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of October 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss),
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31,
2006, and our report dated January 11, 2007, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

timely with respect to the exercise and sale of 6,015 options in June 2006
due to a broker communication error, and Paul Lo, Senior Vice President,
Analog/Mixed-Signal Group, failed to timely file a Form 3 reporting his
initial ownership of Synopsys securities in September 2006 due to a
Synopsys administrative error.

for 40,000 shares, which was granted under our 2006 Employee Equity Incentive
Plan (the 2006 plan). An aggregate of 3/48ths of the options become exercisable
three months after the grant date followed by 45 equal monthly installments,
assuming continued service to Synopsys, subject to acceleration under certain
circumstances involving a change in control of Synopsys. Each option has a
maximum term of seven years, subject to earlier termination upon the optionee’s
cessation of service. See Note 8 to

50% of the shares subject to the options shall vest when the first performance
condition is met and 50% of the shares subject to the options shall vest when
the second performance condition is met, assuming continued service to Synopsys

In
accordance with the rules of the SEC, the columns referring to potential
realizable value show the gains or “option spreads” that would exist for the
options granted based on the assumed rates of annual compound stock price
appreciation of 5% and 10% from the date the option was granted over the full
option term. These estimated rates do not represent our estimate or projection
of future common stock prices or of the gains that may actually be realized by
the optionee.

Director Compensation

Non-employee directors
receive a combination of cash and stock as compensation for Board service. Such
directors receive an annual retainer of $125,000. In addition, Audit Committee
members receive $2,000 ($4,000 in the case of the Chair) for each Audit
Committee meeting attended, up to a maximum of four meetings per year.

Non-employee directors
also receive equity compensation under the 2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity
Incentive Plan (the 2005 Directors Plan). The 2005 Directors Plan provides for
automatic grants to each non-employee member of our Board upon their
initial appointment or election and upon their reelection each year. The award
price per share is 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the
grant date. New non-employee directors receive a stock option for 30,000
shares, vesting in equal annual installments on the date preceding each of the
first four annual meetings of stockholders following the grant date, assuming
continued Board service through each vesting date. Continuing Board members
receive either (1) an option grant (with the number of shares determined
so that the aggregate “fair value” of the option, calculated using the option
pricing model used to estimate the value of compensatory stock options in our
financial statements, would equal the annual cash retainer then paid to non-employee
Board members) or (2) a restricted stock grant (with the number of shares
subject to the award determined so that the fair market value of the restricted
stock grant on the date of grant would equal the annual cash retainer then paid
to non-employee Board members). The option grant or restricted stock
vests in a series of 36 successive equal monthly installments from the grant
date, assuming continued Board membership through each vesting date. The Board
elected to receive restricted stock for the 2006 and future grants and, as a
result, in April 2006 Synopsys issued an aggregate of 5,752 shares of
restricted stock to each non-employee director under the 2005 Directors Plan.
The 2005 Directors Plan expires in May 2007.

Change of Control Agreements and Named Executive
Officer Employment Contracts

2006 Employee
Equity Incentive Plan

Under our

the 2006 Plan, if we
are acquired or in the event of a change in control, including an acquisition
of Synopsys by merger or asset sale, each outstanding option and award under
the 2006 Plan will automatically become exercisable in full, unless the option
is assumed by the successor corporation, or parent thereof, or replaced by a
comparable option or award for shares of the capital stock of the successor
corporation or parent thereof.


1992 Stock Option Plan

Under our 1992 Stock
Option Plan (the 1992 Plan), if we are acquired or in the event of a change in
control, including an acquisition of Synopsys by merger or asset sale, each
outstanding option under the 1992 Plan will automatically become exercisable in
full, unless the option is assumed by the successor corporation, or parent
thereof, or replaced by a comparable option to purchase shares of the capital
stock of the successor corporation or parent thereof. In addition, in the event
of a successful hostile tender offer for more than 50% of our outstanding
shares of common stock or a change in the majority of our Board as a result of
a contested election for membership on our Board, the administrator of the 1992
Plan has the authority to accelerate vesting of outstanding options or shares
purchased under the 1992 Plan.

2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan

Our non-employee directors
receive equity awards under our the 2005 Directors Plan. In the event of a
corporate transaction, as such term is defined in the 2005 Directors Plan, each
outstanding stock option and restricted stock award will automatically
accelerate in full unless the stock option or our reacquisition rights with
respect to the restricted stock award are assumed by or assigned to the
successor corporation or its parent corporation. In the event of a change in
control, as such term is defined in the 2005 Directors Plan, each stock award
under the 2005 Directors Plan will automatically vest as to all shares subject
to the stock award immediately prior to the effective date of the change in
control.

1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan

Our 1994 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan (the 1994 Directors Plan) was the predecessor to
the 2005 Directors Plan. The 1994 Directors Plan expired in October 2004.
An aggregate of 1,277,660 options remain outstanding under such plan and are
held by non-employee directors. Under the 1994 Directors Plan, in the event of
a change of control or corporate transaction, as such terms are defined in the
plan, all outstanding options become fully vested and exercisable as of the
date of such change of control or corporate transaction.

Employment Agreements

We entered into employment agreements, effective October 1,
1997 and amended in March 2006, with our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and our President and Chief Operating Officer. Each employment
agreement provides that if such officer is terminated involuntarily other than
for cause within 24 months of a change of control, (a) such officer
will be paid an amount equal to two times the sum of such officer’s annual base
pay plus his target cash bonus and the cash value such officer’s health
benefits for an 18-month period, and (b) all stock options held by
such officer will immediately vest in full. If the officer is terminated
involuntarily other than for cause in any other situation, the officer will
receive a cash payment equal to the sum of the officer’s annual base pay for
one year plus his target cash bonus for such year and cash value of such
officer’s health benefits for 12 months. The terms “involuntary
termination,” “cause” and “change of control” are defined in the employment
agreements, which have been filed with the SEC.

Executive Change of
Control Severance Benefit Plan.

In March 2006, Synopsys
approved an Executive Change of Control Severance Benefit Plan (the Change of
Control Plan) in order to provide certain benefits to executive officers of
Synopsys in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following a change
of control transaction involving Synopsys. The Change of Control Plan provides
that in the event a covered executive is involuntarily or constructively
terminated within 12 months after a change of control of Synopsys, the
executive shall receive: (1) a cash severance payment equal to one year of
base salary plus one to two times the executive’s target annual bonus depending
upon the timing of the termination within Synopsys’ fiscal year; (2) a
cash payment equal to the cost of health care premiums for one year; and


(3) full
acceleration of all unvested stock options and other stock awards held by the
executive at the time of termination. Executives shall be subject to an 18
month non-competition agreement and must sign a release in order to receive benefits
should a qualifying termination occur. The Change of Control Plan does not
provide for any severance benefits unless the executive’s termination occurs
following a change of control of Synopsys. Similarly, the Change of Control
Plan does not provide any benefits if the termination is for cause.

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

During fiscal 2006, the
Compensation Committee consisted of Mr. Chizen (Chair) and Mr. Walske.
Neither member is an officer or employee of Synopsys, and none of our executive
officers serve as a member of a compensation committee of any entity that has
one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Compensation
Committee. Each of our directors has acquired and holds Synopsys securities.

in the table above have sole voting and investment power with respect to all
shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them as of December 31,

SEC rules. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person or
group and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock
issuable pursuant to options held by that person that are currently exercisable
or exercisable by that person or group within 60 days of December 31,
2006 are deemed to be beneficially owned. Such shares, however, are not deemed
outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other
person.

Item 13.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director
Independence

During fiscal 2006, former director A. Richard Newton
provided advice to us, at our request, concerning long-term technology strategy
and industry development issues, as well as assistance in identifying
opportunities for partnerships with academia. Dr. Newton was a Professor of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Dean of the College of Engineering
at the University of California, Berkeley. In September 2006, we amended
our agreement with Dr. Newton to reduce his annual compensation from
$180,000 per year to $100,000 per year. Dr. Newton passed away in January 2007.

We have entered into
indemnification agreements with our executive officers and directors for the
indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, these persons to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. We also intend to execute these
agreements with our future directors and executive officers. Please see Part II,
Item 11.

accounting for less than five percent of the total fees paid to its principal
accountants which are subsequently ratified by the Audit Committee (the De

Chairperson of the Audit Committee may pre-approve such services provided the
Chairperson report the details of the services to the full Audit Committee at
its next regularly scheduled meeting. None of the non-audit services performed
by KPMG during fiscal 2006 were performed pursuant to the De Minimus Exception
during fiscal 2006 or 2005.
