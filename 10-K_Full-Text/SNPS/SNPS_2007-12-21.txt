contents of our website are not part of this Form 10-K.


The Role of EDA in the Electronics Industry

Technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density, speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors
(also referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips).

•

Since
the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires imprinted on the chips that form the transistors) and other developments have enabled IC
manufacturers to follow "Moore's law," approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip.

•

Chips
have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, music players and personal
digital assistants.

•

Increasingly,
single SoCs can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board.

Combined,
these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lower cost, higher performance computers, wireless communications networks, hand held devices,
internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and manufacturers to
equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as Synopsys.

These
technological challenges have been accompanied by unprecedented business challenges stemming from the semiconductor downturn in 2000-2002, increased globalization
leading customers to source their products in lower cost areas, and consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products.

The IC Design Process

EDA software enables designers to create complex semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps described below.

System Design.

In system design, the designer describes the chip's desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized
high-level computer language, typically C

++

or System C. This phase yields a relatively high level behavioral model of the chip.

Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design.

RTL design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the
system level using a specialized high level computer language, typically Verilog or VHDL.

Logic Design.

Logic design, or "synthesis," programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a
data file known as a netlist describing the various groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip.

Functional Verification.

At the RTL level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools such as RTL
simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended. The increasing size and complexity of today's ICs and SoCs have vastly increased
the time and effort required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to 70% of total design time. As a result, designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing
complexity at ever higher speeds, and that can reduce verification risk (i.e., find design bugs before designs are taken into production).

Physical Design.

In the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of
the wires connecting them with "place and route" products. The designer first


determines
the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each block, a process known as "placement." In many designs, placement is
performed in conjunction with logic synthesis, a process known as "physical synthesis." After placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as "routing." With
increasing gate counts and design complexity, seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important.

Physical Verification.

Before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a
series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip.

Design for Manufacturing.

The design is then translated to a series of photomasks, or physical representations of the design.
IC manufacturers use photomasks to produce the silicon wafer containing individual ICs. As IC wire or "feature" sizes shrink, this translation is becoming more and more difficult. These challenges are
exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process, requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as
optical proximity correction to alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced. Technology computer-aided design, or TCAD, tools are also used to model individual features or
"devices" within the design to help ensure manufacturability. Finally, various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ICs contained on
each silicon wafer.

Intellectual Property Reuse.

As IC designs continue to grow in size and complexity, designers have found that inserting
pre-designed and pre-verified design blocks into the design
can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified. Usually, such IP blocks represent
functions that can be used in multiple applications and ICs, including microprocessors, digital signal processors, or connectivity IP that support such protocols as USB, PCI Express or Ethernet.

Strategy

With increasing chip complexity, designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above sequentially, and must repeat some
steps, such as verification, multiple times before finishing the design. Each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet
time-to-market goals. Synopsys addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms, enabling significantly improved correlation and
interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next.

In
addition, smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before. Synopsys has invested
heavily in design for manufacturing tools and technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield.

Also,
many hardware products contain increasingly complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is designed. We offer system-level products that permit
designers to develop such software earlier in the IC design process, speeding overall development time.

Finally,
designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition. We address this
issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality, pre-verified standards-based and other IP, which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence.


Products and Services

Our products and services are managed by our six principal business groups: the Implementation, Verification, Silicon Engineering, Analog/Mixed-Signal, Systems
and IP and Global Technical Services groups. Our products are divided into five common groupings, or platforms: Galaxy™
Design Platform and Discovery™ Verification Platform (which are typically sold together as Core EDA), Intellectual Property, Design for Manufacturing and Professional Services.

Galaxy Design Platform

Our Galaxy Design platform provides our customers with a single, integrated IC design solution which includes industry-leading individual products and which
incorporates common libraries and consistent timing, delay calculation and constraints throughout the design process. The platform uses our open Milkyway database and allows designers the flexibility
to integrate internally developed and third-party tools. With this advanced functionality, common foundation and flexibility, our Galaxy Design platform helps reduce design times, decrease integration
costs and minimize the risks inherent in advanced, complex IC designs.

The
Galaxy Design Platform includes:

•

typically provide our customers limited indemnities with respect to claims that their use of our design and verification software products infringe on United States patents, copyrights, trademarks or
trade secrets. We have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date, although we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products
infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics company.

Support for Industry Standards

We actively create and support standards that help our customers increase productivity, facilitate efficient design flows, improve interoperability of tools from
different vendors, and ensure connectivity, functionality and interoperability of IP building blocks. Standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations,
from industry consortia, by company licensing made available to all, from de facto usage, or through open source licensing.

Synopsys'
products support over 60 standards, including the most commonly used hardware description languages: SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL, and SystemC. Our products utilize numerous
industry standard data formats, application programming interfaces, and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools, other EDA vendor's products, and applications that customers develop
internally. We also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our IP product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity.


Sales, Distribution and Backlog

We market our products and services primarily through direct sales in the United States and principal foreign markets. We typically distribute our products and
documentation to customers electronically, but provide physical media (i.e. CD-ROMs) when requested by the customer.

We
maintain sales/support centers throughout the United States. Outside the United States we maintain sales/support offices in Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Our foreign headquarters
is located in Dublin, Ireland. Our offices are further described under Part I, Item 2.

Properties

.

In
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, an aggregate of 50%, 49% and 49%, respectively, of Synopsys' total revenue was derived from sales outside of the United States. Additional information
relating to domestic and foreign operations, including revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, is contained in Note 11 of

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

in Part II, Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

and is incorporated by reference
here. Information relating to risks associated with foreign operations is described in Part I, Item 1A.

Risk Factors—Conditions of foreign economies, foreign
exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance

and

Unfavorable tax law changes,
an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results

and is
incorporated by reference here.

Synopsys'
aggregate backlog was approximately $2.5 billion on October 31, 2007, representing a 25% increase from backlog of $2.0 billion on October 31, 2006.
This increase is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average length of our contracts caused by the extended length of a large customer agreement, as well as an increase in the number and size
of orders received during fiscal 2007. Aggregate backlog includes deferred revenue, operational backlog and financial backlog. Deferred revenue represents that portion of orders for software products,
license maintenance and other services which have been delivered and billed to the customer but on which the revenue has not yet been recognized. Operational backlog consists of orders for software
products and maintenance that have not been shipped and orders for consulting services that have not yet been performed and accepted. Financial backlog consists of future installments not yet due and
payable under existing time-based licenses and maintenance contracts. Backlog, particularly longer-term backlog, may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business
conditions change and technologies evolve, and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements. For this and other reasons, we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when
expected. We have not historically experienced material order cancellations.

The
following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our five common groupings, or platforms, established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue for the
last three fiscal years. We include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods. For presentation
purposes, we allocate maintenance revenue, which represented approximately 6%, 9% and 14% of our total


revenue
in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to the products to which those support services related.

derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 11%, 11% and 13% of our total revenue for the fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Research and Development

Our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms and to expand our design for manufacturing
and IP product offerings. Research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group. In addition, an Advanced Technology Group within Synopsys' Silicon
Engineering Group explores new technologies and maintains strong research relationships outside Synopsys with both industry and academia.

During
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, research and development expenses, excluding capitalized software development costs, were $379.2 million, $370.6 million and
$320.9 million, respectively. Synopsys' capitalized software development costs were approximately $2.3 million, $3.5 million, and $3.0 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

Competition

The EDA industry is highly competitive. We compete against other EDA vendors and against our customers' own design tools and internal design capabilities. In
general, we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), time-to-results, post-sale
support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and payment terms.

Our
competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services, such as Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation, and companies that offer
products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process, such as Magma Design Automation, Inc. In recent years, we have increasingly competed on the basis of payment terms and
price. In some situations, in order to win business we must offer substantial discounts on our products due to competitive factors. In other situations, we may lose potential business to a competitor
offering a lower price.

Product Sales and Licensing Agreements

We typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our
software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. The majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined
network, including, in some cases, regional or
global networks. License fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed.

In
many cases, we provide our customers the right to "re-mix" a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified Synopsys products. For example, a customer
may use our front-end


design
products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for back-end placement software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer's IC
design. This practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. The customer's re-mix of product, when so provided under the customer
agreement, does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer, which is governed by our revenue recognition policies. The ability to offer this right to customers often
gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products, because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor. At the same time, because in such cases the
customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the
individual products separately without re-mix rights.

We
currently offer our software products under various license types: renewable TSLs, term licenses and perpetual licenses. For a full discussion of these licenses, see Part II,
Item 7.

Revenue Background

.

With
respect to our DesignWare Core intellectual property products, we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights
for specific applications. Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases, royalties.

Finally,
our Global Technical Services team providing design consulting services typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each
project.

Proprietary Rights

Synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and
protect its proprietary rights. Our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work. However, third parties may
develop similar technology independently. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. We currently hold United States and
foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future.

In
many cases, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party's intellectual property
rights. As a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. For example, we are currently defending some of our customers against claims
that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it.

Employees

As of October 31, 2007, Synopsys had 5,196 employees, with 2,781 based in North America and 2,415 based outside of North America.

Acquisitions in Fiscal 2007

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Weakness, budgetary caution or consolidation in the semiconductor and electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our
business.

In
recent years, we believe that EDA industry growth has been adversely affected by many factors, including ongoing efforts by semiconductor companies to control their spending,
uncertainty regarding the long-term growth rate of the semiconductor industry, excess EDA tool capacity of some of our customers and increased competition in the EDA industry itself
causing pricing pressure on EDA vendors. If these factors persist or additional semiconductor industry growth does not occur (or if we do not benefit from any such increases), our business, operating
results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

We
also believe that, over the long term, growth in EDA spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor R&D spending and continued growth in the overall semiconductor market.
However, we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues, R&D spending or spending on EDA products, nor whether we will benefit from any of these increases should they
occur.

Competition in the EDA industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

We
compete with other EDA vendors that offer a broad range of products and services, primarily Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation and with other EDA
vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process, such as Magma Design Automation, Inc. We also compete with customers' internally developed design
tools and capabilities. If we fail to compete effectively, our business will be materially and adversely affected. We compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features
(including ease-of-use), time-to-results, post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and payment terms.

Additional
competitive challenges include the following:

•

Price continues to be a competitive factor

.    We believe that some EDA vendors are increasingly offering
discounts, which could be significant. If we are unable to match a competitor's pricing for a particular solution, we may lose business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations, particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other EDA purchases with the competitor.

•

Technology in the EDA industry evolves rapidly

.    Accordingly, we must correctly anticipate and lead critical
developments, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products. If we fail to do so, our business will be materially and adversely
affected.

•

To compete effectively, we believe we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high
level of individual product performance.

We have invested significant resources into further development of our Galaxy Design Platform, integration of our
Discovery Verification Platform and enhancement of its SystemVerilog and other advanced features and development of our Design for Manufacturing and IP portfolios. We can provide no assurance that our
customers will find these tool and IP configurations more attractive than our competitors' offerings or that our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance
will be successful.

•

Payment terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated by our customers

.    Payment
terms on time-based licenses have generally lengthened over time. Longer payment terms could continue in the future, which would negatively affect our future operating cash flow.


•

Potential consolidation of competitors.

If any of our competitors consolidate, they may be able to exert
additional market power and/or offer lower pricing, either of which would make it more difficult to compete successfully.

Lack of growth in new IC design starts, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may adversely affect the EDA industry, including
demand for our products and services.

The
increasing complexities of SoCs and ICs, and customers' concerns about managing cost and risk have also led to the following potentially long-term negative trends:

•

The
number of IC design starts has remained flat during the last three years. New IC design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for EDA software.

•

A
number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely. Mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of EDA software
and services, and in some cases, increase customers' bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including Synopsys.

•

Due
to factors such as increased globalization, cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent, adversely impacting our customers' EDA spending.

•

Industry
changes, plus the cost and complexity of IC design, may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general, to focus only on
one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design, or using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), an alternative chip technology.

All
of these trends, if sustained, could have a material adverse effect on the EDA industry, including the demand for our products and services, which in turn would materially and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our prior financial
statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various
bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles, or in our interpretations of these principles, can have a significant effect on our reported
results and may retroactively affect previously reported results.

For
example, in September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

(SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying misstatements and provides
interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. In the year of adoption,
SAB 108 allows a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment for errors that were not previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance in SAB 108. We adopted the
provisions of SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and as a result recognized a one-time adjustment of approximately $14.9 million to retained earnings.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

(FIN 48). FIN 48 addresses recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 will be effective for Synopsys beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year
2008. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we are required to make an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the impact of adoption as well as adjust certain balance sheet amounts to conform with the new
standard. While we are in the process of completing our review of FIN 48, we do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our retained earnings or our results of operations for
fiscal year 2008. However, certain reclassifications to our assets and liabilities may be required.


We have received a Revenue Agent's Report from the Internal Revenue Service claiming a significant increase in our U.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome could
have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

On
June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR") in which the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001
of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. This proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. We strongly
believe the proposed IRS adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that we thus have meritorious defenses to this proposed IRS adjustment. On
July 13, 2005, we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the matter to be referred to the Appeals Division of the IRS. In December 2007, we reached a
tentative settlement with the Appeals Division that would resolve this dispute. The settlement is subject to further review and approval within the government, which we expect will take several more
months, but we believe that settlement is likely. If the settlement becomes final on the tentative terms agreed upon, then we have already adequately provided for this matter. Final resolution of this
matter could take considerable time or may not be finally approved by the government, in which case, while we believe we are still adequately provided for regarding this matter, there is still a
possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income
could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results.

Our
operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. A change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do
business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense.

Our
tax filings are subject to review or audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We exercise judgment in determining our worldwide
provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In the third quarter of fiscal
year 2006, the IRS started an examination of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years 2002 through 2004. As of October 31, 2007, the examination is still in progress and no
adjustments have been proposed by the IRS which would require an adjustment to the tax provision. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final
determination in the audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit,
there could be a material adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

We
have large operations both in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. Certain foreign operations are subject to temporary
favorable foreign tax rates. Therefore, any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions and expiration of foreign tax rulings could materially increase our effective tax rate.
Furthermore, we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the United
States. Changes in our forecasts of such future foreign source income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our
financial results.

Our revenue and earnings fluctuate, which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock price to decline.

Many
factors affect our revenue and earnings, including customer demand, license mix, the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold and committed expense levels, making
it difficult


to
predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period. Accordingly, stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance.

From
time to time, we provide guidance related to our future financial performance. In addition, financial analysts publish their own expectations of our future financial performance.
Because our quarterly revenue and our operating results fluctuate, future financial performance is difficult to predict. Downward adjustments of our guidance or the failure to meet our guidance or the
expectations of research analysts would cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

Some
of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include, but are not limited to:

•

We
base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized. Since only
a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income.

•

Our
revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time-based licenses. The
amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders, customer demand, customer payment terms and ship dates could have a material adverse effect
on our revenue and earnings. For example, if we ship more upfront licenses than expected during any given fiscal period, our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if
orders are below target; conversely, if we ship fewer upfront licenses than expected, our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our
target. Similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of time-based license orders during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be negatively
affected.

•

We
may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externally-communicated financial targets, any of which could fail to result in the
anticipated cost savings or could adversely affect our business.

•

The
market for EDA products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers' products, customer R&D and EDA tool budgets, pricing,
our competitors' product offerings and customer design starts. It is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on our customers' demand for our products on a medium or long
term basis. As a result, actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which, in turn, could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly-
disclosed targets.

•

We
often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new products. Although these amendments can provide a longer-term payment stream from
the customers, they can also result in a lower amount of revenue being recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value of the extended contract is larger.

•

Certain
of our upfront and time-based license agreements provide customers the right to re-mix a portion of the software initially subject to the
license for other specified Synopsys products. While this practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of these arrangements could
result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately.

•

In
the past, we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. The delay of one or more
orders, particularly an upfront order, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and/or earnings for that quarter.


•

We
rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenue and the loss of one of such customers could have an adverse effect on our subsequent revenue and/or
earnings;

•

We
make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition, specifically determining the existence of proper documentation, establishing that the fee is fixed or
determinable, verifying delivery of our software and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers. While we believe our judgments in these areas are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such
judgments will not be challenged in the future. In such an event, we could be required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods, which would have an adverse impact on our
reported results of operations for those periods.

•

Our
customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision. Accordingly, our
customers' evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters. Further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approvals or starts because of
budgetary constraints or their budget cycles.

The failure to meet the semiconductor industry's demands for advancing EDA technology and continued cost reductions may adversely affect our financial
results.

SoC
and IC functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of IC design and manufacturing. To address greater
complexity, semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from EDA suppliers. At the same time, as a general business trend, we believe some customers and potential customers
are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk. In order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our
customers' technology requirements, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs.
Failure to manage these conflicting demands successfully would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Customer payment defaults or related issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
backlog consists principally of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. These customer obligations are typically not
cancelable, but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults or declares bankruptcy and fails to pay amounts owed. In these cases, we will generally take legal action to
recover amounts owed. Moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses. Though we have not, to date,
experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project.

We
have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions
in the future.

In
addition to direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including:

•

Potential
negative impact on our earnings per share;

•

Failure
of acquired products to achieve projected sales;

•

Problems
in integrating the acquired products with our products;

•

Difficulties
in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company;

•

Failure
to realize expected synergies or cost savings;


•

Regulatory
delays;

•

Drain
on management time for acquisition-related activities;

•

Assumption
of unknown liabilities; and

•

Adverse
effects on customer buying patterns or relationships.

While
we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us, we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will positively affect our future
performance. Furthermore, if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we could be required to write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the
product or technology; any such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Conditions of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our
performance.

During
fiscal 2007 and 2006, we derived 50% and 49% of our revenue from outside the United States; going forward, we expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend
on substantial contributions from customers outside the United States. Foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions, including the effects of
international political conflict, hostilities and natural disasters. Further, any deterioration of foreign economies or foreign currency exchange rates would adversely affect our performance by
reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the United States.

Our
operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations can be adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens relative to
other currencies,
including the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar, as a result of the conversion of revenue and expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar.
Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. While we hedge some foreign currency exposures of our business, we are unable to hedge all of our currency exposures, and there can be no assurance our hedging activities will
completely mitigate our foreign currency risks.

In
addition, we have expanded our non-U.S. operations significantly in the past several years. While the increased international presence of our business creates the
potential for cost reductions locally and higher international sales, this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote
locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the United States. The failure to effectively manage our global operations would have
a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

From time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights.

Under
our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe on a third party's intellectual property rights. As
a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. For example, in March 2007, we settled a matter with Magma Design, Inc. in
which both parties claimed patent infringement. As part of the settlement, Magma paid us an aggregate of $12.5 million. We are also currently defending some of our customers against claims that
their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it.


These
types of claims can, however, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions
restricting our sale of products, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

A failure to protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Our
success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. To protect this technology, we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual
property laws worldwide. We can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become
known or be independently developed by competitors. Moreover, some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property; our ability to prevent the
unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. We have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our
products and technologies. For example, we are pursuing anti-piracy cases against certain companies located in China. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be
successful. If we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our
business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees
related to such litigation may reduce our net income.

Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance, which
could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

We
are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the SEC, Nasdaq and the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. Many of these regulations continue to evolve, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are
likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

In
particular, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and
auditor attestation of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports. This effort has required, and will continue to require in the future, the commitment of significant
financial and managerial resources. Any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an unqualified opinion from our auditors could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.

A failure to timely recruit and retain key employees would have a material adverse effect on our business.

To
be successful, we must attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join Synopsys in connection with acquisitions. There are a limited number
of qualified EDA and IC design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. Our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. In addition, a
reorganization of our operations to better address customer needs, improve operational efficiency or reduce expenses may lead to the loss of key employees. Any failure to recruit and retain key
technical, sales and managerial employees would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.


We
issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. There is growing pressure on public companies
from stockholders, who must approve any increases in our equity pool, generally to reduce our overhang or amount of outstanding and unexercised stock options. In addition, recent accounting rules that
require us to recognize on our income statement compensation expense from employee equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan have increased pressure to limit equity grants. These factors may
make it more difficult for Synopsys to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.

Product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation.

Despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new
versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. Product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development
or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. In addition, allegations of IC manufacturability issues resulting
from use of our IP products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license IP products from us. Any such errors or delays in releasing new products or
new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from
other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.

We rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales
activities. A disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause
system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our
research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in California, near major earthquake faults. We believe we have developed sufficient
disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or
our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely
affected.

Properties

United States Facilities

Our principal offices are located in four adjacent buildings in Mountain View, California, which together provide approximately 400,000 square feet of available
space. This space is leased through February 2015. We occupy approximately 200,000 square feet of space in two adjacent buildings in Sunnyvale, California under lease through
October 2012, and approximately 72,000 square feet of space in a third building in Sunnyvale under lease through April 2012. We use these buildings for administrative, marketing,
research and development, sales and support activities. In addition, we lease approximately 80,000 square feet of space in Marlboro, Massachusetts for sales and support, research


and
development and customer education activities. This facility is leased through January 2009. We currently lease 20 other offices throughout the United States, primarily for sales and
support activities.

We
own two buildings totaling approximately 230,000 square feet on approximately 43 acres of land in Hillsboro, Oregon, one of which is currently vacant. The other is used for
administrative, marketing, research and development and support activities.

We
own a third building in Sunnyvale, California with approximately 120,000 square feet, which is leased to a third party through April 2009. We also own 13 acres of undeveloped
land in Marlboro, Massachusetts.

International Facilities

We lease approximately 45,000 square feet in Dublin, Ireland for our foreign headquarters and for research and development purposes. In addition, we lease foreign
sales and service offices in Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan
and the United Kingdom. We also lease research and development facilities in Armenia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the People's Republic of China, Russia, South Korea,
Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

As
a result of acquisitions, we have assumed leases in a number of foreign and domestic locations. Following each acquisition, where feasible, we consolidate the acquired company's
employees and operations into our existing local sites. In such cases, we generally seek to sublease the assumed space or negotiate with the landlord to terminate the underlying lease.

We
believe our properties are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs.

Legal Proceedings

IRS Revenue Agent's Report

On June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR") in which the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for
fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. This proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly-owned
foreign subsidiary. We strongly believe the proposed IRS adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that we thus have meritorious defenses to this
proposed IRS adjustment.

On
July 13, 2005, we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the matter to be referred to the Appeals Division of the IRS. In December 2007,
we reached a tentative settlement with the Appeals Division that would resolve this dispute. The settlement is subject to further review and approval within the government, which we expect will take
several more months, but we believe that settlement is likely. If the settlement becomes final on the tentative terms agreed upon, then we have already adequately provided for this matter. Final
resolution of this matter could take considerable time or may not be finally approved by the government, in which case, while we believe we are still adequately provided for regarding this matter,
there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Other Proceedings

We are also subject to other routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business. The
ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and


financial
condition. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Synopsys because of the defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion
contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part 1 of this Report regarding forward-
looking statements.

Business Environment

We generate substantially all of our revenue from customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries. Our customers typically fund purchases of our
software and services largely out of their research and development (R&D) budgets and, to a lesser extent, their manufacturing and capital budgets. As a result, our customers' business outlook and
willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs heavily influence our business.

Since
the 2000 through 2002 semiconductor downturn and subsequent recovery, our customers have focused significantly on expense reductions, including in their R&D budgets. This expense
outlook has affected us in a number of ways. First, some customers have reduced their EDA expenditures by decreasing their level of EDA tool purchases, using older generations of EDA products or by
not renewing maintenance services. Second, customers bargain more intensely on pricing and payment terms, which has affected revenues industry-wide. For example, customers' desire to
conserve cash by paying for licenses over time resulted in us shifting our business model in the fourth quarter of 2004 to a model in which a substantial portion of our software license revenue in any
particular period results from revenue recognized over time rather than upfront at the time of shipment. This shift adversely affected our total revenue in fiscal 2005 and 2006. Third, some customers
are consolidating their EDA purchases with fewer suppliers in order to lower their overall cost of
ownership while at the same time meeting new technology challenges. This has increased competition among EDA vendors.

Recognizing
that our customers will continue to spend cautiously and will work to aggressively contain costs, we are intensely focused on improving our customers' overall economics of
design by providing more fully integrated design solutions and offering customers the opportunity to consolidate their EDA spending with us. Over the long term, we believe EDA industry spending growth
will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor R&D spending and on continued growth in the overall semiconductor market.

Fiscal 2007 Financial Performance Summary

•

Total
revenue was $1,212.5 million, up 11% from $1,095.6 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily attributable to increased bookings of TSLs in prior
periods which increase time-based revenue recognized in later periods, reflecting the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

•

Time-based
license revenue of $1,004.0 million, up 15% from $874.9 million in fiscal 2006, is attributable to increased bookings of TSLs in prior
periods which increase time-based revenue recognized in later periods, reflecting the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

•

Upfront
license revenue of $67.5 million, up 7% from $63.1 million in fiscal 2006, reflects fluctuations in customer license type requirements for licenses
generating upfront revenue.

•

We
derived approximately 94% of our software license revenue from license arrangements generating time-based revenues, maintenance and services, and 6% from
licenses generating


upfront
revenue in fiscal 2007, versus approximately 93% and 7%, respectively, in fiscal 2006. This reflects our adherence to our business model.

•

Maintenance
revenue was $72.2 million, down 30% from $103.1 million in fiscal 2006. This decrease in maintenance revenue is primarily attributable to the
business model shift and the transition to more TSLs for which maintenance is bundled and not charged separately. The decline is also attributable, to a lesser extent, by the non-renewal
of maintenance by some of our existing perpetual license customers. Professional service and other revenue of $68.7 million up 26% from $54.5 million in fiscal 2006, increased primarily
due to the timing and acceptance of performed milestones under existing service contracts.

•

Net
income was $130.5 million compared to $24.7 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in net income is primarily due to increased bookings of TSLs in prior
periods, which increased revenue in the current period, as well as cost control efforts.

•

We
repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $26.54 per share for a total of approximately $151.6 million.

•

Net
cash provided by operations increased 111% to $433.5 million in fiscal 2007 from $205.9 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is attributable mainly to
higher net income, increased collections as a result of payments received from a significant customer, a litigation settlement of $12.5 million received from Magma Design Automation (Magma),
decreased commission payments, and timing of payments to vendors.

Fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 Acquisitions

We have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years, and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to make
additional acquisitions in the future. Below is a list of our principal acquisitions during the last three fiscal years. See Note 3 of

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading "Result of Operations" below are based on our audited consolidated financial statements,
which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and net income. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions
we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2

of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

.


The
accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:

•

Revenue
recognition;

•

Valuation
of share-based compensation;

•

Valuation
of intangible assets; and

•

Income
taxes

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and service revenue. Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing
of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees.

We
have designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," as amended.

With
respect to software licenses, we utilize three license types:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

, are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the
customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We bundle and do not charge separately for post-contract
customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license.

•

Term Licenses,

are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed
software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically
calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

•

Perpetual Licenses,

continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual
licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may
renew annually.

For
the three software license types, we recognize revenue as follows:

•

TSLs.

We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of
the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as "time-based revenue" in the statement of operations.

•

Term Licenses.

We recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms
require the customer to pay at least 75% of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these term licenses is
reported as "upfront license revenue" in the statement of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as
customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as "time-based revenue" in the statement of operations.

•

Perpetual Licenses.

We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if
payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these
perpetual licenses is reported as "upfront revenue" in the statement of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee is payable within


one
year from shipment, we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as "time-based revenue" in
the statement of operations.

In
addition, we recognize revenue from maintenance fees associated with term and perpetual licenses ratably over the maintenance period and recognize revenue from professional service
and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as "service revenue" in the statement
of operations.

Our
determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element
to the price charged when such element is sold separately.

We
have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance
components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual
and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and we recognize revenue from professional services as the related
services are performed and accepted. We recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to
allocate the TSL fee between license and maintenance services.

We
make significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectibility of
the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition
criteria as follows.

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.

Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary
policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or
purchase agreement.

•

Delivery Has Occurred.

We deliver software to our customers physically or electronically. For physical
deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes, or "license keys," that allow the
customer to take immediate possession of the software by downloading it to the customer's hardware. We generally ship our software products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer
orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational
capacity to fulfill software license orders at the end of a quarter.

•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable.

Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends
principally on the arrangement's payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement
includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are
met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the
case of a TSL, we recognize


revenue
ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable, due to the fact that VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL and due to revenue recognition criteria relating to arrangements
that include rights to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology.

•

Collectibility is Probable.

We judge collectibility of the arrangement fees on a
customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or
when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to us, we evaluate the customer's financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We
increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable under a particular
arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer's payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.

Valuation of Share-Based Compensation.

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)). Under SFAS
No. 123(R), stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including
expected volatility, expected term and the risk-free interest rates. We estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock
with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our share-based awards. We determine the expected term of our share-based awards based
on historical experience. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the forfeiture rate on share-based awards. We calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends.
These input factors are subjective and are determined using management's judgment. If a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining share-based compensation cost and the actual
factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future share-based compensation costs. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in
the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter.

Valuation of Intangible Assets.

We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer-installed base/relationships, trademarks
and trade names, covenants not to compete, customer backlog, capitalized software and other intangibles. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative
to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative
industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset
over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining
amortization period, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period. Any such impairment charge could be significant
and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2007. As of October 31, 2007, the
carrying amount of our intangible assets, net was $78.8 million.

Income Taxes.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109). Our estimates and assumptions used in such


provisions
may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified and resolved.

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which we expect the differences to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to
utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and
our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the
forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of
$337.7 million that are recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a
portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.

Included
in our net deferred tax assets are federal foreign tax credits of $65.5 million of which $60.3 million will expire from fiscal 2013 through 2017 and the remaining
$5.2 million in foreign tax credits from acquired companies, which have a valuation allowance of $2.4 million, will expire between fiscal 2008 and 2011. Foreign tax credits can only be
carried forward ten years, unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon
having sufficient foreign source income during the
carryforward period. Our ability to maintain the deferred tax credit requires significant judgment in forecasting our future foreign source income.

We
have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the United States. If the cumulative
foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future, we would provide for taxes on such excess amount. As of October 31, 2007, there was approximately
$127.6 million of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided.

In
addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws. We are also subject to examination by various
taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we would
reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax
liabilities, we would record an additional charge to earnings. See

fiscal years 2000 and 2001.

Results of Operations

Revenue Background

We generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses, maintenance and professional services. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize
revenue from orders we receive for software licenses and services at varying times. In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order quarterly over the license term and on a
term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is shipped. Substantially all of our current time-based licenses are TSLs with an average license term of
approximately three years. Maintenance orders normally bring in


revenue
ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year). Professional service orders generally turns into revenue upon completion and customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones. A
more complete description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

.

Our
revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time-based license, upfront license, maintenance and professional service revenue for the period. We derive
time-based license revenue in any quarter almost entirely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters. We derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual
license orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter. We derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders
generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional service revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional
services when those services are delivered and accepted, not when they are booked.

Our
license revenue is very sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue
but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but
$10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters. Conversely, perpetual licenses and term licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate
current quarter revenue but no future revenue (e.g., a $120,000 order for a perpetual license generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped, but no future revenue).

The
increase in total revenue for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to (1) increased bookings of licenses generating time-based revenue reflecting
the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the transition to more TSLs in prior periods that continue to contribute to time-based license revenue in later periods,
and (2) the fact that fiscal 2007 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2006, resulting in one week's additional time-based revenue being recognized in fiscal 2007. The
increase was partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and service revenue. In future periods when each of the comparative periods refects full maturity of our business model shift to a model with
substantially more time-based revenue, we expect that the model change itself will no longer contribute to the increases in total revenue or time-based revenue.

The
increase in total revenue for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to an increase in time-based license revenue from orders booked in prior periods which
more than offset a decrease in maintenance and service revenue during the fiscal 2006.

The increase in time-based revenue for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to (1) increased bookings of TSLs in prior periods which increased

The
increase in time-based license revenue in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, primarily reflects the continuation of our highly time-based revenue model,
under which previously booked orders continue to contribute to revenue in later periods, combined with increased business levels in earlier quarters.

Our
maintenance revenue has declined in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to our shift towards TSLs, which bundles maintenance
with the license fee and thus generates no separately recognized maintenance revenue, as well as non-renewal of maintenance by some customers on perpetual or term licenses. Some customers
may choose in the future not to renew maintenance on perpetual or term licenses for economic or other factors, which would also adversely affect future maintenance revenue.

Professional
service and other revenue increased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to timing and acceptance of performance milestones
under existing service contracts.


Events Affecting Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses

Functional Allocation of Operating Expenses.

We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility
expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction,
realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool.

53 Week Fiscal Year.

We
divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of license revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly
associated with providing consulting and training from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions which provide license delivery and post-customer contract support
services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and service revenue reported during the quarter.

Cost of license revenue.

Cost of license revenue includes costs associated with the sale and licensing of our software
products. Additionally, cost of license revenue also includes allocated costs of license delivery, such as employee salaries and benefits related to software delivery, software production costs,
product packaging, amortization of capitalized software development costs, documentation and royalties to third party vendors.

Cost of maintenance and service revenue.

Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes employee salary and benefits for
consulting professionals and associated costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization. Further, cost of maintenance and service revenue also includes
allocated costs which provide post customer contract services such as employee salary and benefits related to customer services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services
and documentation of maintenance updates.

Amortization of intangible assets.

See

Amortization of Intangible Assets

below for information regarding the amount of amortization charged to cost of revenue for the relevant periods.

The
increase in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to (1) an increase of $12.6 million in compensation and employee benefits due
to our increased personnel costs and as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and in late fiscal 2006, (2) an increase of $1.2 million in direct costs as a result of increased
shipments during fiscal 2007, (3) 53 weeks of costs in fiscal 2007 instead of 52 weeks in fiscal 2006, and (4) $1.0 million increase in human resources, information technology and
facilities costs, allocated to this line item. This increase was partially offset by a


decrease
of $5.0 million in amortization of certain intangible assets as a result of intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2007.

The
decrease in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decrease of $53.0 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from
completion of amortization of certain intangible assets primarily acquired in the acquisition of Avant! Corporation in June 2002. This decrease was partially offset by increases of
(1) recognition of $9.2 million in share-based compensation expense due to adoption of SFAS 123(R), (2) $6.1 million in compensation and employee benefits due to our
increased personnel costs and as a result of acquisitions including $1.0 million in compensation to former Integrated Systems Engineering AG employees based on achievement of certain sales and
employee retention milestones, and (3) $5.8 million in corporate allocated expenses including human resources, information technology and facilities costs, allocated to this line item
compared to the same period in fiscal 2005 as a result of increased allocable expenses.

as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and in late fiscal 2006, in addition to an extra week of expense in fiscal 2007. This increase was partially offset by (1) a decrease of
$3.8 million in share-based compensation expense, (2) a decrease of $4.8 million in general operational activities such as expenses for travel, entertainment, communications,
depreciation, and (3) to a lesser extent by reductions in corporate-wide allocable expenses, including human resources, information technology and facilities costs, allocated to
this line item compared to the same period in fiscal 2006.

The
increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to: (1) recognition of $28.0 million in share-based compensation
expense due to adoption of SFAS 123(R), (2) an increase of $12.6 million in research and development personnel-related costs as a result of acquisitions including
$4.5 million in compensation due to former ISE employees now employed by Synopsys based upon achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones, and (3) an increase of
$8.9 million in corporate allocated expenses, including human resources, information technology and facilities costs, allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal 2005 as a
result of increased corporate-wide allocable expenses.

an
extra week of expense in fiscal 2007. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $3.3 million in general operation activities such as travel, entertainment, communications,
depreciation and a $2.8 million reduction in corporate-wide allocable expenses, including human resources, information technology and facilities costs, allocated to this line item
compared to the same period in fiscal 2006.

The
decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to (1) a $10.6 million reduction in variable compensation driven by

efficiencies in our operations and cost control efforts, and (3) a gain of $4.3 million, net of related expenses, for a land sale recorded as an offset to expense under this line. These
decreases were offset by (1) an increase of $2.9 million in expense related to facility operations and (2) a net increase of $2.3 million in corporate allocated expenses,
including human resources, information technology and facilities costs, allocated to this line item.

The
increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to (1) a recognition of $9.5 million in share-based compensation
expense due to adoption of SFAS 123(R), (2) an increase of $3.1 million in facilities costs and property taxes, (3) an increase of $9.7 million in professional
services expenses related to litigation matters, audit services, Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance and tax services, (4) an increase of $3.2 million as a result of reduction in bad debt
reserve taken in fiscal 2005 in excess of those taken in fiscal 2006, and (5) an increase of $2.2 million in telecommunication and networking expenses. These increases were partially
offset by (1) $3.2 million decrease in compensation expense primarily related to reduction in headcount, (2) $2.1 million decrease in travel, employee training and
functions, and other related costs, and (3) $15.4 million decrease in corporate allocated expenses, including human resources, information technology and facilities costs, allocated to
this line item.

In-Process Research and Development

In-process research and development (IPRD) expense is comprised of in-process technologies of $3.2 million associated with the
acquisitions of ArchPro and Sandwork in fiscal 2007, $0.8 million associated with the acquisition of HPL in fiscal 2006 and $5.7 million associated with the acquisition of ISE in fiscal
2005. At the date of each acquisition, the projects associated with the IPRD efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future
uses. Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies.


Valuation of IPRD.

Upon acquisition of other companies, we expense any acquired in-process research and
development (IPRD) as it represents incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The value
assigned to IPRD is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the IPRD into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The utilized discount rate is our weighted-average cost of capital, taking
into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology, the successful development of the IPRD, its useful life and the uncertainty of
technological advances, all of which are unknown at the time of determination.

Sandwork.

On October 1, 2007, we acquired Sandwork Design, Inc. (Sandwork), a company providing tools to
efficiently analyze and debug complex Analog Mixed Signal (AMS) systems-on-chips (SoCs). The IPRD expense related to the Sandwork acquisition was $1.1 million. Sandwork
had two projects in process at the time of acquisition which we anticipate will be completed over a period of approximately two years.

ArchPro.

On June 14, 2007, we acquired ArchPro Design Automation, Inc. (ArchPro), a company with modern power
management verification technologies. The IPRD expense related to the ArchPro acquisition was $2.1 million. ArchPro had several projects in process at the time of acquisition which we
anticipate will be completed over a period of approximately two years.

HPL.

On December 7, 2005, we acquired HPL Technologies, Inc. (HPL), a yield management and test chip technology
company. The IPRD expense related to the HPL acquisition was $0.8 million. HPL had one IPRD project which was completed during fiscal 2006 and the resulting products have begun to generate
revenue. The expenditures to complete HPL's acquired in-process technologies approximated the original estimates.

ISE.

On November 2, 2004, we acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, AG (ISE), a leading provider of TCAD (Technology
Computer Aided Design) software and related services. The IPRD expense related to the ISE acquisition was $5.7 million. ISE had one IPRD project which was completed during fiscal 2005 and the
resulting products have begun to generate revenue. The expenditures to complete ISE's acquired in-process technologies approximated the original estimates.

Amortization of Intangible Assets.

Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the contract rights
associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and other intangibles related
to acquisitions completed in prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:

For
fiscal 2007, the amount included a litigation settlement of $12.5 million received from Magma. For fiscal year 2005, the amount included a $33.0 million litigation
settlement gain relating to the acquisition of Nassda.

In
the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we re-evaluated our interpretation of certain provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging

(SFAS 133), resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior
year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of our hedging program. To correct the error, we reclassified
the remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in fiscal year 2005. See Note 2 and Note 10 of

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Income Taxes

Income Taxes.

The relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect
our effective tax rate. We are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate. As of October 31, 2007, current deferred tax assets, net of current deferred
tax liabilities, totaled $123.2 million. Non-current deferred tax assets, net of non-current deferred tax liabilities, totaled $214.5 million. We believe it is
more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets. We consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance, and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net


deferred
tax assets in the future, we would record a charge to income and an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination.

Included
in our net deferred tax assets are federal foreign tax credits of $65.5 million of which $60.3 million will expire from fiscal 2013 through 2017 and the remaining
$5.2 million in foreign tax credits from acquired companies, which have a valuation allowance of $2.4 million, will expire between fiscal 2008 and 2011. Foreign tax credits can only be
carried forward ten years, unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon
having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period.

We
have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the United States. If the cumulative
foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future, we would provide taxes on such excess amount. As of October 31, 2007, there was approximately
$127.6 million of earnings upon which income taxes have not been provided.

The
2007 tax rate is lower than 2006 primarily due to lower withholding taxes as a result of restructuring of certain of our foreign operations, and increased research credits. The 2007
effective tax rate includes a non-recurring benefit of $2.2 million related to the reenactment of the federal research credit, retroactive to January 1, 2006.

For
fiscal year 2006, the effective tax rate includes state tax expense of $5.5 million for prior year state taxes, primarily as a result of state tax audits settled and a
settlement offer made in fiscal 2006 and associated interest and penalties, as well as a reduction in an estimated fiscal 2005 state research and development credit benefit. We recorded no tax benefit
in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006 for expenses relating to the vesting of qualified stock options and share-based compensation costs which are borne by certain of our foreign
subsidiaries.

For
fiscal year 2005, the effective tax rate includes the impact of $11.6 million tax expense associated with repatriation of approximately $185.0 million of foreign
earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

In
May 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was enacted, which provides a three-year exception to current U.S. taxation of certain foreign
intercompany income. This provision first applied to Synopsys in fiscal year 2007.

In
December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 was enacted, which retroactively extended the research and development credit from January 1, 2006. As a
result, we increased our fiscal 2006 research and development credit by $2.2 million in fiscal 2007.

Tax Effects of Stock Awards.

In November 2005, FASB issued a Staff Position (FSP) on FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax
Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.

Effective upon issuance, this FSP describes an alternative
transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning
balance of the additional paid-in capital pool


(APIC
pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee
share-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). We elected to use the alternative transition method in fiscal 2006 and have not recognized any excess tax
benefits during fiscal 2007 and 2006.

IRS Revenue Agent's Report.

On June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR") in which the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. This proposed adjustment primarily relates to
transfer pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. We strongly believe the proposed IRS adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable
tax laws, and that we thus have meritorious defenses to this proposed IRS adjustment.

On
July 13, 2005, we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the matter to be referred to the Appeals Division of the IRS. In December 2007,
we reached a tentative settlement with the Appeals Division that would resolve this dispute. The settlement is subject to further review and approval within the government, which we expect will take
several more months, but we believe that settlement is likely. If the settlement becomes final on the tentative terms agreed upon, then we have already adequately provided for this matter. Final
resolution of this matter could take considerable time or may not be finally approved by the government, in which case, while we believe we are still adequately provided for regarding this matter,
there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

In
the third quarter of 2006, the IRS started an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2004. As of the end of fiscal 2007, no adjustments had been
proposed as a result of this audit which would require an adjustment to the tax provision.

Repatriation of foreign earnings.

In fiscal 2005, we recorded tax expense of $11.6 million related to the repatriation
of $360 million, pursuant to The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act) which provides for a special one-time elective dividends received deduction on the
repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer equal to 85% of the eligible distribution.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down
under our credit facility.

(4) proceeds from sale of land of $26.3 million, (5) repurchases of common stock of


$151.6 million,
(6) purchases of investments of $451.7 million, (7) purchases of property and equipment of $44.7 million, and (8) cash paid for acquisitions

Cash provided by operating activities.

Cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our
license agreements. To be classified as upfront revenue, we require that 75% of a term or perpetual license fee be paid within the first year. Conversely, payment terms for TSLs are generally extended
and the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually in even increments over the term of the license. Accordingly, we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than
from time-based licenses revenue.

Cash
provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased collections largely as a result of payments received from a significant customer, a litigation settlement of
$12.5 million received from Magma during fiscal 2007, and decreased commission payments and timing of payments to vendors compared to the same period in 2006.

Cash used in investing activities.

The increase in cash used primarily relates to acquisitions, purchases of marketable
securities related to our increased collections and the timing of maturities of marketable securities, and our capital expenditures to support our information technology infrastructure, partially
offset by cash received for the sale of land in San Jose for $26.3 million, net of related fees.

Cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

The increase in cash provided primarily relates to a higher amount of option
exercises by employees and lower stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program compared to the same period in fiscal 2006. See Note 7 of

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

for details of the stock repurchase program.

We
hold our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and in foreign accounts, primarily in Ireland, Bermuda, and Japan. As of October 31,
2007, we held an aggregate of $722.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and an aggregate of $262.4 million in foreign accounts.
Funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside North America. At present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries. See "Income Taxes" above.

We
expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including timing of our billings and collections, our operating
results, the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions.

Our
accounts receivable and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 36 days at October 31, 2007 and
39 days at October 31, 2006. The


decrease
in DSO along with a slight increase in accounts receivable balance primarily relates to our strong collection efforts and timing of billings to customers that occurred during the year with
subsequent payment terms.

Net Working Capital.

Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of October 31, 2007, our net working capital was $296.5 million, compared to $23.4 million as of October 31, 2006. The increase of
$273.1 million was primarily due to (1) an increase of $248.6 million in cash and cash equivalents including proceeds from sale of land and the Magma litigation settlement,
(2) an increase in short-term investments of $163.2 million, (3) an increase in income taxes receivable and deferred taxes of $10.8 million, and (4) an
increase in prepaid and other of $9.2 million. This increase was partially offset
by an increase in (1) deferred revenue of $131.7 million, (2) accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $12.1, and (3) income taxes payable of $16.2 million.

Other Commitments—Revolving Credit Facility.

On October 20, 2006, we entered into a five-year,
$300.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to Synopsys and certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The amount of the facility may be increased by up to an
additional $150.0 million through the fourth year of the facility. The facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as
well as other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on October 20, 2011. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent's prime
rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at Eurodollar rates plus a spread between 0.50% and 0.70% based on a pricing grid
tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.125% and 0.175% per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. As of
October 31, 2007 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants.

We
believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our credit facility will satisfy our
business requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Purchase
obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or
services as of October 31, 2007. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding,


the
terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

In
connection with our acquisitions completed prior to October 31, 2007, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $9.8 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $7.1 million in cash during the two years subsequent to fiscal 2007 if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved. Because these commitments are
contingent on certain performance and milestone goals, these amounts are not reflected in the table above.

The
expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the
time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone-based obligations depend on the achievement of the
milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly.

As
of October 31, 2007, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to
our short-term investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly
increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality
standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of our investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of
instrument.

The

years, $34.7 million within five to ten years and $124.6 million after ten years. However, we consider these investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance
with our investment policy, the weighted-average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term obligations and
other uses including acquisitions. These investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax.

Foreign Currency Risk.

The functional currency of each of Synopsys' active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's
local currency, except for our principal Irish, Swiss and Hungarian subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the U.S. dollar. We engage in a program to minimize the effect of changes in the
exchange rate between a given functional currency (i.e. the yen in the case of our Japanese subsidiary) and the corresponding non-functional currency transactions (i.e. receivables
denominated in the U.S. dollar in the case of our Japanese subsidiary). We hedge the following types of non-functional-currency-denominated balances and transactions: (1) certain
assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future
intercompany invoices denominated in the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 of

These
foreign currency contracts shown in the above table are denominated primarily in the Euro and the Japanese yen. The maximum original duration of the currency contracts shown is
15 months for our Canadian dollar and British pound forward contracts, 14 months for our Euro forward contracts, two months for our Japanese yen and India Rupee forward contracts, and
one month for other currencies. Due to the short

-

term nature of these contracts, the contract rates approximate fair value as of October 31, 2007
and 2006.


The
success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent
our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions.

For
example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table above providing information as of
October 31, 2007, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $7.5 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $7.5 million to the counterparty upon
contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $7.5 million that
would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.

Net
unrealized gains of approximately $1.5 million and losses of $2.1 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated
balance sheets as of October 31, 2007 and October 31, 2006, respectively.

If
our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such
inaccuracy.

In
the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Synopsys reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of SFAS 133, resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the
standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of Synopsys' hedging program. To
correct the error, Synopsys reclassified the remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in the year ended
October 31, 2005.

Foreign
currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We have
limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk. Furthermore, we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution. We do not enter into forward
contracts for speculative purposes.

Equity Risk.

Our strategic investment portfolio as of October 31, 2007 consists of approximately $13.6 million
of minority equity investments in publicly traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately $4.9 million as of October 31, 2006. The securities of publicly traded
companies are classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. The cost basis of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we reduced the
value of our strategic investment portfolio by $1.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively. None of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes.


Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Synopsys, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2007. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
October 31, 2007 and 2006, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

As
discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of quantifing errors in fiscal 2007 and changed its method of accounting for
share-based compensation in fiscal 2006.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Synopsys, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting
as of October 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated December 21, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

SYNOPSYS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.    Description of Business

Synopsys, Inc. (the Company) is a provider of electronic design automation (EDA) software for semiconductor design companies. The Company delivers
technology-leading semiconductor design and verification platforms and integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing products to the global electronics market, enabling the development and production of
complex systems-on-chips (SoCs). In addition, the Company provides intellectual property (IP) and design services to simplify the design process and accelerate time to market
for the Company's customers. Finally, the Company provides software and services that help customers prepare and optimize their designs for manufacturing.

Note 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year End.

The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest October 31. The Company's current fiscal year
ended November 3, 2007. Fiscal 2007 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were 52-week years. For presentation purposes, the consolidated financial
statements and notes refer to the calendar month end.

Principles of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The functional currency of each of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the foreign
subsidiary's local currency except for the Company's principal Irish, Hungarian, and Swiss subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the United States (U.S.) dollar. Assets and liabilities that are
not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency with any related gain or loss recorded in earnings. The Company translates assets and liabilities of its foreign
operations, except its principal Irish, Hungarian and Swiss subsidiaries, into the U.S. dollar reporting currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The Company translates income
and expense items of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars reporting currency at average exchange rates for the period. Accumulated net translation adjustments are reported in stockholders' equity,
net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

Use of Estimates.

To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments.

The fair value of the Company's cash, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and foreign currency contracts, approximates the carrying amount due to the short duration. Long-term marketable equity investments are valued based on quoted
market prices. Non-marketable equity securities are valued at cost. The Company performs periodic impairment analysis over these non-marketable equity securities.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.

The Company classifies investments with original maturities of three
months or less when acquired as cash equivalents. All of the Company's short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Those unrealized gains or losses deemed other than
temporary are reflected in other income, net. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income, net. The Company
has cash equivalents and investments with


various
high quality institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

The Company sells its products worldwide primarily to customers in the global electronics
market. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and does not require collateral. The Company establishes reserves for potential credit losses
and such losses have been within management's expectations and have not been material in any year presented.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The
Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reduce the Company's receivables to their estimated net realizable value. The Company provides a general reserve on all accounts receivable based
on a review of accounts and a 15 quarter average of write-offs, net of recoveries. Such losses have been within management's expectations and have not been material in any year presented.
The following table presents the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Accounts
written off, net of recoveries

Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109). Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets, excluding land, are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of remaining
term of the lease or the economic useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Depreciation was $51.0 million in 2007, $55.0 million in 2006 and $52.7 million in 2005. The cost
of repairs and maintenance is charged to operations as incurred and was $16.8 million, $16.4 million and $17.4 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
evaluates the recoverability of its property, equipment and intangible assets whenever indications of impairment exist in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived


Assets

(SFAS 144), and records an impairment charge against income as appropriate. A detail of property and equipment is as follows:

Leasehold improvements (average)


During
fiscal 2007, the Company entered into a formal plan to sell its two buildings and a parcel of land in Hillsborough, Oregon. The Company intends to lease-back one of
the buildings. An amount of $18.1 million, representing the net carrying value of the remaining building and the
parcel of land, has been reclassified from property and equipment, net, to asset held-for-sale in prepaid and other current assets in accordance with requirements of
SFAS 144.

Software Development Costs.

Capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility, which is generally the completion of a working prototype and ends upon general release of the product. Capitalized software development costs were approximately $2.3 million,
$3.5 million and $3.0 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amortization of software development costs is computed based on the straight-line method over the
software's estimated economic life of approximately two years. The Company recorded software amortization costs of $2.9 million, $3.0 million and $2.7 million in fiscal 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired by the Company. The goodwill recorded as a result of the business combinations in the years presented is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill
is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually in the Company's fiscal third quarter. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

(SFAS 142), the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts
and circumstances warrant a review. The Company determined that it is a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment tests under SFAS 142. For purposes of assessing the
impairment of goodwill, the Company estimates the value of the reporting unit using its market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value. This fair value is then compared to the carrying value
of the reporting unit. In addition, the carrying value of goodwill maybe affected by the settlement of tax contingencies or the recognition of tax benefits from acquired companies in periods
subsequent to the acquisition date. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and


2005,
there were no impairments to goodwill. As of October 31, 2007, the carrying amount of goodwill was $767.1 million.

Intangible
assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer installed base/relationships, trademarks and tradenames, covenants not to compete, customer
backlog, capitalized software and other intangibles. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from two to ten years.
Amortization of intangible assets was $53.0 million, $59.4 million and $116.1 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company
continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of the long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such
events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through
the undiscounted expected future cash flow. If the future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of these assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. The Company did not recognize intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005. As of October 31, 2007, the carrying amount of
the Company's intangible assets was $78.8 million.

Accounting Standards No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income (Loss)

, which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive
income (loss) and its components in the financial statements. Comprehensive income (loss), as defined, includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources, such as
accumulated net translation adjustments, unrealized gains on certain foreign currency forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, reclassification adjustments related to cash flow hedges and
unrealized gains on investments. Accumulated other comprehensive gain or (loss), net of tax, consists of the following:

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue from software licenses and maintenance and service revenue. Software
license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of Company software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and
professional service fees. The Company's policy is to report, on a net basis (excluded from revenues), sales, use, value added and excise taxes which are charged to customers.


The
Company has designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue
Recognition

, as amended

.

With
respect to software licenses, the Company utilizes three license types:

•

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

, are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the
customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. The Company bundles and does not
charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license.

•

Term licenses

, are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed
software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically
calculated as a percentage of the net license fee.

•

Perpetual licenses

, continue as long as the customer renews maintenance, plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual
licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may
renew annually.

For
the three software license types, the Company recognizes revenue as follows:

•

TSLs

. The Company typically recognizes revenue from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the
license period, or, if later, as customer installments become due and payable. All TSLs are reported as "time-based licenses."

•

Term Licenses

. The Company recognizes revenue from term license fees in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms
require the customer to pay at least 75% of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. These term licenses are reported as "upfront
licenses." For term licenses in which less than 75% of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment, the Company recognizes revenue as customer installments become due and payable. These
due and payable term licenses are reported as "time-based licenses."

•

Perpetual Licenses

. The Company recognizes revenue from perpetual license fees in full upon shipment of the software if
payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. These perpetual licenses are
reported as upfront licenses. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment, the Company recognizes the revenue as customer installments
become due and payable. These perpetual licenses are reported as "time-based licenses."

The
Company's determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). The Company limits its assessment of
VSOE for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately.

The
Company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple-element software arrangements and has determined that it has sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance
components of its perpetual and term license products and to consulting. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, the Company recognizes license revenue from perpetual and
term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, the Company recognizes revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognizes revenue from consulting services as the related
services are performed and accepted. The Company recognizes revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there is not
sufficient VSOE to allocate the TSL fee between license and maintenance services.


The
Company makes significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving its products, the Company must evaluate whether:
(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of software or services has occurred, (iii) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and
(iv) collectibility of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for the Company to recognize revenue with respect to a particular
arrangement. The Company applies these criteria as follows:

•

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists

.    Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, the Company's
customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and the Company or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user
license arrangement or purchase agreement.

•

Delivery Has Occurred

.    The Company delivers software to its customers physically or electronically. For physical
deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when the Company provides the customer access codes, or "license keys," that allow
the customer to take immediate possession of the software by downloading it to the customer's hardware. The Company generally ships its software products promptly after acceptance of customer orders.
However a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and the Company's
operational capacity to fulfill software license orders at the end of a quarter.

•

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable

.    The Company's determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable
depends principally on the arrangement's payment terms. The Company's standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year. If
the arrangement includes these terms, the Company regards the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognizes all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue
recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, the Company does not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognizes revenue when customer
installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, the Company recognizes revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable, due to the fact that VSOE for maintenance services does not
exist for a TSL and due to revenue recognition criteria relating to arrangements that include rights to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology.

•

Collectibility is Probable

.    The Company must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees on a
customer-by-customer basis pursuant to its credit review policy. The Company typically sells to customers with whom it has a history of successful collection. For a new
customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to the Company, the Company evaluates the customer's financial position and ability to pay and typically assigns a credit
limit based on that review. The Company increases the credit limit only after it has established a successful collection history with the customer. If the Company determines at any time that
collectibility is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon its credit review process or the customer's payment history, the Company recognizes revenue under that arrangement as customer
payments are actually received.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

Earnings per Share

(SFAS 128), the Company computes basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the dilution of potential common shares outstanding such as stock
options and unvested restricted stock units and awards during the period using the treasury stock method.


Diluted net income per share excludes 5.7 million, 24.1 million and 27.1 million anti-dilutive options and unvested restricted stock units and awards for
the year ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. While these options and unvested restricted stock were anti-dilutive for the respective periods, they could be dilutive
in the future. No stock options were considered dilutive for the fiscal year ended 2005 as a result of the Company's net loss for the period.

The
table below reconciles the weighted-average common shares used to calculate basic net income (loss) per share with the weighted-average common shares used to calculate diluted net
income per share.

Share-Based Compensation.

On November 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)).

SFAS 123(R)
requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards including stock options, employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans,
non-vested share awards and stock appreciation rights on the date of the grant. The value of awards expected to vest is recognized as expense over the applicable service periods. Prior to
November 1, 2005, the Company accounted for its share-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25), and related guidance. Under the intrinsic value method, the Company did not
recognize any significant amount of share-based compensation expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, as options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the
market value on the date of grant.

The
Company recorded approximately $62.0 million and $63.0 million of share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. In fiscal 2005, share-based
compensation expense related primarily to acquisitions and employee stock option price adjustments in the amount of $6.2 million, under APB 25.

Foreign Currency Contracts.

The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency
exchange rates. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted
transactions and balance sheet positions. These foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value, and are denominated primarily in the Euro and the Japanese yen. The duration of forward contracts
is generally one month, except for forward contracts demoninated in Euro, Canadian dollars or British pounds, which can have a duration not to exceed 15 months. As of October 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, the Company had $207.7 million, $185.3 million and $163.9 million, respectively, of short-term foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. Due to
the short term nature of these contracts, the contract rates approximate fair value as of October 31, 2007 and 2006.

The
components of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as cash flow hedges, with gains and losses recorded in stockholders'
equity and reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted transactions affect earnings. As of October 31, 2007, an unrealized gain of approximately $1.5 million is recorded in
stockholders' equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in
future cash flows for forecasted transactions is approximately three years.


Hedging
effectiveness is evaluated monthly using spot rates, with any gain or loss caused by hedging ineffectiveness reclassified to earnings as other income (expense). The
premium/discount component of the forward contracts is recorded to other income (expense) and is not included in evaluating hedging effectiveness.

In
the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging

(SFAS 133), resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior
year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of the Company's hedging program. To correct the error, the
Company reclassified the remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in the three months ended January 31, 2005. The
earnings impact of gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts, net of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, was immaterial for the fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncement.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements

, (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying misstatements and provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the
effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a
balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative
factors are considered, is material. The transition provisions of SAB 108 allow a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment to retained earnings
for immaterial errors relating to prior years. The Company adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company recorded an adjustment to its opening fiscal 2007 retained earnings balance
in the amount of $14.9 million in accordance with the implementation guidance in SAB 108. The adjustment resulted from an understatement of share-based compensation and an overstatement of
depreciation expense in prior years both of which were immaterial to prior fiscal years under the rollover method.

Subsequent
to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company discovered errors related to selecting the correct employee option grant dates. The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of
Directors undertook an investigation of the Company's stock option grant processes in December 2005 with the assistance of independent counsel and identified no issues relative to grants to
executive officers. These employee grant date errors resulted in an understatement of share-based compensation of $17.3 million in 1999 through 2004. The total cumulative impact of the option
errors is as follows (in thousands):

Retained earnings

(17,341

)

Deferred income taxes

$

In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company performed a review of its property and equipment. It identified certain reserves which were taken in 1999 to write computers and
equipment down to their net realizable value. In years subsequent to the write-down, the Company continued to depreciate the impaired computers and equipment in error. These errors
resulted in an overstatement of depreciation expense of $2.4 million in fiscal years 1999 through 2003.

Historically,
the Company has evaluated uncorrected differences utilizing the rollover approach. The Company believes the impact of the share-based compensation and fixed assets errors,
individually and in the aggregate, were immaterial to prior fiscal years under the rollover method. However, under SAB 108, which the Company was required to adopt effective as of the beginning of
fiscal 2007, the Company assessed materiality using both the rollover and the iron-curtain methods. Under the iron-curtain method, when combined, the cumulative share-based
compensation and fixed asset errors


were
material to the fiscal 2007 financial statements and, therefore, the Company has recorded an adjustment to the opening fiscal 2007 retained earnings balance in the amount of $14.9 million
in accordance with the implementation guidance in SAB 108. The total cumulative impact to retained earning is as follows:

Warranties and Indemnities.

The Company typically warrants its products to be free from defects in media and to substantially
conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days. The Company also
indemnifies its customers from third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to the use of its products and is currently defending some of its customers against claims that their
use of one of its products infringes a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. The Company is unable to estimate the potential impact of these guarantees on the future results of operations. To
date, the Company has not been required to pay any material warranty claims.

Note 3. Business Combinations

During the fiscal years presented, the Company made a number of purchase acquisitions. For each acquisition, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated
value of the net tangible assets acquired was allocated to various intangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technology, customer and contract-related assets and goodwill. The values
assigned to developed technologies related to each acquisition were based upon future discounted cash flows related to the existing products' projected income streams. Goodwill, representing the
excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions, will not to be amortized. Goodwill is not deductible for tax
purposes, with the exception of the MOSAID Technologies, Inc. acquisition discussed below. The amounts allocated to purchased in-process research and developments were determined
through established valuation techniques in the high-technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future
alternative uses existed.

The
consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. The Company does not consider these acquisitions to be material to its
results of operations and is therefore not presenting pro forma statements of operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005.

The
Company acquired SIGMA-C Software AG (Sigma-C) on August 16, 2006 in an all-cash transaction. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily
of legal, tax and accounting fees, estimated facilities closure costs and employee termination costs. As of October 31, 2007, the Company had paid $1.5 million of these costs.

The
Company acquired Virtio Corporation, Inc. (Virtio) on May 15, 2006 in an all-cash transaction. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of legal, tax and
accounting fees, estimated facilities closure costs and employee termination costs which have been substantially paid off as of October 31, 2007. Under the agreement with Virtio, the Company
has also agreed to pay up to $4.3 million over three years to the former stockholders based upon achievement of certain sales milestones. This contingent consideration is considered to be
additional purchase price and will be an adjustment to goodwill when and if payment is made. Additionally, the Company agreed to pay $0.9 million in employee retention bonuses which was
recognized as compensation expense over their service period and has been fully paid as of October 31, 2007.

The
Company acquired HPL Technologies, Inc (HPL) on December 7, 2005 in an all-cash transaction. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of legal, tax and

Fiscal 2005 Acquisitions

Nassda Corporation (Nassda)

The Company acquired Nassda on May 11, 2005.


Purchase Price.

The Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Nassda for total cash consideration of
$200.2 million, or $7.00 per share. In addition, as required by the merger agreement, certain Nassda officers, directors and employees who were defendants in certain preexisting litigation
between Synopsys and Nassda made settlement payments to Synopsys in the aggregate amount of $61.6 million.

Net
of the settlement payments described above, the Company paid $138.6 million in cash to the former shareholders of Nassda. However, in accordance with

EITF 04-01, Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the
Parties to a Business Combination,

the Company was required to separately
value the settlement of the previously existing Nassda litigation and the business combination. The Company determined the fair value of the settlement to be $33.0 million and recorded this
amount as other non-operating income. The Company valued the net assets acquired from Nassda in the business combination at $196.9 million. The total purchase price included
$13.2 million in acquisition-related costs and $12.1 million in vested stock options assumed.

Acquisition-related
costs of $13.2 million consist primarily of professional service fees, which include legal, tax and accounting fees; severance costs for employee termination,
and other directly related charges. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has paid all the costs related to this acquisition.

Assets Acquired.

The Company acquired $30.4 million of intangible assets consisting of $15.7 million in core
developed technology, $7.3 million in customer relationships, $5.9 million in contract rights and $1.5 million in non competes to be amortized over three to five years.
Additionally, the Company acquired tangible assets of $116.7 million and assumed liabilities of $42.5 million.

Goodwill,
representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the merger was $92.4 million.
Goodwill resulted primarily from the Company's expectation of synergies from the integration of Nassda's technology with the Company's technology and operations. During fiscal year 2006, reversal of
$0.5 million acquisition related costs and $2.6 million tax related adjustments resulted in a reduction in goodwill. During fiscal year 2007, $0.6 million tax related adjustments
resulted in a further reduction in goodwill. As of October 31, 2007, the goodwill acquired resulting from the acquisition of Nassda was $88.7 million.

ISE Integrated Systems Engineering AG (ISE)

The Company acquired ISE on November 2, 2004.

Purchase Price.

The Company paid $100.0 million in cash for the outstanding shares of ISE. The total purchase
consideration consisted of:

subsequent to fiscal 2007 to certain former shareholders and option holders of ISE now employed by Synopsys based upon achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones. Amounts paid
under this arrangement were recorded as compensation expense over the service period when management deemed it probable such amounts were earned by the applicable milestone dates.Acquisition-related
costs of $2.6 million consist primarily of legal, tax and accounting fees, facilities closure costs and other directly related charges. During fiscal 2006, the Company reversed
$1.0 million of acquisition costs related primarily to employee severance,


facilities
closure and other contract terminations. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has paid all the acquisition related costs.

Assets Acquired.

The Company acquired $25.7 million of intangible assets consisting of $19.1 million in core
developed technology, $6.1 million in customer relationships and $0.5 million in non competes to be amortized over two to five years. The in-process research and development
(IPRD) expense related to the ISE acquisition was $5.7 million. ISE had one IPRD project—FLOOPS, a next generation process simulator. Additionally, the Company acquired tangible
assets of $19.0 million and assumed liabilities of $15.7 million.

Goodwill,
representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the merger was $72.9 million.
Goodwill resulted primarily from the Company's expectation of synergies from the integration of ISE's technology with the Company's technology and operations. During fiscal year 2006, reversal of
$1.0 million in acquisition related costs and $3.9 million in tax related adjustments resulted in a change in goodwill. During fiscal year 2007, reversal of $0.1 million
acquisition related costs and $2.6 million tax related adjustments resulted in a reduction in goodwill. As of October 31, 2007, the goodwill acquired resulting from the acquisition of
ISE was $73.1 million.

Other.

The Company completed two additional asset acquisitions during fiscal 2005 for aggregate consideration of
$3.0 million. These acquisitions are not considered material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's consolidated balance sheet and results of operations.

five years, $34.7 million within five to ten years and $124.6 million after ten years. Actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to
call or prepay certain obligations. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or
losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Realized gains and losses on sales of short-term investments have not
been material in any period presented.

Strategic Investments.

The Company's strategic investment portfolio consists of minority equity investments in publicly
traded companies and investments in privately held companies. The securities of publicly traded companies are classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115),

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, and are
reported in long-term other assets at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders'
equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Securities of privately held companies are reported at cost net of impairment losses. As of October 31,
2007, the carrying value of the Company's strategic investments was $13.6 million and the Company did not recognize any impairment for the strategic investments during the year.

During
the years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company determined that certain strategic investments with aggregate carrying values of $1.3 million and
$6.5 million, respectively, were impaired and that these impairments were other than temporary Accordingly, the Company recorded charges of approximately $1.3 million and
$4.5 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, to write down the carrying values of these investments.

Notes Payable.

As of October 31, 2006, the Company's notes payable totaled $8.6 million and consisted primarily
of promissory notes payable issued in connection with a 2002 acquisition and notes to secure bonds related to certain property taxes on a parcel of land owned by the Company. During fiscal 2007, the
Company paid off the notes payable issued in connection with the acquisition and notes to secure bonds related to certain property taxes were eliminated upon the sale of the land. As of
October 31, 2007, the Company had no outstanding notes payable.

Credit Facility.

On October 20, 2006, the Company entered into a five-year, $300.0 million senior
unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional $150.0 million
through the fourth year of the facility. The facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to
maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on October 20, 2011. Borrowings under the facility
bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, the Company has the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at
Eurodollar rates plus a spread between 0.50% and 0.70% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.125% and 0.175%
per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. As of October 31, 2007, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and was in compliance with all the
covenants.

Note 6.    Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

position and results of operations.

Note 7.    Stockholders' Equity

Stock Repurchase Programs

The Company is authorized to purchase up to $500.0 million of its common stock under a stock
repurchase program originally established by the Company's Board of Directors (Board) in December 2004 and replenished to $500.0 million in March 2007. The Company repurchases
shares to offset dilution caused by ongoing stock issuances such as existing employee stock option plans, existing stock purchase plans and acquisitions and, also when management believes it is a good
use of cash. Repurchases are transacted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) through open market purchases, plans executed under
Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, and structured transactions.

During
fiscal 2007, the Company entered into a structured repurchase transaction for a portion of its third quarter repurchase activity, with a prepayment of $40.0 million in
exchange for shares at a pre-determined price. Under the terms of the agreement, there is no requirement to return any portion of the prepayment or requirement for the Company to deliver
additional funds. If the average market price of the common stock over the term of the transaction was below the pre-determined price, the Company would receive additional shares of the
Company. The prepayment was recorded as treasury stock on the Company's balance sheet at payment date. Shares were excluded from the number of shares outstanding as of the date of each delivery of
shares. The transaction was completed in the same quarter as the contract was entered into in fiscal 2007.


During
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company purchased 5.7 million shares at an average price of $26.54 per share, 10 million shares at an average price of $19.94 per
share, and 5.1 million shares at an average price of $17.20 per share, respectively. The aggregate purchase prices were $151.6 million, $200.0 million, and $88.4 million in
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, 11.5 million, 4.7 million and 3.6 million shares were reissued respectively, for employee stock option
exercises and employee stock purchase plan requirements.

In
March 2007, the Board replenished the stock repurchase program to $500.0 million. As of October 31, 2007, $429.8 million remained available for further
purchases under the program.

Note 8.    Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan and International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the ESPP), employees are granted the right to
purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at (1) the beginning of a rolling two-year offering period or
(2) the end of each semi-annual purchase period, subject to a plan limit on the number of shares that may be purchased in a purchase period. During the twelve months ended
October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company issued 2,132,295, 2,437,446 and 2,107,556 shares, respectively, under the ESPP at average per share prices of $16.03, $13.73 and $13.49,
respectively. As of October 31, 2007, 3,258,293 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.

Stock Option Plans

2006 Employee Equity Incentive Plan.

On April 25, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the 2006 Employee Equity
Incentive Plan (the 2006 Employee Plan), which provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock
appreciation rights and other forms of equity compensation, including performance stock awards and performance cash awards, as determined by the plan administrator. The terms and conditions of each
type of award are set forth in the 2006 Employee Plan. Options granted under this plan will have a contractual term of seven years. As of October 31, 2007, an aggregate of 27,613,168 stock
options and 1,442,998 restricted stock units were outstanding under this plan.

As
a result of the stockholders' approval of the 2006 Employee Plan, the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan, 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan and 2005 Assumed Stock Option
Plan (collectively, the Prior Plans) have been terminated as to future grants. Should any options currently outstanding under such plans and plans assumed by the Company in acquisitions (24,782,682 as
of
October 31, 2007) expire unexercised, they shall become available for future grant under the 2006 Employee Plan.

An
aggregate of 47,497,248 shares are reserved and 7,738,000 shares were available for future issuance under the 2006 Employee Plan.

In
December 2005 and January 2006, certain executive officers of the Company were granted an aggregate of 420,000 stock options the vesting of which is contingent upon the
Company meeting certain operating margin performance goals in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. These stock options have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant, contingently vest over two years and have a term of seven years. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, the operating margin performance goals were achieved and, as a result 100% of these
stock options became exercisable.

2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan.

On May 23, 2005, the Company's stockholders approved
the 2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the 2005 Directors Plan) and the reservation of 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance there under. The 2005 Directors Plan


provides
for annual equity awards to non-employee directors in the form of either stock options or restricted stock. Stockholders approved a 450,000 share increase in the number of shares
reserved for issuance under the 2005 Directors Plan on April 25, 2006.

The
Company has issued an aggregate of 100,022 shares of restricted stock under the plan as of October 31, 2007 with an aggregate value of approximately $2.1 million. The
share-based compensation expense related to these shares will be amortized over the vesting period of three years. In addition, the Company granted 81,502 of stock options, which vest over a period of
three to four years, with an aggregate fair value of $2.2 million to non-employee directors during fiscal 2007. As of October 31, 2007, 40,095 shares of restricted stock and
81,502 shares of stock options were outstanding. A total of 575,358 shares of common stock were reserved for future grant under the 2005 Directors Plan at October 31, 2007.

1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan.

An aggregate of 898,330 stock options remained outstanding under
the Company's 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan as of October 31, 2007, which expired as to future grants in October 2004.

Option Exchange Program.

In May 2005, the Company's stockholders approved an option exchange program under which
outstanding employee stock options (other than options held by executive
officers) with exercise prices of $25.00 or greater per share could be exchanged for a lesser number of options granted at current fair market value with a new vesting period. On June 23, 2005,
the Company accepted for cancellation options to purchase 7.3 million shares of common stock and in exchange granted to eligible employees options to purchase 3.8 million shares of the
Company's common stock at an exercise price of $17.16 per share, except for small number of options issued with an exercise price of $18.06 due to regional laws regarding the pricing of stock option
grants. As a result of the exchange, the Company recorded option expense of $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 under the provisions of APB 25.

Restricted Stock Units.

Restricted stock units were granted as part of the Company's new hire and annual incentive
compensation program starting in fiscal 2007. Restricted stock units are valued based on the closing price of the Company's stock on the grant date. In general, for non-executive officers,
restricted stock units vest over three to four years and are subject to the employees' continuing service to the Company. Each restricted stock unit grant reduces the number of shares available for
future grants by 1.36 shares and each restricted stock unit cancellation increases shares available for future grants by 1.36 shares under the 2006 Employee Plan. Restricted Stock activities under the
2006 Employee Plan is as follows:

Valuation and Expense of Stock Option and Employee Stock Purchase Plans.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plans awards under SFAS 123(R). The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and interest rates. The expected volatility for both stock options and
employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is estimated by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of the Company's stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical
stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of the Company's share-based awards. The expected term of the Company's share-based awards is based on historical
experience.


The
assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted under the Company's stock option plans and stock purchase rights granted under the Company's employee stock
purchase plan are as follows:

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company provided the disclosures required under SFAS 123 and presented deferred compensation as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R), on November 1, 2005, the Company reclassified the balance in deferred compensation to additional

pro forma purposes, the estimated fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees is amortized over the options' vesting period of four years and the ESPP's
two-year offering period. The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, net of tax effects, for the year ended October 31, 2005 if
the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to share-based awards:

Under
SFAS 123(R), the Company uses the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the service period of the award.

As
of October 31, 2007, $78.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.2 years.

The
Company included all tax benefits for deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in its statement of cash flows prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for those options (excess tax benefits)
to be classified as cash flows from financing activities. To calculate the excess tax benefits available for use in offsetting future tax shortfalls as of the date of implementation, the Company
follows the alternative transition method discussed in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. 123(R)-3. There was no material impact to the Company's
financial statements upon adoption of the alternative transition method in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company has not recorded any excess tax benefits during fiscal 2007 and 2006.

Deferred Compensation Plan.

The Company maintains the Synopsys Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Plan"), which
permits eligible employees to defer up to 50% of their annual cash base compensation and up to 100% of their annual cash variable compensation. Distributions from the Deferred Plan are generally
payable upon termination of employment over five to 15 years or as a lump sum payment at the option of the employee. Since the inception of the Deferred Plan, the Company has not made any
matching or discretionary contributions to the Deferred Plan. There are no Deferred Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on investments. Undistributed amounts under the
Deferred Plan are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. As of October 31, 2007 and 2006, the invested amounts under the Deferred Plan totaled to $74.4 million and
$62.5 million, respectively, and are recorded as long-term other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of October 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has
recorded $78.8 million and $65.8 million, respectively, as long-term liabilities to recognize undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.

Synopsys 401(k) Plan.

The Company sponsors various retirement plans for its eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees.
Total contributions to these plans are charged to operations and were $12.0 million, $10.1 million and $10.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For employees in
the U.S., the Company maintains the Synopsys 401(k) Savings and Success Sharing Plan


(the 401k Plan).
As allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 401k Plan allows tax deferred salary deductions of 1% to 30% of eligible annual salary by
eligible employees. Employee contributions are limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches pretax employee contributions up to 40% of employee
deferrals or a maximum of $1,500 per participant per year. Participants who meet the age requirement before the close of the 401k Plan year may be eligible to make catch-up salary deferral
contributions, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. Catch-up contributions are not eligible for matching contributions.

There
are approximately $2.1 and $3.2 million of deferred tax liabilities that are included in deferred compensation and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for
fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The
valuation allowance increased by $10.2 million principally due to certain foreign deferred tax assets, the tax benefit of which is not considered more likely than not to be
realized in future years.

The
Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $163.0 million as of October 31, 2007, of which $75.7 million will expire in fiscal 2025,
and $87.3 million primarily from acquired companies will expire between fiscal 2018 and 2027.

The
Company has unrecognized deferred tax assets of approximately $13.9 million as of October 31, 2007 attributable to excess tax deductions related to stock options, the
benefit of which will be credited to equity when realized.

The
Company has federal foreign tax credits of $65.5 million of which $60.3 million will expire from fiscal 2013 through 2017 and the remaining $5.2 million in
foreign tax credits from acquired companies, which have a valuation allowance of $2.4 million, will expire between fiscal 2008 and 2011. Foreign tax credits can only be carried forward ten
years. The Company's ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period. Based on available evidence, it is more likely
than not that the Company can utilize the remaining foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The
Company has federal research and development credits of $33.4 million, of which $23.4 million will expire between fiscal 2022 and 2027 and $10.0 million from
acquired companies will expire between fiscal 2008 and 2025.

The
Company has a deferred tax asset of $21.2 million relating to California research and development tax credit carryforwards, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The
Company has also recorded a deferred tax asset of $8.2 million relating to other state tax attributes carried forward for which the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of
$3.0 million.

The
Company has a net deferred tax asset of $7.1 million relating to excess capital loss carryforwards for which the company has recorded a valuation allowance of
$0.8 million. The Company's ability to utilize capital loss carryforwards is dependent upon having sufficient capital gain net income during the carryforward period. Based on available
evidence, it is more likely than not that the Company can utilize the remaining capital loss carryforwards which will expire in fiscal 2010 through 2012.

In
evaluating its ability to utilize its deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results, the existence of
cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions in the most recent fiscal years and its forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2007, the Company
believes that except where a valuation allowance has been provided, it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that
may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies will be sufficient to fully recover the net deferred tax assets.

In
fiscal 2006, the Company reduced additional paid in capital by approximately $8.9 million. The decrease is primarily due to the withdrawal of an incorrect state refund claim
made in 2005 relating to stock option deductions claimed for foreign employees and an overstatement in prior years of the excess tax benefit realized from exercises of stock options assumed in certain
acquisitions. In fiscal 2007, the Company recorded an increase in additional paid in capital by approximately $1.3 million, related to a tax benefit for prior year stock option exercises by
certain non-U.S. employees.

The
Company has not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the Company plans to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the United States. If
the cumulative


foreign
earnings exceed the amount the Company intends to reinvest in foreign countries in the future, the Company would provide for taxes on such excess amount. As of October 31, 2007, there
was approximately $127.6 million of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided.

In
May 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (the 2005 Act) was enacted and provides a three-year exception to current U.S. taxation of
certain foreign intercompany income. The provisions of the 2005 Act first applied to the Company for its fiscal year 2007.

In
December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (the 2006 Act) was enacted, which retroactively extended the research and development credit from January 1,
2006. As a result, the Company recorded an increase in fiscal 2006 R&D credit of $2.2 million.

IRS Revenue Agent's Report.

On June 8, 2005, the Company received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR") in which the
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. This proposed adjustment primarily
relates to transfer pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. The Company strongly believes the proposed IRS adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are
inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that thus has meritorious defenses to this proposed IRS adjustment.

On
July 13, 2005, the Company filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which caused the matter to be referred to the Appeals Division of the IRS. In
December 2007, the Company reached a tentative settlement with the Appeals Division that would resolve this dispute. The settlement is subject to further review and approval within the
government, which the Company expects will take
several more months, but the Company believes that settlement is likely. If the settlement becomes final on the tentative terms agreed upon, then the Company has already adequately provided for this
matter. Final resolution of this matter could take considerable time or may not be finally approved by the government, in which case, while the Company believes it is still adequately provided for
regarding this matter, there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

In
the third quarter of 2006, the IRS started an examination of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2004. As of the end of fiscal 2007, no adjustments had
been proposed as a result of this audit which would require an adjustment to the tax provision.

Repatriation of foreign earnings.

In fiscal 2005, the Company recorded tax expense of $11.6 million related to the
repatriation of $360 million, pursuant to The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act) which provides for a special one-time elective dividends received deduction
on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer equal to 85% of the eligible distribution.

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging

(SFAS 133), resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior
year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of the Company's hedging program. To correct the error, the
Company reclassified the remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income during the year ended October 31, 2005.

Note 11.    Segment Disclosure

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information

, (SFAS 131) requires disclosures of certain information regarding operating segments, products and services, geographic areas of operation and major
customers. SFAS 131 reporting is based upon the "management approach," i.e., how management organizes the Company's operating segments for which separate financial information is
(1) available and (2) evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Synopsys' CODMs are the
Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.

The
Company provides software products and consulting services in the electronic design automation software industry. The Company operates in a single segment. In making operating
decisions, the CODMs primarily consider consolidated financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region. Specifically, the CODMs consider
where individual "seats" or licenses to the Company's products are used in allocating revenue to particular geographic areas. Revenue is defined as revenues from external customers. Goodwill is not


allocated
since the Company operates in one reportable operating segment. Revenues and property and equipment, net related to operations in the United States and other by geographic areas were:

Note 12.    Related Party and Other Transactions

During fiscal 2007, former Director Richard Newton provided consulting services to the Company for which he was paid $16,667. During fiscal 2006 and 2005,
Dr. Newton was paid $180,000 annually under his agreement with the Company. Dr. Newton passed away on January 1, 2007. Under the


Company's
agreement with Dr. Newton, Dr. Newton provided advice concerning long-term technology strategy and industry development issues as well as assistance in identifying
opportunities for partnerships with academia. Dr. Newton was a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California,
Berkeley. Effective September 6, 2006, the Company and Dr. Newton amended the agreement between them. Pursuant to the amended agreement, Dr. Newton's annual compensation for
providing these services was reduced to $100,000 per year.

Andy
D. Bryant, Intel Corporation's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer, served on the Company's Board of Directors from January 1999
until May 2005. Revenues derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 13% of the Company's total revenue for fiscal 2005. Management believes
all transactions between the two parties were carried out on an arm's length basis.

Note 13.    Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48). The interpretation contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement.
In May 2007, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FIN 48-1 (FSP FIN 48-1),

Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
No. 48,

which amended FIN 48 to provide guidance about how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing
previously unrecognized tax benefits. Under FSP FIN 48-1, a tax position could be effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are
satisfied. The provisions are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company is required to make an adjustment to opening retained
earnings for the impact of adoption as well as adjust certain Balance sheet amounts to conform with the new standard. While the Company is in the process of completing its review of FIN 48, it does
not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, certain reclassifications to the Company's assets and
liabilities may be required.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157). The purpose of SFAS 157 is to define fair value, establish a
framework for measuring fair value and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements
of assets and liabilities of a Company. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities, and November 15, 2008 for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The measurement and disclosure requirements are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company is currently evaluating
whether SFAS 157 will result in a change to its fair value measurements and has not yet determined the impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In
February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value measurement to report all
financial instruments at fair value. Its objective is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to use fair value measurement for financial instruments in periods subsequent to adoption
without using the complex hedging-accounting provisions. Under SFAS 159, entities may measure specified financial instruments at fair value on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting period. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007. The requirements are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.


In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R requires the use of "full fair value" to record all the identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination.
SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The requirements are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

In
December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements

(SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires the noncontrolling interests (minority interests) to be recorded at fair value and reported as a component of equity.
SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The requirements are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of October 31, 2007, Synopsys carried out an evaluation under
the supervision and with the participation of Synopsys' management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Synopsys'
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness
of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even


effective
disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving their control objectives.Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of October 31, 2007, (1) Synopsys' disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and
(2) Synopsys' disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports Synopsys files and submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Synopsys' management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding its required disclosure.

(b)

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

.    Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for Synopsys.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007. In making this assessment, our management used the framework established in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Our
management has concluded that, as of October 31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting
firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an auditors' report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

(c)

Changes in Internal Controls.

There were no changes in Synopsys' internal control over financial reporting during the
three months ended October 31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Synopsys' internal control over financial reporting.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Synopsys, Inc.:

We
have audited Synopsys, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Synopsys, Inc.'s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A(b). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Synopsys, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended October 31, 2007, and our report dated December 21, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
