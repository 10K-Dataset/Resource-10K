The Role of EDA in
the Electronics Industry

Technology advances
in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density,
speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors (also
referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips).

·

Since
the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires
imprinted on the chip that form the transistors) and other developments have
enabled IC manufacturers to follow “Moore’s law,” approximately doubling every
two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip.

·

Chips
have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more
powerful handheld devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, music players
and personal digital assistants.

·

Increasingly,
single Systems-on-a-Chip (SoCs) can handle functions formerly performed by
multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board.

Combined, these advances in semiconductor technology
have enabled the development of lower cost, higher performance computers,
wireless communications networks, hand held devices, Internet routers and a
wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new
challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and
manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as
Synopsys.

These technological challenges
have been accompanied by unprecedented business challenges stemming from the
semiconductor downturn in 2000-2002, increased globalization leading
customers to source their products in lower cost areas, and consumer demand for
cheaper and more advanced products.

The IC Design
Process

EDA software enables designers to create complex
semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps
described below.

System
Design.

In
system design, the designer describes the chip’s desired functions in very
basic terms using a specialized high-level computer language, typically C

++

or System C. This phase yields a relatively high level behavioral model of the
chip.

Register
Transfer Level (RTL) Design.

RTL design is the process of capturing the intended
design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level
computer language, typically Verilog or VHDL.

Logic
Design.

Logic
design, or “synthesis,” programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of
the chip, and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various
groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip.

Functional
Verification.

At
the RTL level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools
such as RTL simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to
verify that the design will function as intended. The increasing size and
complexity of today’s ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort
required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to
70% of total design time. As a result, designers are demanding solutions that
can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds, and that can reduce
verification risk (i.e., find design bugs before designs are taken into
production).

Physical
Design.

In
the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of
the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with “place and route”
products. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each
block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each
block, a process known as “placement.” In many designs, placement is performed
in


conjunction with logic
synthesis, a process known as “physical synthesis.” After placement the
designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as “routing.”
With increasing gate counts and design complexity, seamless correlation among
physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important.

Physical
Verification.

Before
sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer
must perform a series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that
the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication
facility that will manufacture the chip.

Design
for Manufacturing.

The
design is then translated to a series of photomasks, or physical
representations of the design. IC manufacturers use photomasks to produce the
silicon wafer containing individual ICs. As IC wire or “feature” sizes shrink,
this translation is becoming more and more difficult. These challenges are
exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than
the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process, requiring
advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to
alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced. Technology
computer-aided design, or TCAD, tools are also used to model individual
features or “devices” within the design to help ensure manufacturability.
Finally, various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this
stage to increase the number of usable ICs contained on each silicon wafer.

Intellectual Property
Reuse.

As IC designs continue to grow in size
and complexity, designers have found that inserting “pre-designed and
pre-verified” design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help
reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip
elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified. Usually such IP
blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ICs,
including microprocessors, digital signal processors, or connectivity IP that
support such protocols as USB, PCI Express or Ethernet.

Strategy

With increasing chip complexity, designers are finding
it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above
sequentially, and must repeat some steps, such as verification, multiple times
before finishing the design. Each such iteration can add significant costs and
makes it more difficult for the designer to meet time-to-market goals. Synopsys
addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product
platforms, enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as
the design moves from one step to the next.

In addition, smaller and smaller chip feature sizes
require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the
production process than ever before. Synopsys has invested heavily in design
for manufacturing tools and technologies that help ensure designs are still
able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an
acceptable yield.

Finally, designers are
under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly
than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition. We address
this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality, pre-verified
standards-based and other IP, which designers can use to complete their design
faster and with greater confidence.

In fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, an aggregate of 49%, 45% and 45%, respectively, of Synopsys’ total
revenue was derived from sales outside of the United States. Additional
information relating to domestic and foreign operations, including revenue and
long-lived assets by geographic area, is contained in Note 10 of our

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

associated with foreign operations are described in Part II, Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Factors That May Affect Future Results—Stagnation
of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations or other international
issues could adversely affect our performance

and is incorporated by reference here.

Historically, our orders
and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth
quarter, with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year
and the first quarter of the next fiscal year, although the timing of major
license renewals can alter this trend. Under our previous license model,
revenue seasonality resulted principally from the decline in the amount of
upfront orders from the fourth quarter of one fiscal year to the first quarter
of the next fiscal year. However, as a result of the shift in our license
model, as more fully described in Part II, Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

, we experienced significantly
less revenue seasonality during fiscal 2005 and we expect revenue seasonality
to be minimal in the foreseeable future.

Synopsys’ aggregate
backlog was approximately $1.92 billion on October 31, 2005, representing
an approximately 25% increase from backlog of $1.53 billion on October 31,
2004. Aggregate backlog includes deferred revenue, operational backlog and
financial backlog. Deferred revenue represents that portion of orders for
software products, license maintenance and other services which have been
delivered and billed to the customer but on which the revenue has not yet been
recognized. Operational backlog consists of orders for software products and
maintenance that have not been shipped and orders for consulting services that
have not yet been delivered and accepted. Financial backlog consists of future
installments not yet due and payable under existing time-based licenses and
maintenance contracts.

We have not historically
experienced material order cancellations.

The
following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our five product groups
as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years. We include
revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered
from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods. For
presentation purposes, we allocate maintenance revenue, which represented
approximately 14%, 16% and 19% of our total revenue in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, to the products to which those support services related.


Revenue derived from Intel
Corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately
13%, 11% and 10% of our total revenue for the fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Research and
Development

Our future performance depends in large part on our
ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms, and to
expand our design for manufacturing and IP product offerings. Research and
development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each
product group. In addition, an Advanced Technology Group within Synopsys’
Silicon Engineering Group explores new technologies and maintains strong
research relationships outside Synopsys with both industry and academia.

During fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, research and development expenses, excluding capitalized software
development costs, were $317.0 million, $285.3 million and
$285.9 million, respectively. Synopsys’ capitalized software development
costs were approximately $3.0 million, $2.7 million, and $2.6 million
in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Competition

The EDA industry is highly competitive. We compete
against other EDA vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and
internal design capabilities. In general, we compete principally on technology leadership,
product quality and features (including ease-of-use), time-to-results,
post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products,
price and payment terms.

Our competitors include
companies that offer a broad range of products and services, such as Cadence
Design Systems, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation, and companies that
offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process,
such as Magma Design Automation, Inc. In recent years, we have increasingly
competed on the basis of payment terms and price. In certain situations, in
order to win business we must offer substantial discounts on our products due
to competitive factors. In other situations, we may lose potential business to
a competitor offering a lower price.

Product Sales and
Licensing Agreements

We typically license our software to customers under
non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and
restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified
geographical areas. The majority of our licenses are network licenses that
allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network,
including, in some cases, regional or global networks. License fees depend on
the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed.

In certain cases, we provide our customers the right
to “re-mix” a portion of the software they initially license for other
specified Synopsys products. For example, a customer may use our front-end
design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such
products for back-end placement software for the remainder of the term in order
to complete the customer’s IC design. This practice helps assure the customer’s
access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. The customer’s
re-mix of product, when so provided under the customer agreement, does not
alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer, which
is governed by our revenue recognition policies. The ability to offer this
right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a
narrower range of products, because customers can obtain more of their design
flow from a single vendor and because customers then have an opportunity to try
additional Synopsys tools before licensing them separately. At the same time,
because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an
additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these
arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the
individual products separately without re-mix rights.


We currently offer our software products under various
license types, including renewable TSLs, term licenses and perpetual licenses.
For a full discussion of these licenses, see Part II, Item 7.

Revenue Background

.

With respect to our DesignWare Core intellectual
property products, we typically license those products to our customers under
nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific
applications. Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design
basis plus, in some cases, royalties.

Finally, our professional
services teams typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers
with statements of work specific to each project.

Proprietary Rights

Synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of
copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and
nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. Our
source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished
copyrighted work. However, third parties may develop similar technology
independently. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may
be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. We currently hold
United States and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our
products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future.

Under our customer
agreements and other license agreements, in many cases we offer to indemnify
our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual
property rights. As a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that
our products infringe on these third party rights. For example, we are
currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one
of our products infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics company.
We believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue
this defense.

Employees

As of October 31,
2005, Synopsys had 4,756 employees, with 2,873 based in North America and 1,883
based outside of North America.

Acquisitions in
Fiscal 2005

During
fiscal 2005, we acquired (i) ISE, expanding our TCAD software offerings, (ii) Nassda
Corporation (Nassda), which

broadens our offering of transistor-level
circuit simulation tools, particularly in the area of mixed-signal and memory
designs, and (iii) certain assets of LEDA Design, a developer of
mixed-signal intellectual property (IP), which will help us meet increasing
customer demand for IP solutions.

Item 2.

Properties

United States
Facilities

Synopsys’ principal offices are located in four
adjacent buildings in Mountain View, California, which together provide
approximately 400,000 square feet of available space. This space is leased
through February 2015. Synopsys occupies approximately 200,000 square feet
of space in two adjacent buildings in Sunnyvale, California under lease through
April 2007, and approximately 72,000 square feet of space in a third
building in Sunnyvale under lease through April 2007. We use these
buildings for administrative, marketing, research and development, sales and
support activities.


We own two buildings totaling approximately 230,000
square feet on approximately 43 acres of land in Hillsboro, Oregon, one of
which is currently vacant. The other is used for administrative, marketing,
research and development and support activities. In addition, we lease approximately
80,000 square feet of space in Marlboro, Massachusetts for sales and support,
research and development and customer education activities. This facility is
leased through January 2009.

Synopsys owns a third building in Sunnyvale,
California with approximately 120,000 square feet, which is leased to a third
party through April 2009. Synopsys also owns 34 acres of undeveloped land
in San Jose, California and 13 acres of undeveloped land in Marlboro,
Massachusetts.

Synopsys currently leases
32 other offices throughout the United States, primarily for sales and support
activities.

International
Facilities

Synopsys leases approximately 45,000 square feet in
Dublin, Ireland for its foreign headquarters and for research and development
purposes. This space is leased through April 2026. In addition, Synopsys
leases foreign sales and service offices in Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the People’s
Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and the United
Kingdom. We also lease research and development facilities in Armenia, Canada,
France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the People’s Republic of China, South
Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

As a result of acquisitions, we have assumed leases in
a number of foreign and domestic locations. Following each acquisition, where
feasible, we consolidate the acquired company’s employees and operations into
our existing local sites. In such cases, we generally seek to sublease the assumed
space or negotiate with the landlord to terminate the underlying lease.

We believe our properties
are adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and that our
facilities have adequate capacity for our current needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

On August 25, 2004, a class action complaint
entitled

Kanekal v. Synopsys, Inc., et al.

, No. C-04-3580,
was filed in federal district court for the Northern District of California
against Synopsys and certain of our officers alleging violations of the
Exchange Act. The complaint purported to be a class action lawsuit brought on
behalf of persons who acquired Synopsys stock during the period of December 3,
2003 through August 18, 2004. The complaint alleged that the individual
defendants caused Synopsys to make false and misleading statements about
Synopsys’ business, forecasts, and financial performance, and that certain
Synopsys officers or employees sold portions of their stock holdings while in
the possession of adverse, non-public information. The complaint did not
specify the amount of damages sought. In November 2004, the Court
appointed a lead plaintiff in the case. In January 2005, the lead
plaintiff, the Wu Group, filed an amended complaint. Synopsys

filed a
motion to dismiss the amended complaint and a motion for sanctions in March 2005.
In August 2005, the Court granted our motion to dismiss, but denied the
motion for sanctions, and allowed the plaintiff 30 days to amend their
complaint. The parties stipulated to a dismissal with prejudice with each
side bearing its own fees and costs, and in September 2005, the case was
dismissed.

In connection with our December 1, 2004 announcement that we had
signed agreements to acquire Nassda Corporation (Nassda) and to settle all
outstanding litigation between the two companies, a class action complaint
entitled

Robert Israel v. Nassda Corporation, et. al

.,
No. 4705695, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
naming Nassda, its directors and Synopsys as defendants. The complaint
purported to be a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of shareholders of
Nassda, other than


the defendant directors and their
affiliates, who allegedly would be injured or threatened with injury if the
proposed acquisition of Nassda by Synopsys proceeded forward on the terms
announced. A class action complaint alleging substantially the same facts was
also filed in California Superior Court. The purported class actions sought to
enjoin the transaction or, alternatively, unspecified damages. In May 2005,
Synopsys completed its acquisition of Nassda. In October, 2005, the Chancery
Court approved a settlement of the Delaware action by
which Synopsys would pay an aggregate of $0.15 per share to each
former shareholder of Nassda (other than the defendant directors and their
affiliates), for a total of approximately $1.8 million, and would pay certain
fees and expenses of plaintiff’s counsel. In December 2005, the
plaintiffs in the Delaware action dismissed their complaint with prejudice and
Synopsys paid the agreed-upon amounts. The California action was also dismissed
with prejudice in December 2005, with each party bearing its own costs.

On May 31, 2005, we
received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) asserting a very large net increase to our U.S. taxable income arising
from the audit of fiscal 2000 and 2001. On June 8, 2005, we received a
Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) in which the IRS proposed to assess a net tax
deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus
interest. Interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally determined
until paid, and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate, which adjusts
quarterly. A higher underpayment rate of interest may be charged as a result of
the issuance of the RAR. On July 13, 2005, we filed a protest to the proposed
deficiency with the IRS, which will cause the matter to be referred to the
Appeals Office of the IRS. We strongly believe the proposed IRS adjustments and
resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and
that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals. See Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

Overview

The following summary of our financial condition and
results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete
discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth below
under the caption entitled “Factors that May Affect Future Results.”
Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part 1 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.

Synopsys’ Business

Synopsys, Inc.
(Synopsys) is a world leader in electronic design automation (EDA) software and
related services for semiconductor design. We deliver technology-leading
semiconductor design and verification software platforms and integrated circuit
(IC) manufacturing software products to the global electronics market, enabling
the development and production of complex systems-on-chips (SoCs). In addition,
we provide intellectual property (IP) and design services to simplify the
design process, and accelerate time-to-market for our customers. We also
provide software and services that help customers prepare their designs for
manufacturing.

Business
Environment

We generate substantially all of our revenue from the
semiconductor and electronics industries. Our customers typically fund
purchases of our software and services largely out of their research and
development (R&D) budgets. As a result, our customers’ business outlook and
willingness to invest in new, and increasingly complex, chip designs heavily
influence our business.

Beginning in late calendar 2000, the semiconductor
industry experienced its steepest and longest downturn of the past 20 years.
Semiconductor industry sales dropped approximately 46% from late 2000 to early
2002 and then recovered slowly into 2003. Throughout this period, our customers
took many steps to reduce their expenses, including constraining R&D and
EDA expenditures, reducing the number of design engineers they employed,
cutting back on their design starts, purchasing from fewer suppliers and
requiring more favorable pricing, payment and license terms from those
suppliers, as well as pursuing consolidation within their own industry.
Further, during this downturn, many semiconductor design companies failed or were
acquired and the pace of investment in new companies declined.

Historically, growth in semiconductor sales has been
followed by growth in semiconductor R&D spending, which in turn has led to
subsequent growth in EDA expenditures. However, although the Semiconductor
Industry Association (SIA) reported semiconductor industry growth of
approximately 18% in 2003 and 29% in 2004, and we believe R&D spending
among large semiconductor companies increased approximately 10% from 2003 to
2004, EDA spending in 2003 and 2004 did not, in fact, track this upturn.

We believe this occurred for a number of reasons.
First, in light of the severity of the 2000-2002 downturn, we believe
customers’ intense focus on expense reduction continued even after the downturn
ended, and that, as a result, they now generally approach spending more
conservatively. Second, the consumer electronics market, in which product price
is a primary competitive factor, has been a key driver of the semiconductor
industry’s recovery. This price pressure has placed pressure on product
development costs and R&D spending. Third, increased globalization has
placed significant pressure on end user product prices and, as a result,
product development costs. Finally, we believe our customers became more cautious
about their own business outlook in mid-calendar 2004 due to a number of
factors, including lack of visibility into their own future results, unexpected
inventory buildup in the semiconductor supply chain and concerns about the
industry’s growth prospects in 2005. These factors have caused our customers to
continue to seek to control costs, including by limiting their EDA spending.


Following the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we
re-evaluated the factors discussed above and the reduced customer demand for upfront
licenses, which have shorter payment terms than time-based licenses and which
had accounted for approximately 26% of our license orders from August 2000
through the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This reduced demand for upfront
licenses materially and adversely affected both our bookings revenue and
operating cash flow for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2004.
Recognizing our customers’ increased preference for conserving cash by paying
for their licenses over time rather than upfront, effective in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 we shifted our target license mix to consist almost
entirely of time-based licenses, in which customers typically pay the license
fee ratably over the term of the license. As a result, upfront licenses
represented approximately 5% of our license orders in the five quarters since
this shift.

We believe this model shift meets our customers’
needs, improves the predictability of our business and helps us preserve the
value of our technology by reducing the need to book a given license or
licenses at the end of a quarter to generate current quarter revenue. However,
this shift negatively impacted our revenue, earnings and cash flow from
operations over the last five quarters and, as a result, revenue and earnings
for the full-year fiscal 2005 were below the levels in full-year fiscal 2004.

Over the long term, EDA spending growth will continue
to depend on growth in semiconductor R&D spending and on continued growth
in the overall semiconductor market. The SIA has forecasted modest growth in
semiconductor revenues in 2006 and we believe semiconductor R&D spending
will grow similarly during 2006. However, we cannot currently predict whether
this outlook will contribute to higher R&D spending and/or to higher EDA spending.
If EDA spending increases, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on
such increases. Further, recognizing that our customers will continue to spend
cautiously and aggressively contain costs, we are intensely focused on
improving our customers’ overall economics of design by providing more
fully-integrated design solutions and offering customers the opportunity to
consolidate their EDA spending with us.

We are under no obligation
(and expressly disclaim any such obligation) to update or alter any of the
information contained in this Overview, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law.

Fiscal 2005 Product
Developments

During fiscal 2005,
we announced or introduced a number of new products and product developments,
including:

·

General
availability of our IC Compiler physical design solution, which unifies
previously separate IC design operations by providing concurrent physical
synthesis, clock-tree synthesis, routing, yield optimization and sign-off
correlation and delivering significant improvements in design performance and
productivity.

·

Announcement
of our PrimeRail comprehensive solution for timing, signal integrity and power
network sign-off.

·

Addition of VCS Assertion IP library and native test bench
support, helping engineers find more design bugs faster and achieve up to five
times faster verification performance.

·

Availability of new TCAD
tools from our acquisition of ISE Integrated Systems Engineering AG in November 2004
and our Sentaurus tool suite which embeds a comprehensive set of core TCAD
products for multi-dimensional process, device and system simulation into a
powerful user interface.

·

Availability of enhanced
analog and mixed-signal offerings through our acquisition of Nassda Corporation
in May 2005.


Fiscal 2005
Financial Performance Summary

·

Revenue
was $991.9 million, down 9% from $1,092.1 million in fiscal 2004, primarily
reflecting our fourth quarter fiscal 2004 license model shift, which
significantly reduced upfront license and related maintenance revenue in fiscal
2005.

·

Time-based
license revenue increased 12% from $663.2 million in fiscal 2004 to $743.7
million in fiscal 2005, primarily reflecting the continued phase-in of our
license model shift as time-based orders booked in prior periods contribute
revenue to current and future periods.

·

Upfront
license revenue declined 72% from $216.0 million in fiscal 2004 to
$60.5 million in fiscal 2005, reflecting our model-driven de-emphasis on
upfront license bookings.

·

We
derived approximately 8% of our software license revenue from upfront licenses
and 92% from time-based licenses in fiscal 2005, versus approximately 25% and
75%, respectively, in fiscal 2004, reflecting our license model shift.

·

Maintenance
revenue declined by 20% from $170.1 million in fiscal 2004 to
$136.3 million in fiscal 2005, primarily as a result of the shift to a
more ratable license model (which reduces new maintenance orders since
maintenance is included with the license fee in time-based licenses and not
reported separately), and, to a lesser extent, by non-renewal of maintenance by
certain existing perpetual license customers.

·

Professional
service and other revenue, at $51.4 million, increased 20% from $42.8 million
in fiscal 2004 due to the timing of customer acceptance of services performed
under ongoing contracts and continued full utilization of our services
capacity.

·

Net
loss was $(15.5) million compared to net income of $74.3 million in fiscal
2004, primarily due to decreased upfront license revenue resulting from our
license model transition, increased research and development expenses caused by
our fiscal 2005 acquisitions of ISE Integrated Systems Engineering AG (ISE) and
Nassda Corporation, and increased sales commissions driven by higher shipments
and other business performance-related compensation, partially offset by a $33
million litigation settlement gain in connection with the Nassda acquisition.

·

Net
cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 increased slightly to $269.2 million
from $264.0 million in fiscal 2004, primarily as a result of collections on
increased bookings, the absence of fiscal 2004 payments relating to the
termination of the Monolithic Systems, Inc. acquisition, and
reduced taxes paid as a result of the net loss for the year, partially
offset by increased payments relating to our information technology
infrastructure.

·

We repurchased
approximately 5.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of
$17.20 per share for approximately $88.4 million.

Fiscal 2005
Acquisitions

During
fiscal 2005, we acquired (i) ISE, expanding our TCAD software offerings, (ii) Nassda
Corporation (Nassda), which

broadens our offering of transistor-level
circuit simulation tools, particularly in the area of mixed-signal and memory
designs, and (iii) certain assets of LEDA Design, a developer of
mixed-signal intellectual property (IP), which will help Synopsys meet
increasing customer demand for IP solutions.

Critical Accounting
Policies

We base the discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations upon our audited consolidated financial
statements, which we prepare in accordance with accounting principles


generally accepted in the
United States of America. In preparing these financial statements, we must make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on
historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

The accounting
policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and
therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:

·

Revenue
recognition;

·

Valuation
of intangible assets and goodwill; and

·

Income
taxes.

Revenue
Recognition.

Synopsys

recognizes revenue from software licenses and maintenance and service revenue. Software
license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of Synopsys
software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees
associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees.

Synopsys has designed and implemented revenue
recognition policies in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, as
amended by SOP 98-9,

Modification of
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.

With respect to
software licenses, Synopsys utilizes three license types:

·

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

are for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to
receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for,
unspecified future technology. We bundle and do not charge separately for
post-contract customer support (maintenance or PCS) for the term of the
license.

·

Term licenses

are also for a finite term,
but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed
software for unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance
separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the
term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the
net license fee.

·

Perpetual licenses

continue as long as the customer renews
maintenance, plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not
provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software
for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately
for the first year and may renew annually.

For the three
software license types, we recognize revenue as follows:

·

Technology Subscription Licenses

.   Synopsys
typically recognizes revenue from TSL license fees (which include bundled
maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period, or, if later, as
customer installments become due and payable. All TSLs are reported as
“time-based licenses.”

·

Term Licenses

.   Synopsys recognizes
the term license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software, payment terms
require the customer to pay at least 75% of the term license fee within one
year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Such
term licenses are reported as “upfront licenses.” For term licenses where less
than 75% of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment, Synopsys
recognizes revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Due and
payable term licenses are reported as “time-based licenses.”

·

Perpetual Licenses

.   Synopsys
recognizes the perpetual license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software,
payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the perpetual license
fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria
are met. Such perpetual


licenses are reported as
upfront licenses. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license
fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize the revenue as
customer installments become due and payable. Such perpetual licenses are
reported as time-based licenses.

Synopsys allocates revenue on software transactions
(referred to as “arrangements”) involving multiple elements to each element
based on the relative fair values of the elements. Our determination of fair
value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific
objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element to
the price charged when the same element is sold separately.

We have analyzed all of the elements included in our
multiple-element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient
VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and
term license products and to consulting. Accordingly, assuming all other
revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from perpetual and
term licenses upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9,
we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and we
recognize revenue from consulting services as the related services are
performed and accepted.

Synopsys makes
significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in
connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether:
(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has
occurred, (iii) its fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility
is probable. We apply these criteria as discussed below.

·

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists

.   Prior
to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary practice is to have a
written contract, signed by both the customer and Synopsys or a purchase order
from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user
license arrangement or volume purchase agreement.

·

Delivery Has Occurred

.   We deliver
software to our customers physically or electronically. For physical
deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. For
electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide the customer access
codes, or “keys,” that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the
software on its hardware.

·

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable

.   Our
determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends
principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms
require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year. Where
these terms apply, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize
revenue upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are
met). If the payment terms do not meet this standard, which we refer to as “extended
payment terms,” we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and
generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In
the case of a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or
determinable, due to the fact that maintenance services are included with the
software license and due to guidelines relating to arrangements that include
rights to receive unspecified future technology.

·

Collectibility is Probable

.   To recognize revenue, we
must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees, which we do on a
customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically
sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a
new customer or where an existing customer substantially expands its
commitments to us, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to
pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the
credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history
with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectibility is not
probable based upon its credit review process or the customer’s payment
history, we recognize revenue on a cash-collected basis.


We recognize
maintenance and service revenue as follows:

·

Maintenance Fees Associated with Perpetual and Term
Licenses

.   Synopsys recognizes revenue from maintenance
associated with perpetual and term licenses ratably over the maintenance term.

·

Professional Service Fees

.   Synopsys
recognizes revenue from consulting and training services as services are
performed and accepted.

Valuation
of Intangible Assets and Goodwill.

We evaluate our intangible assets
for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets
consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer-installed
base/relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not to compete,
customer backlog, and other intangibles. Factors that could trigger an
impairment review include significant under-performance relative to
expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes
in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this
evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we
make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset
over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the
intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period, we reduce
the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may
adjust the remaining amortization period. Any such impairment charge could be
significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial
statements. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets
during fiscal 2005. As of October 31, 2005, the carrying amount of our
intangible assets, net was $142.5 million.

We operate in one operating segment. We evaluate
aggregate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on
our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(SFAS 142). In addition, we evaluate goodwill for indications of
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment
review include significant under-performance relative to expected
historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the
manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this
evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired, we assess
the impairment of the goodwill using the two-step method prescribed by
SFAS 142. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a
material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. We did not record
any impairment charges on our goodwill during fiscal 2005. As of October 31,
2005, the carrying amount of our goodwill was $729.0 million.

Income
Taxes.

We make
certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax liabilities and the
determination of net deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
differences between tax and financial statement recognition methods. Significant
changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax
provision in a subsequent period.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109),
also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance,
if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in
future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets,
in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence,
including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the
most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a
jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. In determining future taxable income, we
are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state, federal
and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary
differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning
strategies. These


assumptions require
significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent
with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
We believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will
ultimately be realized. However, should there be a change in our ability to
recover all or part of the deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the deferred
tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded as a charge to earnings in the
period such determination is made.

In addition, the
calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated
with the application of complex tax laws. We are also subject to examination by
various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our
financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to
be paid as a result of such examinations. If it is ultimately determined that
payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the liability would be reversed and
the tax benefit would be recognized in the period in which it is determined
that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment
exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, an additional charge to expense will
result. See

taxable income arising from the audit of fiscal years 2000 and 2001.

Results of
Operations

Revenue Background

We generate our revenue from the sale of software
licenses, maintenance and professional services. Under current accounting rules and
policies applicable to different kinds of license arrangements, we recognize
revenue from orders we receive
for software licenses and services at varying times. In general, we recognize
revenue on a time-based software license order or TBL, over the license term,
and on an upfront term or perpetual software license order at the time the
license is shipped. Substantially all of our current time-based licenses are
technology subscription licenses, or TSLs, with an average license term of
approximately three years. Maintenance orders generally generate revenue
ratably over the maintenance period (generally, one year). Professional service
orders generally generate revenue upon completion and customer acceptance of
contractually agreed milestones. A more complete description of our revenue
recognition policy can be found above under

Critical
Accounting

Policies

.

Our revenue
in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time-based license, upfront
license, maintenance and professional service revenue for such period. We derive time-based license revenue
in any quarter almost entirely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters. We derive upfront
license revenue directly from upfront license orders booked and shipped during
the quarter. We derive maintenance
revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance
orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional service revenue almost
entirely from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue
from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted, not
when they are booked. We derive upfront license revenue directly from upfront
license orders booked and shipped during the quarter.

Our license revenue is
very sensitive to the mix of time-based and upfront licenses delivered during
the quarter. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but
contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a
three-year TSL shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no
revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters.
Conversely, upfront licenses generate higher current quarter revenue but no
future revenue (e.g., a $120,000 order for an upfront license generates
$120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped, but no future
revenue). TSLs also result in a shift of maintenance revenue to time-based
license revenue since maintenance is included in TSLs, while maintenance on upfront orders is charged and reported separately.


License Order Mix

The
percentage of upfront licenses we book is driven by a number of factors,
including the level of overall license orders, customer demand, preferred
customer payment terms and customer-requested ship dates. Prior to August 2000,
substantially all of our license revenue was upfront. Beginning in August 2000,
when we introduced TSLs, we shifted our target license order mix to
approximately 75% TSLs and 25% upfront licenses, based on our expectations of
total orders and our assessment of the demand for upfront licenses. We
substantially maintained this mix from this date through fiscal 2003. However,
as a result of reduced customer demand for upfront licenses as described above
in “Business Environment,” we shifted to an almost completely time-based
license model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Our actual license order
mix for the last nine fiscal quarters is set forth below.

In certain cases, our
time-based and upfront term license agreements provide the customer the right
to “re-mix” a portion of the software initially licensed for other Synopsys specified
products. The customer’s re-mix of product, when allowed under the license
arrangement, does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid
by the customer. Because in such cases the customer does not need to obtain a
new license and pay additional license fees to use the additional products,
these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the
individual products separately. However, we believe providing our customers
re-mix rights can also assist in broader adoption of our products.

The decrease in total
revenue for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to our
license model shift begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which
significantly reduced both upfront license fees and maintenance revenue in
fiscal 2005. The decrease in total revenue for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal
2003 was due primarily to (i) a lower level of orders than expected in
fiscal 2004, (ii) our shift in the fourth quarter to an almost completely
ratable license model and (iii) lower maintenance revenue.

Time-Based License Revenue

The increase in time-based
license revenue in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to our
fourth quarter fiscal 2004 license model shift under which previously booked
orders continue to contribute to revenue in later periods.

The increase in time-based revenue in fiscal 2004
compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the continued phase-in of our initial
August 2000 ratable license model shift and to the full-year revenue
contribution in fiscal 2004 from a strong level of time-based license orders
received during fiscal 2003.


Upfront License Revenue

The decrease in upfront license revenue, in both
percentage and absolute dollar terms, for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004
was primarily due to the fact that we shipped a substantially
higher-than-average percentage of orders as upfront licenses in the second and
third quarters of fiscal 2004 and subsequently shifted to a higher ratable
license mix in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The decrease in upfront revenue
for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the shift to a
higher ratable license model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and to
lower-than-expected upfront orders in dollar terms in the third quarter of
fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003.

Unfilled upfront license
orders were approximately $4.5 million at October 31, 2005 compared to
$5.3 million as of October 31, 2004. Unfilled upfront license orders
represent non-cancelable license orders we have received from our customers but
have not shipped as of the end of the applicable fiscal period. We generally
ship our software products promptly after acceptance of customer orders.
However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as
a result, timing of revenue recognition, including: the delivery dates
requested by customers, the effect of the related license revenue on our
business plan, and our operational capacity to fulfill upfront software license
orders at the end of a quarter.

Maintenance and Service Revenue

Our maintenance revenue has declined due to (i) our
continued shift towards TSLs, which include maintenance with the license fee
and thus generate no separately recognized maintenance revenue, (ii) generally
lower maintenance rates on perpetual license transactions above $2 million, and
(iii) to a lesser extent, non-renewal of maintenance by certain customers
on perpetual or other upfront licenses. With our license model shift, we,
expect progressively more of our maintenance revenue to be included in TSL
revenue, and therefore for our separately recognized maintenance revenue to
continue to decline. In addition, some customers may choose in the future not
to renew maintenance on upfront licenses for economic or other factors, which
would also adversely affect future maintenance revenue.

Professional service and
other revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and 2003 due to
timing of customer acceptance of services performed under ongoing contracts.


Events
Affecting Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses

Temporary Shutdown of
Operations.

As
a cost saving measure, we temporarily shut down operations in North America for
three days during the first quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
four days during the third quarters of fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively,
resulting in savings of approximately $4.4 million in fiscal 2005,
$7.6 million in fiscal 2004 and $4.8 million in fiscal 2003. The savings
in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 relate primarily to salaries and benefits and are
reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows:

Workforce Reduction.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we reduced expenses by decreasing
the number of employees in most departments in domestic and foreign locations.
This workforce reduction affected approximately 84 employees in fiscal 2004 (50
employees in the U.S. and 34 employees outside the U.S.), and 200 employees in
fiscal 2003 (130 employees in the U.S. and 70 employees outside the U.S.),
resulting in charges of approximately $6.6 million in fiscal 2004 and
$4.4 million in fiscal 2003. The charges in each fiscal year relate
primarily to severance and other special termination benefits and are included
in our consolidated financial statements as follows:

Workforce Realignment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003 and effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we realigned our
operations to focus resources on more strategic areas of investment and to
become more operationally efficient. This realignment affected most departments
and resulted in termination of employment of a total of 140 employees in the
United States and 100 employees outside the United States. Charges for
severance and other termination benefits totaling $14.9 million were
reflected in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2003 as follows.


Certain Option Expenses.

Subsequent to the fourth

quarter of
fiscal 2005, we discovered an error in our option grant process related to the
documentation of grant dates. This error was solely with respect to grants to
non-executive officer employees. The impact of this error on our first through
third quarter income statement was approximately $3.1 million. We booked in the
fourth quarter $3.6 million as follows: $0.5 million in cost of goods sold,
$1.3 million in research and development expense, $0.9 million in sales and
marketing expense and $0.9 million in general and administrative expense. Our
results of operations for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2005
contained in our earnings release dated November 30, 2005 did not include
this expense as we did not believe at that time the error would result in an
adjustment to our operating results. With the error corrected, we expect we
will incur no additional expenses relating to this error.

Functional
Allocation of Operating Expenses

Historically, we allocate
certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses
among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each
functional area. Annually, upon a significant change in headcount (as in the
case of a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition), or as a result of
other business-related factors, management reviews the allocation methodology
and the expenses included in the allocation pool. We conducted such a review
following our workforce realignment in fiscal 2004, the ISE acquisition
completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and the Nassda acquisition
completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The resulting expense
allocations may contribute significantly to fluctuations in individual
operating expenses from period to period.

Cost of Revenue

We divide cost of revenue into three categories: (i) cost
of license revenue, (ii) cost of maintenance and service revenue and (iii) amortization
costs. In April 2005 we revised our methodology for allocating and
reporting cost of revenue externally to better align costs of revenue with the
appropriate revenue categories. We have reclassified cost of revenue for fiscal
2003 and 2004 to conform to this new allocation methodology. In addition, we
have segregated expenses directly associated with providing consulting and
training from costs of revenue associated with internal functions which provide
license delivery and post-customer contract support services. Management then
allocates these consulting and training costs between cost of license revenue
and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on the proportion of license
revenue and maintenance and service revenue reported during the quarter. In
general, our total cost of revenue is relatively fixed and does not fluctuate
significantly with changes in revenue or license mix.

Cost
of license revenue.

Cost
of license revenue includes costs associated with the sale and licensing of our
software products, both time-based and upfront. Cost of license revenue
includes the allocated cost


of employee salary and
benefits for providing software delivery, including software production costs,
product packaging, amortization of capitalized software development costs
related to Synopsys products, documentation and royalties payable to third
party vendors.

Cost
of maintenance and service revenue.

Cost of maintenance and service
revenue includes employee salary and benefits for consulting professionals and
associated costs to maintain the related infrastructure necessary to manage a
services and training organization. Further, cost of maintenance and service
revenue includes allocated costs of employee salary and benefits for providing
customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support, production employees
and documentation of maintenance updates.

Amortization
costs.

Amortization of intangible assets and
deferred stock compensation includes the amortization of the contract rights
intangible associated with certain executory contracts, core/developed
technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to
compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed during fiscal
2003, 2004 and 2005. We amortize intangible assets on a straight-line basis
over their useful lives, which range from two to ten years. Deferred stock
compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed
in connection with prior and current year acquisitions. We amortize the
deferred stock compensation over the options’ remaining vesting period of one
to four years. Generally, amortization of deferred stock compensation will
decrease over time as the assumed stock options vest, although employee
terminations affect the exact timing and amount of future amortization of
deferred stock compensation.

The decrease in total cost of revenue in fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to: (i) net reduction of $20.8
million in amortization expense in core/developed technology caused by
completion of amortization from fiscal 2002 acquisitions, primarily the
acquisition of Avant! Corporation, and (ii) the reduction in royalty
expense of $1.3 million primarily resulting from an accrual of $1.0 million
recorded in fiscal 2004 for a potential payment that was determined not
required to be paid. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of: (i) $14.0
million in compensation and employee benefits as a result of (a) our
increased investment in professional services personnel and (b) higher
variable compensation associated with our higher-than-expected business
performance; (ii) $1.2 million in compensation due to former ISE employees
based on achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones; and (iii) $3.2
million in additional human resources, 
information technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item
compared to fiscal 2004. See “

Functional Allocation of
Operating Expenses,

” above. Total cost of revenue as a percentage of
total revenue increased due to lower revenue during 2005 as compared to the
revenue in fiscal 2004 and the fact that a large portion of our expenses are
fixed.

The increase in total cost
of revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to: (i) an
increase in amortization of $9.7 million of core/developed technology
recorded as a result of our acquisitions completed in fiscal 2003 and 2004; (ii) an
increase of $9.1 million in field support personnel costs due to targeted
hiring in the customer support function; and (iii) $3.6 million in
additional human resources,  information
technology and facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal
2003. See “

Functional Allocation of Operating Expenses,

”
above. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of: (i) $1.1
million in expenses relating to consulting services; (ii) $2.6 million in
employee expenses as discussed above under

Workforce
Realignment

; and (iii) $1.1 million higher royalty
expenses in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Total cost of revenue as a
percentage of total revenue increased due to lower revenue during 2004 and
increased amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation
from acquisitions in fiscal 2003.


Operating Expenses

Research and Development

The increase in research and development expense in
fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to: (i) an increase
of $30.9 million in research and development personnel and related costs
primarily as a result of the ISE and Nassda acquisitions, including $5.3
million in compensation due to former ISE employees now employed by Synopsys
based upon achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones; and (ii) an
increase of $4.7 million in human resources, information technology and
facilities costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2004 as a
result of increased headcount. This increase was partially offset by a decrease
of $2.7 million in contractor costs as many former contractors in lower-cost
regions were converted to employees.

Research and development
expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 remained relatively constant as
a result of the following offsetting factors: (i) a $2.2 million
reduction in depreciation expense allocated to this line item as a result of
decreased capital spending and lower replacement costs in fiscal 2004 compared
to fiscal 2003; (ii) severance packages totaling $1.4 million
associated with our workforce reduction during fiscal 2003 which were not
incurred during fiscal 2004; (iii) a $1.6 million decrease in consulting
services in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003; (iv) a $4.5 million
decrease in North America human resources, information technology and
facilities costs allocated to research and development expenses in fiscal 2004
as a result of the decrease in research and development headcount as a
percentage of total headcount; and (v) an increase of $10.1 million
in fiscal 2004 research and development personnel and related costs as a result
of increased investment in research and development activities.

Sales and Marketing

The increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal
2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to: (i) an increase of
$27.8 million in variable compensation driven by increased shipments, higher
commission rates applied to shipments beginning in fiscal 2005 and increased
business performance-related compensation; (ii) an increase of $4.6
million in sales and marketing personnel and related costs due to increased
headcount and acquisitions during the fiscal year; and (iii) an increase of
$4.6 million in severance-related costs associated with a workforce reduction
executed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005. These increases
were partially offset by decreases of: (i) $4.2 million as a result of a
reduction in expenses for sales conferences and related meetings; (ii) $1.6
million in human resources, information technology and facilities corporate
allocated costs allocated to this line item compared to fiscal 2004 as a result
of decreased headcount; (iii) $1.2 million related to reduced depreciation
to this line item as a result of reduced headcount; and (iv) $1.0 million
related to reduced travel expenses.

The decrease in sales and
marketing expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to: (i) a
reduction of $4.0 million in variable compensation, driven by reduced
orders and shipments in fiscal 2004; (ii) a reduction of $3.0 million
in sales and marketing personnel and related costs as a result of


decreased
headcount due to previous workforce reductions and realignments; and (iii) $4.8 million
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of our realignment of
operations as discussed above under

Workforce
Realignment

. This decrease was partially offset by increases of: (i) $4.4 million
in human resources, information technology and facilities costs allocated to
sales and marketing expenses as a result of the increase in sales and marketing
headcount as a percentage of total headcount, and (ii) $1.2 million
related to expanded marketing efforts and charges associated with the
cancellation of certain sales employee-related functions.

General and Administrative

Fiscal 2004 general and administrative expenses were
higher than fiscal 2005 primarily due to: (i) the $10 million merger
termination fee paid to Monolithic System Technology, Inc. (MoSys) in April 2004
in connection with termination of an acquisition agreement; (ii)  $5.4
million in professional service fees primarily related to litigation associated
with the MoSys termination incurred in 2004; (iii) $1.7 million in
professional services fees incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition
of MoSys expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004; (iv) a decrease of
$3.2 million in bad debt reserve in fiscal 2005 due to lower than anticipated
billings and successful collection efforts; (v) a decrease of $1.9 million
in facilities costs in fiscal 2005 due to closure of certain facilities; and (vi) a
decrease of $6.3 million in human resources, information technology and
facilities costs allocated to this line item in fiscal 2005. Lower fiscal 2005
expenses were partially offset by an increase of (i) $3.5 million in
employee compensation in fiscal 2005 due to increased headcount; (ii) $2.2
million in depreciation due to increased equipment and assets; and (iii) $2.7
million in consulting costs primarily related to market and internal business
process analyses. See “

Functional Allocation of
Operating Expenses,

” above.

The increase in general
and administrative expense in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily
due to: (i) the $10.0 million termination fee paid to MoSys and
professional service fees of $7.1 million relating to that transaction and
the subsequent litigation in fiscal 2004; (ii) an increase of
$5.0 million in professional service fees in fiscal 2004 relating to other
litigation matters; (iii) $4.7 million in facilities costs primarily
related to planned facilities consolidation in fiscal 2004; (iv) a loss of
$1.1 million related to the sublease of a portion of our Ireland
headquarters facility in fiscal 2004; and (v) a $3.5 million increase
in depreciation due to increased capital spending in information technology.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in
human resources, information technology and facilities costs allocated to this
line item. See “

Functional Allocation of Operating Expenses,

”
above.

In-Process Research
and Development

In-process research and development (IPRD) is comprised
of in-process technologies of (i) $5.7 million associated with the
acquisition of ISE in fiscal 2005; (ii) $1.6 million associated with an
acquisition in fiscal 2004 considered immaterial for financial statement
purposes; (iii) $18.3 million associated with our acquisition of Numerical
Technologies, Inc. (Numerical) described below; and (iv) $1.6 million
associated with an acquisition considered immaterial for financial statement
purposes in fiscal 2003. At the date of each acquisition, the projects associated
with the IPRD efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the
research and development in process had no alternative future uses.
Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the respective
acquisition date of each of the acquired companies.


Valuation
of IPRD.

The
value assigned to acquired in-process technology is determined by identifying
products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not
been established as of the acquisition date. The value of in-process technology
is then divided into two classifications: (i) developed technology
(completed) and (ii) in-process technology (to-be-completed), giving
explicit consideration to the value created by the research and development
efforts of the acquired business prior to the date of acquisition and to be
created by Synopsys after the acquisition. These value creation efforts were
estimated by considering the following major factors: (i) time-based data,
(ii) cost-based data and (iii) complexity-based data.

The value of the in-process technology was determined
using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach, focusing on
the income producing capabilities of the in-process technologies. Under this
approach, the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution
generated by each of the identified products within the classification
divisions. Revenue estimates were based on (i) individual product
revenues, (ii) anticipated growth rates, (iii) anticipated product
development and introduction schedules, (iv) product sales cycles, and (v) the
estimated life of a product’s underlying technology. From the revenue
estimates, operating expense estimates, including costs of sales, general and
administrative, sales and marketing, income taxes and a use charge for
contributory assets, were deducted to arrive at operating income. We estimated
revenue growth rates for each product and gave consideration to relevant market
sizes and growth factors, expected industry trends, the anticipated nature and timing
of new product introductions by us and our competitors, individual product
sales cycles and the estimated life of each product’s underlying technology.
Operating expense estimates reflect Synopsys’ historical expense ratios.
Additionally, these projects will require continued research and development
after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility.
The resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present
value at the date of acquisition.

The rate used to discount the net cash flows from
purchased in-process technology is our weighted-average cost of capital,
taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various
areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future
revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired in-process technology,
the useful life of such technology, the profitability levels of such
technology, if any, and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which
are unknown at this time.

ISE.

On November 2, 2004, we
acquired ISE, a world-leading provider of TCAD (Technology Computer-Aided
Design) software and related services. The IPRD expense related to the ISE acquisition
was $5.7 million. ISE had one IPRD project—FLOOPS, a next generation
process simulator. We incurred a minimal amount in IPRD related to this project
which led to the introduction of our Sentaurus product in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005. This project is considered to be complete except for ongoing
maintenance, future product enhancements and new features related to this core
product. Expenditures to complete ISE’s acquired in-process technologies
approximated the original estimates.

Numerical.

On March 1, 2003, we acquired
Numerical, which specialized in subwavelength lithography-enabling
solutions. The IPRD expense related to the Numerical acquisition was
$18.3 million. Numerical had five IPRD projects—Phase Shift Masking (PSM),
Subwavelength Software, Equipment Software, Cadabra and Computer Aided
Transcription System (CATS)—representing 25%, 7%, 6%, 5% and 57%, respectively,
of the total IPRD value. These projects were expected to be completed shortly
following the merger. PSM, Subwavelength Software and CATS software were
completed in fiscal 2003. Our Cadabra

®

product was released in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Equipment Software project consists of
in-process technology for multiple products. These products were either
completed in fiscal 2003, discontinued, or were integrated with other Synopsys
products during fiscal 2004. Expenditures to complete Numerical’s acquired
in-process technologies approximated the original estimates.


Amortization of Intangible
Assets and Deferred Stock Compensation.

Amortization
of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation includes the amortization
of the contract rights intangible associated with certain executory contracts,
core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships,
covenants not to compete and other intangibles acquired in business
combinations completed during fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005. We amortize
intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which range
from three to ten years. Deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic
value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with prior year
acquisitions. We amortize deferred stock compensation on a straight-line basis
over the options’ remaining vesting period of one to four years.
Generally, amortization of deferred stock compensation will decrease over time
as the assumed stock options vest, although employee terminations affect the
exact timing and amount of future amortization of deferred stock compensation.
Amortization expense for these assets is included in the consolidated
statements of operations as follows:

The decrease in amortization of intangible assets and
deferred compensation in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is driven by
completion of the amortization of the intangible assets related to
core/developed technology from fiscal 2002 acquisitions, primarily the
acquisition of Avant!, and by the declining amounts of amortization related to
deferred compensation recorded in prior year acquisitions, partially offset by
amortization charges from the ISE and Nassda acquisitions.

The increase in amortization of intangible assets and
deferred compensation in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due
to additional amortization of assets acquired in the Numerical acquisition in
the second quarter of fiscal 2003, partially offset by the declining amounts of
amortization related to deferred compensation recorded in prior year
acquisitions.

See Note 4 to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

for a schedule of future
amortization amounts.

Impairment
of Intangible Assets.

There
were no material impairment charges related to intangible assets during fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003.

Expensing
of Stock Awards.

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), which will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
SFAS 123R will result in our recognition of substantial compensation
expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase
plans. Synopsys currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure
compensation expense for stock-based awards to its employees. Under this
standard, we generally have not recognized any compensation expense related to
stock option grants we issue under our stock option plans or related to the
discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans. Under the new
rules, we will be required to adopt a fair-value-based method for
measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards, which will
lead to substantial additional compensation expense and therefore will have a
material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. Note 2 to
our

Consolidated Financial Statements

provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a
fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under
SFAS 123R to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards
during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003.


Other Income (Expense), Net

In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we  reevaluated our interpretation of certain
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as
amended,

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 133), resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the
standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect
of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the
economics of our hedging program. To correct the error, we reclassified the
remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other
comprehensive loss to other income in the year ended October 31, 2005.

The increase in other income (expense) in fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to (i) the $33 million gain from
the litigation settlement relating to the Nassda acquisition; and (ii) the
reclassification of $3.0 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to
other income. This increase is primarily offset by $4.5 million write-down of
certain investments.

See Notes 3 and 9 to

Consolidated Financial Statements.

The decrease in other
income (expense) in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to
reduced investment gains and reduced rental income.

Income Tax Rate

Income
Taxes.

The
relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly
affect our effective tax rate. We are also subject to changing tax laws in the
multiple jurisdictions in which we operate. As of October 31, 2005,
current deferred tax assets, net of current deferred tax liabilities, totaled
$195.5 million. Non-current deferred tax assets, net of non-current deferred
tax liabilities, totaled $82.4 million. We believe it is more likely than not
that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income
to utilize our net deferred tax assets. We consider future taxable income and
ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for
any valuation allowance, and if we determine we would not be able to realize
all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would charge to
income an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that
determination.

We provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of
our foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested
outside of the U.S. As of October 31, 2005, there was no cumulative amount
of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided.

IRS
Revenue Agent’s Report.

On May 31, 2005, we
received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) asserting a very large net increase to our U.S. taxable income arising


from the audit of fiscal
years 2000 and 2001. On June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report
(RAR) in which the IRS proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years
2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. Interest accrues
on the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid, and compounds
daily at the federal underpayment rate, which adjusts quarterly. A higher
underpayment rate of interest may be charged as a result of the issuance of the
RAR.

This proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer
pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary.
The proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total amount
relating to these transactions asserted under the IRS theories. On July 13,
2005, we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which will
cause the matter to be referred to the Appeals Office of the IRS. Resolution of
this matter could take a considerable time, possibly years.

We strongly believe the proposed IRS adjustments and
resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and
that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals. Accordingly, we will
continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. While we believe
the IRS’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law, we believe
it is probable that we will be required to make additional payments in order to
resolve this matter. However, based on our analysis to date, we believe we have
adequately provided for this matter. If we are required to pay a significant
amount of additional U.S. taxes and applicable interest in excess of our
provision for this matter, our results of operations and financial condition
could be materially and adversely affected.

Repatriation
of Foreign Earnings.

The American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (the Act) provides for a special one-time elective dividends
received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S.
taxpayer equal to 85% of the eligible distribution. During the fourth quarter
of 2005, we repatriated $360 million, of which $172.5 million qualified for the
special one-time elective dividends received deduction and $187.5 million
constituted earnings that do not qualify under the Act, previously taxed income
and return of capital. We recorded tax expense of $11.2 million related to the
repatriation of $360 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, our chief
executive officer approved a domestic reinvestment plan (DRIP) to invest up to
$185 million in foreign earnings in qualified investments pursuant to the Act.
As required by the Act, the reinvestment plan was ratified by the Board of
Directors in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We satisfied the DRIP
reinvestment requirements during fiscal 2005.

Tax Reserves.

We
may establish reserves for tax contingencies based on the probable outcome of
tax positions taken for financial statement purposes compared to positions
taken on the tax returns. In fiscal 2005, we released tax contingency reserves
totaling $34.0 million related to previously acquired companies as a result of
expiration of the applicable statute of limitation. These released liabilities
were recorded against acquisition goodwill with no effect on our net loss in
fiscal 2005. We continuously review our tax contingency reserves to ensure that
they are appropriately stated. Such review includes consideration of tax
controversy factors such as periods covered by the cause of action, the degree
of probability of an unfavorable outcome, our ability to estimate the
liability, the timing of the liability and how it will impact our other tax
attributes. At October 31, 2005, we believe that we have adequately
provided for our tax-related liabilities.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Our sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may
be drawn down under our credit facility.

As of October 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments were $586.5 million, compared to $579.0 million as
of October 31, 2004.

Cash provided by operations is in part dependent upon
the payment terms on our license agreements. Payment terms for time-based
licenses are generally extended, with the license fee typically paid quarterly


in even increments over
the term of the license. Conversely, for an upfront license, customers pay a
substantial portion of the license fee within the first year. Accordingly, we
generally receive cash from time-based licenses, the primary component of our
business under our almost fully ratable license model, later than from upfront
licenses.

Cash provided by operations was $269.2 million for the
year ended October 31, 2005 compared to $264.0 million for the same period
in fiscal 2004. This increase largely resulted from (i) an increase in
deferred revenue of $62.8 million due to the change in our licenses from
upfront to time-based licenses during the last quarter of fiscal 2004; (ii) the  payment of $15.4 million for the MoSys
acquisition agreement termination fee and associated litigation made in fiscal
2004 but not in 2005; and (iii) lower disbursements for income taxes and
value added taxes paid of approximately $24.9 million and $7.5 million,
respectively. This increase was offset by: (i) increased disbursements of
$23.3 million associated with prepaid maintenance contracts for our information
technology infrastructure as compared to the prior fiscal year; and (ii) $49.2
million reduction in cash used to satisfy accounts payable in fiscal 2005.

Accounts receivable, net of allowances, decreased
$32.0 million, or 24%, to $100.2 million as of October 31, 2005 from
$132.3 million as of October 31, 2004. Days sales outstanding (DSO),
calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable
as of the balance sheet date, decreased to 36 days as of October 31, 2005
from 53 days as of October 31, 2004. The decrease in DSO and accounts
receivable is attributable to lower billings for the fiscal year due to greater
concentration of TSLs in our more ratable license model since cash is collected
over a longer period of time for TSLs than upfront licenses.

Cash provided by operations was $264.0 million in
fiscal 2004 compared to $391.5 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in
cash from operations was driven in part by lower orders and reported revenues
in fiscal 2004, as well as by increased use of operating cash as follows: (i) cash
disbursements for foreign income taxes of approximately $44.7 million; (ii) payment
of $15.4 million for the MoSys acquisition agreement termination fee and
associated litigation costs; (iii) disbursements associated with our
fiscal 2003 workforce realignment of approximately $14.9 million; (iv) payments
of international value added taxes of approximately $7.5 million; and (v) increased
prepaid maintenance contract expenses for our design and information systems
electronic infrastructure. These uses of cash were partially offset by income
tax refunds of $28.6 million.

Accounts receivable, net of allowances, decreased
$68.7 million, or 34%, to $132.3 million as of October 31, 2004
from $201.0 million as of October 31, 2003. Days sales outstanding
(DSO), calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts
receivable as of the balance sheet date, decreased to 53 days as of October 31,
2004 from 58 days as of October 31, 2003. The decrease in accounts
receivable and DSO was attributable to a $100.7 million reduction in new
billings caused by lower orders during fiscal 2004 and longer customer payment
terms compared to fiscal 2003, partially offset by a $39.0 million
decrease in collections compared to the prior fiscal year.

Cash used in investing activities was $171.5 million
for the year ended October 31, 2005 compared to $172.0 million for the
same period in fiscal 2004. Cash used in investing activities remained
relatively constant as we offset the increase of $114.4 million of cash used in
acquisitions by a corresponding reduction in cash used in net purchases of
short term and long term investments.

Cash used in investing activities was
$172.0 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $258.3 million in fiscal
2003. The decrease of $86.3 million is primarily due to a substantial
decrease of cash used for acquisitions and decreased proceeds from the sale of
long-term investments.

Cash used in financing activities was $39.8 million
for the year ended October 31, 2005 compared to $266.6 million provided by
financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $226.8 million in cash
used was due to a decrease of $334.9 million in cash used to repurchase shares
of our common stock in the open


market compared to the
year ended October 31, 2004 and decreased proceeds of $108.1 million from
the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock plans compared
to fiscal 2004.

Cash used in financing activities was
$266.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared to cash provided by financing
activities of $74.2 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease of
$340.8 million is primarily due to a decrease in proceeds of
$178.2 million from the sale of shares pursuant to our employee equity
incentive plans during fiscal 2004 and increased purchases of our common stock
in the open market of $162.6 million during fiscal 2004.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) provides
for a special one-time elective dividends received deduction on the
repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer equal to 85% of the
eligible distribution. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $360
million, of which $172.5 million qualified for the special one-time elective
dividends received deduction and $187.5 million constituted earnings that do
not qualify under the Act, previously taxed income and return of capital. We
recorded tax expense of $11.2 million related to the repatriation of $360
million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, our chief executive officer
approved a domestic reinvestment plan (DRIP) to invest up to $185 million in
foreign earnings in qualified investments pursuant to the Act. As required by
the Act, the reinvestment plan was ratified by the Board of Directors in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006. We satisfied the DRIP reinvestment requirements
during fiscal 2005.

We hold our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments in the United States and in foreign accounts, primarily in Ireland,
Bermuda, and Japan. As of October 31, 2005, we held an aggregate of $486.8
million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United
States and an aggregate of $99.7 million in foreign accounts. Funds in
foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside North America. With the
exception of Japan and the repatriated funds described above, we currently
maintain a policy under APB 23,

Accounting
for Income Taxes—Special Areas

, of permanently reinvesting such
funds outside of the United States.

In April 2004, we entered into a three-year
senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility contains financial
covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified
levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The facility
terminates on April 28, 2007. Borrowings under the facility bear interest
at the greater of the administrative agent’s prime rate or the Federal funds
rate plus 0.50%; however, we have the option to pay interest based on the
outstanding amount at Eurodollar rates plus a spread between 0.80% and 1.125%
based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment
fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.20% and 0.25% per annum
based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In April, 2004, we
borrowed and repaid $200 million under the credit facility. On May 3,
2005, we borrowed $75.0 million under this credit facility in connection with
the acquisition of Nassda. We repaid this amount in full as of May 27,
2005. As of October 31, 2005, we had no outstanding borrowings under this
credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants.

We believe that our
current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from
operations will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve
months.


Contractual
Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The
following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 31,
2005.

(1)

This commitment relates
to the fees associated with the revolving credit facility. Additional
information is provided in Note 5 of our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

(2)

Additional information
is provided in Note 6 of our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

(3)

Purchase obligations
represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations
in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or
services as of October 31, 2005. Although open purchase orders are
considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the
option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business
needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

(4)

Includes (a) approximately
$4.9 million in promissory notes payable in September 2007 issued in
connection with an acquisition in September 2002 and (b) a bond
payable in September 2023 to the city of San Jose for participating in a
development project for land owned by us. Additional information is provided in
Note 5 of our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.
Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as
unearned revenue, are not presented in this table because they do not require
cash settlement in the future.

We are committed to making an additional payment of
$2.1 million related to the bond payable in Note (4) above. In connection
with our acquisitions completed prior to October 31, 2005, we may be
obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $11.3 million in cash during the next 12
months and an additional $15.6 million in cash during the two years following
the next 12 months if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved in
full. Because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and
milestone goals being achieved in full, these amounts are not reflected in the
table above. We closed our acquisition of HPL Technologies, Inc. (HPL) on December 7,
2005 and are committed to make cash expenditures in fiscal 2006. See Note 14 of
our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. These
amounts are not reflected in the table above.

The expected timing of
payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current
information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different
depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon
amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone-based
obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of
the contingent events and can vary significantly.

Pre-approvals
of Non-Audit Services by Audit Committee

Pursuant to Section 10A(i)(3) of
the Exchange Act, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Audit Committee
pre-approved the following non-audit services to be performed by KPMG LLP, our
independent auditors:

1.

International tax

tax services relating to the repatriation of cash pursuant to the American Jobs
Creation Act of  2004.

Factors
That May Affect Future Results

Our reported results of operations will be materially
and adversely affected by our adoption of SFAS 123R.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), which will be effective in our first quarter of fiscal
2006,will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense
relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans. We
currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for
stock-based awards to our employees. Under this standard, we generally have not
recognized any compensation expense related to stock option grants we issue
under our stock option plans or the discounts we provide under our employee
stock purchase plans. Under the new rules, we will be required to adopt a fair
value-based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee
stock awards, which will lead to substantial additional compensation expense
and will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.

Note 2

to

Consolidated Financial
Statements

in this report provides our pro forma net income and
earnings per share as if we had used a fair value-based method similar to the
methods required under SFAS 123R to measure the compensation expense for
employee stock awards during the periods presented.

Weakness, budgetary caution or consolidation in the
semiconductor and electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our
business.

We believe that EDA industry growth has been adversely
affected by many factors, including ongoing efforts by semiconductor companies
to control their spending, uncertainty regarding the long term growth rate of
the semiconductor industry, excess EDA tool capacity at many customers and
increased competition in the EDA industry itself. If these factors persist or
semiconductor industry growth does not occur (or if we do not benefit from any
such increases), our business, operating results and financial condition will
be materially and adversely affected.

We also believe that, over the long term, growth in
EDA spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor R&D
spending and continued growth in the overall semiconductor market. However, we


cannot predict the timing
or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues, R&D spending or spending
on EDA products, nor whether we will benefit from any such increases should
they occur. For example, although the semiconductor industry grew by 18% in
2003 and 29% in 2004 and we estimate that R&D spending among large
semiconductor companies increased approximately 10% from 2003 to 2004, EDA
industry revenue during this period did not track these growth levels.

Competition in the EDA industry may have a material
adverse effect on our business and operating results.

We compete with other EDA vendors that offer a broad
range of products and services, primarily Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
Mentor Graphics Corporation, and with EDA vendors that offer products focused
on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process, such as Magma Design
Automation, Inc, We also compete with customers’ internally developed
design tools and capabilities. If we fail to compete effectively, our business
will be materially and adversely affected.

We compete
principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including
ease-of-use), time-to-results, post-sale support, interoperability with our own
and other vendors’ products, price and payment terms. Additional competitive
challenges include the following:

·

Customers
require a mix of price and tool performance that suits their needs; in some
cases this may lead them to choose vendors based on price more than
performance. In certain situations we may offer substantial discounts on our
products to meet pricing set by the competition. If, as we expect, customers
begin to consolidate their purchases with fewer vendors, some EDA suppliers may
pursue a deep discount strategy. As a result, prices for our products may
decline and/or we may lose potential business to lower price competitors. In
either case, our business, operating results and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

·

Technology
in the EDA industry evolves rapidly. Accordingly, we must correctly anticipate
and lead critical developments, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our
existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products. If we fail
to do so, our business will be materially and adversely affected.

·

To
compete effectively, we believe we must offer products that provide both a high
level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of
individual product performance. Doing both requires significant engineering and
development work. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue
offering complete design flows in configurations our customers will find more
attractive than our competitors’ offerings or that our efforts to balance the
interests of integration versus individual product performance will be
successful.

·

Our
major initiatives face intense competition and in some cases address emerging
markets. We have invested significant resources into further development of our
Galaxy Design Platform, integration of our Discovery Verification Platform and
enhancement of its System Verilog and other advanced features and development
of our Design for Manufacturing and IP portfolios, and have acquired companies
that focus on these areas. It is difficult for us to predict the success of
these initiatives and acquisitions. If we fail to expand revenue from our new
initiatives at the desired rate, our business, results of operations and
financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.

·

Payment
terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated
by our customers. During the second half of fiscal 2003 and continuing through
2004 and 2005, payment terms on time-based licenses lengthened compared to
prior periods, negatively affecting our cash flow from operations.


The decline in new IC design starts, industry
consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may adversely affect the
EDA industry, including demand for our products and services.

The increasing
complexity of SoCs and ICs, and customers’ concerns about managing cost and
risk have also led to the following potentially long-term negative trends:

·

The
number of starts of new IC designs has declined since 2000. New IC design
starts are a key driver of demand for EDA software.

·

A
number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have
occurred, and more are likely. Mergers can reduce the aggregate level of
purchases of EDA software and services, and in some cases, increase customers’
bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including Synopsys.

·

Due
to factors such as increased globalization, cost controls among customers
appear to have become more permanent, adversely impacting our customers’ EDA
spending.

·

Industry
changes, plus the cost and complexity of IC design, may be leading some
companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general, to
focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other
aspects of the design, or using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), an
alternative chip technology.

These trends, if sustained, could have a material
adverse effect on the EDA industry, including the demand for our products and
services, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

We have received a Revenue Agent’s Report from the
Internal Revenue Service claiming a significant increase in our U.S. taxable
income. An adverse outcome of this examination or any future examinations
involving similar claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

Our operations are subject to income and transaction
taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions and to review
or audit by IRS and state, local and foreign tax authorities. In connection
with an IRS audit of our United States federal income tax returns for fiscal
years 2000 and 2001, on May 31, 2005 we received a Notice of Proposed
Adjustment in which the IRS claimed a very large increase to our U.S. taxable
income. On June 8, 2005, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report in which the
IRS proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of
approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. This proposed adjustment primarily
relates to transfer pricing transactions between Synopsys and a wholly-owned
foreign subsidiary. We have filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the
IRS, which will cause the matter to be referred to the Appeals Office of the
IRS. Resolution of this matter could take a considerable time, possibly years.

We strongly believe the proposed IRS adjustments and
resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and
that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals. Accordingly, we will
continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. While we believe
the IRS’ asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law, we believe
it is probable we will be required to make additional payments in order to
resolve this matter. However, based on our analysis to date, we believe we have
adequately provided for this matter. If we are required to pay a significant
amount of additional U.S. taxes and applicable interest in excess of our
provision for this matter, our results of operations and financial condition
would be materially and adversely affected.


The failure to meet the semiconductor industry’s
demands for advancing EDA technology and continued cost reductions may
adversely affect our financial result

s.

SoC and IC functionality continues to increase while
feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk
of IC design and manufacturing. To address greater complexity, semiconductor
designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from EDA suppliers. At
the same time, as a result of pricing pressure on their own products, we
believe customers and potential customers are also seeking to buy more products
from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce
overall cost and risk. In order to succeed in this environment, we must
successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements, while also striving
to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. Failure to manage
these conflicting demands successfully would materially and adversely affect
our financial condition and results of operations.

Our revenue and
earnings fluctuate, which could cause our financial results to not meet
expectations and our stock price to decline.

M

any factors affect
our revenue and earnings, including customer demand, license mix, the timing of
revenue recognition on products and services sold and committed expense levels,
making it difficult to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal
period. Accordingly, stockholders should not view our historical results as
necessarily indicative of our future performance. If our financial results or
targets do not meet investor and analyst expectations, our stock price could
decline.

Some of the
specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular
quarter or over several fiscal periods include, but are not limited to:

·

We
base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and
generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized.
Since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue
shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income.

·

Beginning
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we shifted our target license mix to
consist almost entirely of time-based licenses. Time-based licenses yield
significantly less current period revenue and more future period revenue than
upfront licenses. The license mix shift decreased revenue and earnings for
fiscal 2005.

·

Our
revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain
level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time-based licenses. The
amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the
level of overall license orders, customer demand, preferred customer payment
terms and requested customer ship dates could have a material adverse effect on
our revenue and earnings. For example, if we ship more upfront licenses than
expected during any given fiscal period, our revenue and earnings for that period
could be above our targets even if orders are below target; conversely, if we
ship fewer upfront licenses than expected our revenue and earnings for that
period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our
target. Similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of TBL orders
during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be negatively
affected.

·

We may be required to implement a number of
cost control measures in order to meet our externally-communicated financial
targets, any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or
could adversely affect our business.

·

The
market for EDA products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including
consumer demand for our customers’ products, customer R&D and EDA tool
budgets, pricing, our competitors’ product offerings and customer design starts.
It is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on
our customer’s demand for our products on a medium or long term basis. As a result,
actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts


which, in turn could cause
our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly-disclosed
targets.

·

Certain
of our upfront and time-based license agreements provide the right to re-mix a
portion of the software initially subject to the license for other Synopsys
products. For example, a customer may use our front-end design products for a
portion of the term of its license and then re-mix such products for back-end placement
software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s IC
design. While this practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete
design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of these arrangements could
result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools
separately.

·

In
the past, we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for
a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. The delay of one
or more orders, particularly an upfront order, could have a material adverse
effect on our bookings, revenue and earnings for that quarter.

·

Our
customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either
alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision.
Accordingly, our customers’ evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our
fiscal quarters. Further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if
customers delay project approval or project starts because of budgetary
constraints or their budget cycles.

Businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in
the future may not perform as we project.

We have acquired a number of companies or their assets
in recent years, including four in fiscal 2005, six transactions during fiscal
2004 and three transactions in fiscal 2003, and, as part of our efforts to
expand our product and services offerings, we expect to acquire additional
companies in the future.

In addition to
direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including:

·

Potential
dilution of our earnings per share;

·

Problems
in integrating the acquired products with our products;

·

Difficulties
in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company;

·

Challenges
in ensuring acquired products meet our quality standards;

·

Failure
to realize expected synergies or cost savings;

·

Failure
of acquired products to achieve projected sales;

·

Drain
on management time for acquisition-related activities;

·

Delays
caused by regulatory scrutiny;

·

Adverse
effects on customer buying patterns or relationships; and

·

Assumption
of unknown liabilities.

While we review
proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are
favorable to us, we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will
positively affect our future performance. Furthermore, if we later determine we
cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we could be required to
write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated with such product or
technology; these write-downs, if significant, could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations.

A failure to timely recruit and retain key employees
would have a material adverse effect on our business.

To be successful, we must attract and retain key
technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join Synopsys in
connection with acquisitions. There are a limited number of qualified EDA and


IC design engineers, and
competition for these individuals is intense. Our employees are often recruited
aggressively by our competitors and our customers. Any failure to recruit and
retain key technical, sales and managerial employees would have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We issue stock options and maintain employee stock
purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. There is growing
pressure on public companies from stockholders, who must approve any increases
in our stock option pool, generally to reduce our overhang or amount of
outstanding and unexercised stock options. In addition, the implementation of
new accounting rules that require us to recognize on our income statement
compensation expense from employee stock options and our employee stock
purchase plan beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2006, which we expect
will increase pressure to limit future option grants. These factors may make it
more difficult for Synopsys to grant attractive equity-based packages in the
future, which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key
employees.

Stagnation of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate
fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could
adversely affect our performance.

During fiscal 2005 and 2004, we derived 49% and 45%,
respectively, of our revenue from outside the United States; going forward, we
expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on
substantial contributions from outside the United States. Foreign sales are
vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions,
including the effects of international political conflict, hostilities and
natural disasters. Further, any stagnation of foreign economies could adversely
affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside
the United States.

Our operating results are also affected by
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations can
be adversely affected when the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other
currencies, including the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar, as a
result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in
foreign currencies into the dollar. Exchange rates are subject to significant
and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact
of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. While we hedge certain foreign currency exposures of our
business, we can provide no assurance that our hedging transactions will be
effective.

In addition, we have expanded our non-U.S. operations
significantly in the past several years. While the increased international
presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions locally and
higher international sales, this strategy also requires us to recruit and
retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote
locations performing complex software development projects and ensure
intellectual property protection outside of the United States. The failure to
effectively manage our global operations would have a material adverse effect
on our business and results of operations.

Customer payment defaults could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.

Our backlog consists principally of customer payment
obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already
delivered. These customer obligations are typically not cancelable, but will
not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults and fails
to pay amounts owed. In these cases, we will generally take legal action to
recover amounts owed. Moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate
pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own
businesses. Though we have not, to date, experienced a material level of
defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant
reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


A failure to protect our proprietary technology would
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Our success depends in part upon protecting our
proprietary technology. To protect this technology, we rely on agreements with
customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide. We
can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we
would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not
otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. Moreover,
certain foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection
for intellectual property; our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our
products in those countries is therefore limited. We have a policy of
aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully
appropriate or use our products and technologies. However, there can be no
assurance that these actions will be successful. If we do not obtain or maintain
appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or
cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions,
our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially
and adversely affected. In addition, intellectual property litigation is
lengthy and expensive and legal fees related to such litigation may reduce our
net income.

From time to time we are subject to claims that our
products infringe on third party intellectual property rights.

Under our customer agreements and other license
agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products
infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights. As a result, we are
from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third
party rights. For example, we are currently defending some of our customers
against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held
by a Japanese electronics company. We believe this claim is without merit and
will continue to vigorously pursue this defense.

These types of claims can, however, result in costly
and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements,
subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, require
us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or
require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could
materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

We are subject to changes in financial accounting
standards, which may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way
we conduct business.

Accounting policies affecting software revenue
recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations, significantly
affecting the way we license our products. Future changes in financial
accounting standards, including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition,
may have a significant effect on our reported results, including reporting of
transactions completed before the effective date of the changes.

Our business is subject to evolving corporate
governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs
and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock
price.

Because our common stock is publicly traded on the
Nasdaq stock market, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated
by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the
SEC, Nasdaq and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which monitors
the accounting practices of public companies. Many of these regulations have
only recently been enacted, and continue to evolve, making compliance more
difficult and uncertain. In addition, our efforts to comply with these new
regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in,
increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management
time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.


In particular, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment
of our internal controls over financial reporting and auditor attestation of
that assessment in our annual reports. This effort has required, and will continue
to require in the future, the commitment of significant financial and
managerial resources. This annual report on Form 10-K discloses a
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. Although we
believe that our ongoing review of our internal controls will enable us to
provide favorable assessments of our internal controls and for our external
auditors to provide their annual attestations in future SEC filings, as
required by Section 404, we can give no assurance that these efforts will
be completed on a timely and successful basis. Any failure to complete a
favorable assessment and obtain our auditors’ attestation could have a material
adverse effect on our stock price.

Product errors or defects could expose us to liability
and harm our reputation.

Despite extensive testing prior to releasing our
products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially
when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with
technologies developed by acquired companies. Product errors could affect the
performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or
release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect
market acceptance or perception of our products. In addition, allegations of IC
manufacturability issues resulting from use of our IP products could, even if
untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to
license IP products from us. Any such errors or delays in releasing new
products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory
performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our
service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources
from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.


Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
Rate Risk.

Our
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our
short-term investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment
activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing
yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we
maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of
tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as
specified in our investment policy. None of our investments are held for
trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one issue, issuer and type of instrument.

The
following table presents the carrying value and related weighted-average
total return for our investment portfolio as of October 31, 2005:

As of October 31, 2005, the stated maturities of
our current short-term investments are $41.6 million within one year,
$20.8 million within one to five years, $10.8 million within five to
ten years and $108.9 million after ten years. However, we consider these
investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance with our
investment policy, the weighted-average expected duration of our total invested
funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term
obligations and other uses including acquisitions. These investments are
recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or
losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of tax.

The
following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as
of October 31, 2005 that are subject to interest rate risk by calendar
year of expected duration and average interest rates:


In
comparison, the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents
and investments as of October 31, 2004 that were subject to interest rate
risk by calendar year of expected duration and average interest rates:

In April 2004, Synopsys entered into a
three-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This
facility contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain a minimum
leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial
covenants. The facility terminates on April 28, 2007. Borrowings under the
facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent’s prime rate
or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, we have the option to pay
interest based on the outstanding amount at Eurodollar rates plus a spread
between 0.80% and 1.125% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant.
In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.20%
and 0.25% per annum based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In April 2004
and May 2005, we borrowed and repaid $200.0 and $75.0 million, respectively,
under the credit facility. As of October 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no
outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with
all covenants.

Foreign
Currency Risk.

The functional currency of each
of Synopsys’ active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local
currency, except for our principal Irish and Swiss subsidiaries whose
functional currencies are the U.S. dollar. We engage in a program to
minimize the effect of changes in the exchange rate between a given functional
currency (i.e. the yen in the case of 
our Japanese subsidiary) and the corresponding non-functional currency
transactions (i.e. receivables denominated in the U.S. dollar in the case of
our Japanese subsidiary). We hedge the following types of
non-functional-currency-denominated balances and transactions: (i) certain
assets and liabilities, (ii) shipments forecasted to occur within
approximately one month, (iii) future billings and revenue on previously
shipped orders, and (iv) certain future intercompany invoices denominated
in the Euro. A description of the accounting under our hedging programs is
included in Note 2 to our

Notes to

Consolidated Financial Statements

.


The
following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of
October 31, 2005:

The
following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of
October 31, 2004:

The amounts shown in the tables include the balances
and transactions described above. The maximum original duration of the currency
contracts shown is 16 months in the case of our Euro forward contracts and one
month in the case of contracts for other currencies. Due to the short

-

term nature of these contracts, the contract rates
approximate fair value as of October 31, 2005 and 2004.

The success of our hedging activities depends upon the
accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in
non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and
losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses
and gains on the underlying transactions.

For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10%
prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table
above, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $6.0
million, and we would be required to pay approximately $6.0 million to the
counterparty upon contract


maturity. At the same
time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting
in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $6.0 million that would
offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.

Net unrealized loss of approximately $0.6 million and
gain of $9.6 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet as of October 31,
2005 and October 31, 2004, respectively. Net cash outflows on maturing
forward contracts during the three months ended October 31, 2005 were $2.9
million.

If our estimates of our balances and transactions
prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain
or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Synopsys
reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of SFAS 133,
resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to
certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error
was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of
Synopsys’ hedging program. To correct the error, Synopsys reclassified the
remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other
comprehensive income to other income in the three months ended January 31,
2005.

Foreign currency contracts entered into in connection
with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be
unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We have limited these agreements to
major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk. Furthermore, we
monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution. We do
not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes.

Equity
Risk.

Our
strategic investment portfolio as of October 31, 2005 consists of
approximately $8.0 million of minority equity investments in publicly
traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately
$12.8 million as of October 31, 2004. The securities of publicly
traded companies are generally classified as available-for-sale securities
accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,

and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or
losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are
reported at the lower of cost or fair value. During fiscal 2005 and 2004, we
reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $4.5 million and
$3.5 million, respectively.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Synopsys, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended October 31, 2005. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended October 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting of Synopsys, Inc. as of October 31, 2005,
based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated January
12, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and an
adverse opinion on the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

Note 2.   Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal
Year End.

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest October 31. All fiscal
years presented were 52-week years. For presentation purposes, the
consolidated financial statements and notes refer to the calendar month end.

Principles
of Consolidation.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all
of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.

Stock
Split.

On
September 23, 2003, the Company completed a two-for-one stock split in the
form of a stock dividend. All common share and per share data for all periods
presented have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.

Basis
of Presentation:

Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In the first
quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company revised its methodology for allocating and
reporting cost of revenue. The Company has classified cost of revenue of fiscal
2003 and 2004 to conform to the fiscal 2005 methodology.

Foreign
Currency Translation.

The
functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the
foreign subsidiary’s local currency except for the Company’s principal Irish
and Swiss subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the United States (U.S.)
dollar. Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional
currency are remeasured into the functional currency with any related gain or
loss recorded in earnings. Such gains or losses have not been material for any
period presented. The Company translates assets and liabilities of its foreign
operations except its principal Irish and Swiss subsidiaries into the
functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The
Company translates income and expense items of its foreign operations into U.S.
dollars at average exchange rates for the period. Accumulated net translation
adjustments are reported in stockholders’ equity, net of tax, as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Use
of Estimates.

To
prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles accepted in the United States of America, management must make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Fair
Values of Financial Instruments.

The fair value of the Company’s
cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and foreign
currency contracts, approximates the carrying amount, due to their short weighted
average maturities. Long-term marketable equity investments are valued based on
quoted market prices. Non-marketable equity securities are valued at cost. The
Company performs periodic impairment analysis over these non-marketable equity
securities.


Cash
Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.

The Company classifies investments
with original maturities of three months or less when acquired as cash
equivalents. All of the Company’s cash equivalents and short-term investments
are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Those unrealized
gains or losses deemed other than temporary are reflected in investment income,
net. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method
and realized gains and losses are included in other income, net. The Company
has cash equivalents and investments with various high quality institutions
and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution.

Concentration
of Credit Risk.

The
Company sells its products worldwide primarily to customers in the global
electronics market. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition and does not require collateral. The Company
establishes reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been
within management’s expectations and have not been material in any year
presented.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts.

Trade accounts receivable are recorded
at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. We maintain allowances for
doubtful accounts to reduce the Company’s receivables to their estimated net
realizable value. The Company provides a general reserve on all accounts
receivable based on a review of accounts and a 15 quarter average of write
offs, net of recoveries. Such losses have been within management’s expectations
and have not been material in any year presented. The following table provides
a rollforward of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Income
Taxes.

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS 109). Under the asset
and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is recorded
at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Assets are depreciated
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from
three to five years and not to exceed 30 years for buildings. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining
term of the lease or the economic useful life of the asset, whichever is
shorter. Amortization and depreciation expense was $52.7 million in 2005, $53.0
million in 2004 and $52.9 million in 2003. The cost of repairs and maintenance
is charged to operations as incurred and was $17.4 million, $16.1 million
and $15.1 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company
evaluates the recoverability of its property, equipment and intangible assets
on at least an annual basis in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the


Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(SFAS 144), and record
an impairment charge against income as appropriate. A detail of property and
equipment is as follows:

Software
Development Costs.

Capitalization
of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility, which is generally the completion of a working prototype and ends
upon general release of the product. Capitalized software development costs
were approximately $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.6 million in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization of software development costs
is computed based on the straight-line method over the software’s estimated
economic life of approximately two years. The Company recorded software
amortization costs of $2.7 million, $2.3 million and
$1.6 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Goodwill,
Intangible Assets and Deferred Stock Compensation.

Goodwill represents the excess of
the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired by the Company. The goodwill recorded
as a result of the business combinations in the years presented is not deductible
for tax purposes. The Company evaluates aggregate goodwill on a quarterly basis
for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by its market
capitalization in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
(SFAS 142),

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. If this evaluation indicates that the value of
the goodwill may be impaired, the Company assesses the impairment of the
goodwill using the two-step method prescribed by SFAS 142. Any such
impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s reported financial statements. The Company did not record any
impairment charges on its goodwill during fiscal 2005. As of October 31,
2005, the carrying amount of our goodwill was $729.0 million.

Intangible assets consist of purchased technology,
contract rights intangibles, customer installed base/relationships, trademarks
and tradenames, covenants not to compete, customer backlog, capitalized
software and other intangibles. Intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from two to
ten years. Amortization of intangible assets was $116.1 million,
$136.4 million and $124.8 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company evaluates its intangible assets for indications of
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. If this evaluation indicates that the
value of the intangible asset may be impaired, the Company makes an assessment
of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining
useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not
recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the
technology over the remaining amortization period, the Company reduces the net
carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the
remaining amortization period.

Deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic
value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with acquisitions as well
as the value of restricted stock issued to members of the Board of Directors.
The deferred stock compensation is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
remaining


vesting period of one to
four years. Amortization of deferred stock compensation net of forfeitures
was approximately $2.0 million, $3.4 million, and $5.0 million in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Accounts Payable and Accrued
Liabilities.

Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities consist of:

Deferred
Compensation Plan.

The
Company maintains the Synopsys Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”), which
permits certain employees to defer up to 50% of their annual cash base
compensation and up to 100% of their annual cash variable compensation.
Distributions from the Plan are generally payable upon cessation of employment
over five to 15 years or as a lump sum payment at the option of the
employee. Since the inception of the Plan, the Company has not made any
matching or discretionary contributions to the Plan. There are no Plan
provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on investments.
Undistributed amounts under the Plan are subject to the claims of the Company’s
creditors. As of October 31, 2005 and 2004, the invested amounts under the
Plan total $54.0 million and $41.8 million, respectively, and are
recorded as long-term other assets on the Company’s balance sheet. As of October 31,
2005 and 2004, the Company has recorded $56.5 million and
$44.2 million, respectively, as a long-term liability to recognize
undistributed amounts due to employees.

Synopsys
401(k) Plan.

The
Company maintains various retirement plans for its eligible U.S. and non-U.S.
employees. Total contributions to these plans are charged to operations and
were $10.2 million, $8.4 million and $6.6 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. For employees in the U.S., the Company maintains the
Synopsys 401(k) Savings and Success Sharing Plan (the “401k Plan”). As
allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 401k Plan
allows tax deferred salary deductions by eligible employees. The Company’s
Deferred Compensation Plans Committee administers the 401k Plan. Participants
in the 401k Plan may make salary deferrals of up to 30% of eligible annual
salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue
Code. The Company makes a matching contribution equal to 40% of employee
deferrals, up to a maximum of $1,500 per participant per year. Effective January 1,
2003, participants who have reached the age of fifty before the close of the
401k Plan year may be eligible to make catch-up salary deferral contributions,
limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. Catch-up
contributions are not eligible for matching contributions.

Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The Company records comprehensive income in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income (Loss)

,
which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income (loss)
and its components in the financial statements. Comprehensive income (loss), as
defined, includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources,
such as accumulated net translation adjustments, unrealized gains on certain
foreign currency forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges and
reclassification adjustments related to unrealized gains on investments.
Reclassification adjustments decrease other comprehensive income for gains on
the sale of available-for-sale securities realized during the current year and
are included in other comprehensive income (loss) as unrealized holding gains
in the period in which such unrealized gains arose.


Accumulated
other comprehensive (loss) income consists of the following:

Revenue
Recognition.

The
Company

recognizes revenue from software licenses and maintenance and
service revenue. Software license revenue includes fees associated with the
licensing of the Company’s software. Maintenance and service revenue includes
maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional
service fees.

The Company has designed and implemented revenue
recognition policies in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, as
amended by SOP 98-9,

Modification of
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions.

With respect to
software licenses, the Company utilizes license types:

·

Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs)

are for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to
receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for,
unspecified future technology. The Company bundles and does not charge
separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance or PCS) for the term
of the license.

·

Term licenses

are also for a finite
term, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange
licensed software for unspecified future technology. Customers purchase
maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the
balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a
percentage of the net license fee.

·

Perpetual licenses

continue as long as the customer renews maintenance, plus an additional
20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to
receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology.
Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew
annually.

For the three
software license types, the Company recognizes revenue as follows:

·

Technology Subscription Licenses

.   The
Company typically recognizes revenue from TSL license fees (which include
bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period. However,
where extended payment terms (i.e. where less than 75% of the TSL license fees
are due within one year from shipment) are offered under the license
arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue from TSL license fees in an amount
equal to the lesser of the ratable portion of the entire fee or customer
installments as they become due and payable.

·

Term Licenses

.   The Company
recognizes the term license fee in full if, upon shipment of the software,
payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the term license fee
within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are
met. For term licenses where less than 75% of the term license fee is due
within one year from shipment, the Company recognizes revenue as customer
installments become due and payable.

·

Perpetual Licenses

.   The
Company recognizes the perpetual license fee in full if, upon shipment of the
software, payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the
perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue
recognition criteria are met. For perpetual


licenses in which less
than 75% of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment, the
Company recognizes the revenue as customer installments become due and payable.

The Company allocates revenue on software transactions
(referred to as “arrangements”) involving multiple elements to each element
based on the relative fair values of the elements. The Company’s determination
of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on
vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). The Company limits its
assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element
is sold separately.

The Company has analyzed all of the elements included
in its multiple-element arrangements and has determined that it has
sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of its
perpetual and term license products and to consulting. Accordingly, assuming
all other revenue recognition criteria are met, the Company recognizes revenue
from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method in
accordance with SOP 98-9, the Company recognizes revenue from maintenance
ratably over the maintenance term and the Company recognizes revenue from
consulting services as the related services are performed and accepted.

The Company makes
significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in
connection with each transaction involving its products, the Company must
evaluate whether: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery
has occurred, (iii) its fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility
is probable. The Company applies these criteria as discussed below.

·

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists

.   Prior
to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, the Company’s customary practice is
to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and the Company, or a
purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard
end-user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement.

·

Delivery Has Occurred

.   The
Company delivers software to its customers physically or electronically. For
physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping
point. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when the Company provides the
customer access codes, or “keys,” that allow the customer to take immediate
possession of the software on its hardware.

·

The Fee is Fixed or Determinable

.   The
Company’s determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable
depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. The Company’s standard
payment terms require 75% or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one
year. Where these terms apply, the Company regards the fee as fixed or
determinable, and the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery (assuming all
other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the payment terms do not meet
this standard, which the Company refers to as “extended payment terms,” the
Company does not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally
recognizes revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case
of a TSL, the Company recognizes revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or
determinable, due to the fact that maintenance services are included with the
software licenses and due to application of other revenue accounting guidelines
relating to arrangements that include rights to receive unspecified future
technology.

·

Collectibility is Probable

.   To
recognize revenue, the Company must judge collectibility of the arrangement
fees, which it does on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to its credit
review policy. The Company typically sells to customers with whom it has a
history of successful collection. For a new customer or where an existing
customer substantially expands its commitments to us, the Company evaluates the
customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assigns a credit
limit based on that review. The Company increases the credit limit only after
it has established a successful collection history with the customer. If the
Company determines at any time that collectibility is not probable based upon
its credit review process or the customer’s payment history, the Company
recognizes revenue on a cash-collected basis.


The Company
recognizes maintenance and service revenue as follows:

·

Maintenance Fees Associated with Perpetual and Term
Licenses

.   The Company recognizes revenue from
maintenance associated with perpetual and term licenses ratably over the
maintenance term.

·

Professional Service Fees

.   The
Company recognizes revenue from consulting and training services as services
are performed and accepted.

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share.

The Company computes basic net income (loss) per
share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. The Company computes diluted net income (loss) per share
using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive stock
options outstanding during the period; the number of weighted-average
dilutive stock options outstanding is computed using the treasury stock method.
Due to the net loss incurred for fiscal 2005, the effect of employee stock
options is anti-dilutive in that period.

The
table below reconciles the weighted-average common shares used to
calculate basic net income per share with the weighted-average common
shares used to calculate diluted net income per share.

The effect of dilutive employee stock options excludes
approximately 27.1 million, 10.8 million and 12.0 million stock
options for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which were anti-dilutive for
net income per share calculations. No stock options were considered dilutive
for the fiscal year ended 2005 as a result of the Company’s net loss for the
period. Although these options are currently not included in the net income
(loss) per share calculation, they could be dilutive when the Company reports
future earnings.

Stock-Based
Compensation.

As permitted by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
the Company has elected to use the intrinsic value method prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to employees.
Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes no compensation expense with
respect to stock-based awards to employees as awards are issued with
exercise prices equal to the fair value of the common stock on the grant date.
The Company has determined pro forma information regarding net income and net
income (loss) per share as if the Company had accounted for employee stock
awards under the fair value method as required by SFAS No. 123, as
amended. The Company has revised its fiscal year 2004 SFAS 123 pro forma stock
compensation disclosure based on the discovery of an error in accounting for a
modification of its ESPP awards. The error resulted in a $4.7 million
increase to the stock compensation expense determined under the fair value
based method, and a respective increase to proforma net loss in fiscal 2004. The
fair value of these stock-based awards to employees was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model,


assuming no expected dividends and using the following
weighted-average assumptions:

For
pro forma purposes, the estimated fair value of the Company’s stock-based
awards to employees is amortized over the options’ vesting period of four years
and the ESPP’s two-year offering period. The Company’s pro forma net income and
net (loss) income per share data under SFAS No. 123 are as follows:

Foreign
Currency Contracts.

The
Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse
movements in currency exchange rates. The Company enters into foreign currency
forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on
non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and certain balance
sheet positions. These foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value on
the balance sheet in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and are
denominated primarily in the Euro and the Japanese yen.

Foreign currency forward contracts related to certain
balance sheet positions, primarily non-functional currency denominated assets
(such as accounts receivable) and liabilities (such as accounts payable),
generally have a duration of approximately one month. Gains and losses from the
forward contracts and the associated premium/discount are recorded each period
in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign currency forward contracts related to
forecasted non-functional currency denominated transactions, including shipments
forecast to occur within approximately one-month, billings and future revenue
on previously shipped orders and forecasts of certain intercompany expenses,
are designated as


cash flow hedges under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended (SFAS 133), with gains and
losses recorded net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity and reclassified into revenue or operating expense,
depending upon the type of transaction hedged, at the time the forecasted
transactions affect net income (loss). The maximum original duration of foreign
currency forward contracts is 16 months in the case of Euro forward contracts
and the maximum original duration for forward contracts of other currencies is
approximately one month. Rolling one month contracts are used to hedge
exposures of up to approximately 2.7 years.

To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging
relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge and the
hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on
hedged transactions. The Company evaluates hedging effectiveness prospectively
and retrospectively and records gains and losses from the measurement of hedging
ineffectiveness and the premium and discount on foreign currency forward
contracts, not included in the effectiveness evaluation or measurement of
ineffectiveness, in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of
operations. If a hedged transaction is deemed no longer to be probable of
occurring, the related hedge gains and losses are reclassified into net income
(loss) in the current period. No gains and losses were reclassified into net
income (loss) during the years ended October 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003 as a
result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to the underlying
transactions becoming not probable of occurring.

The net gain (loss) recognized in other income
(expense) for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was an
insignificant amount in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003.

The net discount received (or premium paid) recognized
in other income (expense) for cash flow hedges was $(1.5) million, $0, and $2.2
million in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003.

The Company estimates that as of October 31,
2005, $0.4 million of existing gain/(loss) will be reclassified from other
comprehensive income (loss) into net income (loss) within the next 12 months.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company
reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of SFAS 133, resulting in
the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior
year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error was not
material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of the Company’s
hedging program. To correct the error, the Company reclassified the remaining
$3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) to other income in the three months ended January 31, 2005.
The net income (loss) impact of gains and losses on foreign currency forward
contracts, net of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, was
immaterial for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Warranties.

The Company typically warrants its
products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to
material specifications for a period of 90 days. The Company also
indemnifies its customers from third party claims of intellectual property
infringement relating to the use of its products and is currently defending
some of its customers against claims that their use of one of its products
infringes a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. The Company is
unable to estimate the potential impact of these guarantees on the future
results of operations. To date, the Company has not been required to pay any
material warranty claims.


Note 3.

Business
Combinations and Divestitures

Purchase Combinations.

During
the fiscal years presented, the Company made a number of purchase acquisitions.
For each acquisition, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated value
of the net tangible assets acquired was allocated to various intangible assets,
consisting primarily of developed technology, customer- and contract-related
assets, other intangible assets and goodwill. The values assigned to developed
technologies related to each acquisition were based upon future discounted cash
flows related to the existing products’ projected income streams. The amounts
allocated to purchased in-process research and developments were determined
through established valuation techniques in the high-technology industry and
were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been
established and no future alternative uses existed. The Company evaluates
aggregate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on its
fair value as determined by its market capitalization in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(SFAS 142). If this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill
may be impaired, the Company assesses the impairment of the goodwill using the
two-step method prescribed by SFAS 142. Any such impairment charge could
be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
reported financial statements. The Company did not record any impairment
charges on its goodwill during fiscal 2005. As of October 31, 2005, the
carrying amount of the Company’s goodwill was $729.0 million.

Pro forma results of
operations are presented only for material acquisitions. The consolidated
financial statements include the operating results of each business from the
date of acquisition.

Fiscal 2005
Acquisitions

Acquisition
of Nassda Corporation (Nassda)

The Company acquired Nassda on May 11, 2005.

Reasons
for the Acquisition.

The Company believed

Nassda’s full-chip circuit
simulation and analysis software would broaden its offerings of
transistor-level circuit simulation tools, particularly in the area of
mixed-signal and memory design. The Company does not consider the Nassda
acquisition material to its results of operations and therefore is not
presenting pro forma statements of operations for the period ended October 31,
2005.

Purchase
Price.

The
Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Nassda for total cash
consideration of $200.2 million, or $7.00 per share. In addition, as required
by the merger agreement, certain Nassda officers, directors and employees who
were defendants in certain preexisting litigation between Synopsys and Nassda
made settlement payments to Synopsys in the aggregate amount of $61.6 million.

Net of the settlement payments described above, the
Company paid $138.6 million in cash to the former shareholders of Nassda. However,
in accordance with

EITF 04-01, Accounting
for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination,

the Company must separately value the settlement of the previously existing
Nassda litigation and the business combination. Therefore, the Company
determined the fair value of the settlement to be $33 million. The Company
recorded this amount as other non-operating income. The Company valued the net
assets acquired from Nassda in the business combination at $196.9 million. The
total purchase price includes $13.2 million in acquisition-related costs and
$12.1 million in vested stock options assumed. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Company reduced the estimate of acquisition-related costs and
the corresponding goodwill by $4.8 million based on terminated distributor
agreements being settled without termination payments as originally
anticipated.


Acquisition-related costs of $13.2 million consist
primarily of professional service fees of $11.0 million, which include legal,
tax and accounting fees; a $1.8 million class action settlement which was
required to be settled prior to the closing of the acquisition, plus $0.5
million in associated legal costs; approximately $1.0 million in severance
costs for employee termination, and other directly related charges. As of October 31,
2005, the Company had paid $9.7 million of the acquisition-related costs,
including $8.4 million in professional services fees and $1.0 million in
severance-related costs. The $3.4 million balance remaining at October 31,
2005 primarily relates to the class action settlement paid in December 2005
and to facilities closure costs, contract terminations and legal and
tax-related services.

The
Company has allocated the total purchase consideration to the assets and
liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their
respective fair values at the acquisition date, resulting in goodwill of
approximately $92.4 million. The following table summarizes the allocation of
the purchase price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.

Goodwill and Intangible
Assets.

Goodwill,
representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired in the merger, will not be
amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. The portion of the purchase
price allocated to identifiable intangible assets is as follows:

of operations for the year ended October 31, 2005.

Acquisition of ISE Integrated
Systems Engineering AG (ISE)

The Company acquired ISE
on November 2, 2004.

Reasons for the
Acquisition.

ISE’s
Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) software performs process simulation
and device and circuit simulation, helping semiconductor manufacturers shorten
the


time needed to
design chips and to test those designs prior to actual manufacturing. In
approving the merger agreement, Synopsys’ Board considered a number of factors,
including its opinions that (i) the merger of ISE’s TCAD organization with
Synopsys’ own TCAD business would permit the introduction of a consolidated
TCAD platform that addresses the challenges posed by future technologies while
maintaining continuity with existing software, and (ii) the merger would
enable Synopsys to help further reduce its customers’ costs and manufacturing
risks as they create smaller, faster and more power-efficient chips. The
Company does not consider the ISE acquisition material to its results of
operations, and therefore is not presenting pro forma statements of operations
for the year ended October 31, 2005.

Purchase Price.

The
Company paid $100.0 million in cash on November 2, 2004 to the former
shareholders of ISE. The total purchase consideration consisted of:

Under the acquisition agreement, the Company has also
agreed to pay up to $20 million over three years to certain former shareholders
and option holders of ISE now employed by Synopsys based upon achievement of
certain sales and employee retention milestones. Any amounts payable under this
arrangement will be accrued as compensation expense over the remaining expected
service period when and if management deems it probable such amounts will be
earned by the applicable milestone dates. As of October 31, 2005, the
Company had accrued $7.0 million under the agreement for probable achievement
against the first-year milestones; this amount was paid in November 2005
this amount was paid.

Acquisition-related costs of $2.6 million consist
primarily of legal, tax and accounting fees of $1.3 million, approximately $1.1
million of estimated facilities closure costs and other directly related
charges. As of October 31, 2005, the Company had paid $1.5 million of the
acquisition-related costs, including $1.0 million in professional services fees
and $0.2 million in facilities closure costs. The $1.0 million balance
remaining at October 31, 2005 primarily relates to facilities closure
costs, contract terminations and tax-related services.


The
Company has allocated the total purchase consideration to the assets and
liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their
respective fair values at the acquisition date, resulting in goodwill of
approximately $72.9 million. The following table summarizes the allocation of
the purchase price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.

The Company included amortization of the
core/developed technology in cost of revenue and amortization of other
intangible assets in operating expenses in its statement of operations for the
year ended October 31, 2005.

The in-process research and development (IPRD) expense
related to the ISE acquisition was $5.7 million. ISE had one IPRD project—FLOOPS,
a next generation process simulator. The Company incurred a minimal amount in
IPRD related to this project which led to the introduction of the Sentaurus
product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. This project is considered to be
complete except for ongoing maintenance, future product enhancements and new
features related to this core product. Expenditures to complete ISE’s acquired
in-process technologies approximated the original estimates.

During fiscal 2005, the
Company completed two additional asset acquisitions during fiscal 2005 for
aggregate consideration of $3.0 million. These acquisitions are not considered
material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet and results of operations.

Fiscal 2004 Acquisitions

In February 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Accelerant Networks, Inc.
(Accelerant) for total consideration of $23.8 million, and the acquisition of
the technology


assets of Analog Design
Automation, Inc. (ADA) for total consideration of $12.2 million. The
Company acquired Accelerant in order to enhance Synopsys’ standards-based
IP solutions. The Company acquired the assets of ADA in order to enhance the
Company’s analog and mixed signal offerings.

In October 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of Cascade Semiconductor Solutions, Inc. (Cascade) for total
upfront consideration of $15.8 million and contingent consideration of up
to $10.0 million to be paid upon the achievement of certain performance
milestones over the three years following the acquisition. Contingent
consideration totaling $2.1 million was paid during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005 and has been allocated to goodwill. The Company acquired Cascade,
an IP provider, in order to augment Synopsys’ offerings of PCI Express
products. Included in the total consideration for the Accelerant and Cascade
acquisitions are aggregate acquisition costs of $4.3 million, consisting
primarily of legal and accounting fees and other directly related charges. As
of October 31, 2005 the Company has paid substantially all the costs
related to these acquisitions.

In fiscal 2004, the Company completed one additional
acquisition and two additional asset acquisition transactions for aggregate
consideration of $12.3 million in upfront payments and acquisition-related
costs and contingent consideration of up to $5 million to be paid based on
the achievement of certain milestones. In process research and development
expenses associated with these acquisitions totaled $1.6 million for fiscal
2004. The Company does not consider these acquisition transactions to be
material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s balance sheet or results
of operations. As of October 31, 2005, the Company has paid substantially
all the costs related to these acquisitions.

The results of operations from these acquisitions are
included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the
date of each respective transaction through October 31, 2005.

The Company allocated the
total aggregate purchase consideration for these transactions to the assets and
liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their
respective fair values at the acquisition dates, resulting in aggregate
goodwill of $24.5 million. Aggregate identifiable intangible assets as a
result of these acquisitions, consisting primarily of purchased technology and
other intangibles, are $44.8 million, and are being amortized over three
to five years. Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase consideration
over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in
the acquisitions, will not be amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes.
The Company includes the amortization of purchased technology in cost of
revenue in its statements of operations.

Fiscal 2003
Acquisitions

Numerical
Technologies, Inc. (Numerical).

On March 1, 2003, the Company
completed its acquisition of Numerical. The Company acquired Numerical in order
to combine Numerical’s subwavelength, lithography-enabling solutions with
the Company’s leading integrated circuit (IC) design solutions and thereby help
reduce costs and manufacturing risk for the Company’s customers.

Purchase Price.

The Company paid Numerical common
stockholders $7.00 in cash in exchange for each share of Numerical common stock
owned as of the merger date, or approximately $240.2 million. The total
purchase consideration consisted of:

and $1.6 million in directors and officers liability insurance costs
incurred to cover Numerical’s former officers and Board of Directors as
required by the merger agreement. As of October 31, 2005, there are
substantially no remaining accrued or unpaid acquisition-related costs related
to this acquisition.

The
following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for Numerical
and the estimated amortization period for the acquired intangibles:

During fiscal 2003, the
Company completed two additional acquisitions for aggregate consideration
consisting of $8.8 million in upfront payments and acquisition expenses
and contingent consideration totaling $3.5 million based on the achievement
of certain milestones as outlined in the acquisition agreements. In-process
research and development expenses associated with these acquisitions totaled
$1.6 million for fiscal 2003. These acquisitions are not considered
material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s balance sheet and
results of operations. As of October 31, 2005 there are substantially no
remaining accrued or unpaid acquisition related costs related to these
acquisitions. The total consideration of $3.5 million was paid in full and
allocated to goodwill.


Note 4.   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, Net

Goodwill
consists of the following:

(1)

During fiscal year 2004,
additions represent an increase of goodwill of $17.4 million as a result
of an adjustment to the deferred tax assets recorded upon the acquisition of
Avant!, goodwill acquired in the acquisitions of Accelerant and Cascade of
$17.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, contingent consideration earned
and paid of $1.7 million related to and immaterial acquisition and amounts
related to foreign currency fluctuations for goodwill not denominated in U.S.
dollars.

(2)

During fiscal year 2005,
additions represent goodwill acquired in acquisitions of ISE and Nassda of
$72.9 million and $92.4 million, respectively, and contingent consideration
earned and paid of $1.7 million and $2.1 million related to an immaterial
acquisition and the acquisition of Cascade, respectively.

(3)

During the fiscal year
2005, Synopsys reduced goodwill primarily related to tax reserves for Avant! no
longer probable due to expiration of the federal statute of limitations for
claims.

Intangible
assets as of October 31, 2004 consisted of the following:

Note 5.   Financial Instruments

Cash, Cash Equivalents and
Investments.

Short-term
investments have been classified as available-for-sale securities and are
detailed as follows:

As of October 31,
2005, the stated maturities of the Company’s current investments are
$41.6 million within one year, $20.8 million within one to five
years, $10.8 million within five to ten years and $108.9 million
after ten years. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are
recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or
losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of tax. Realized gains and losses on sales of short-term
investments have not been material in any period presented.

Strategic Investments.

The Company’s strategic investment
portfolio consists of minority equity investments in publicly traded companies
and investments in privately held companies. The securities of


publicly traded
companies are classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115),

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or
losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. These securities of privately held companies
are reported at cost. As of October 31, 2005, the carrying value of the
Company’s strategic investments was $8.1 million.

During the years ended October 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company determined that certain strategic investments
with an aggregate value of $6.5 million, $3.5 million and
$7.1 million, respectively, were impaired and that the impairment was
other than temporary. Accordingly, the Company recorded charges of
approximately $4.5 million, $3.0 million and $4.5 million during
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, to write down the carrying value of
these investments.

Debt.

As
of October 31, 2005, and 2004, the Company’s debt totaled $7.3 million and
$7.4 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of notes related to
acquisitions payable in 2007 and notes to secure bonds related to certain
property taxes. In connection with the notes to secure bonds, in the ordinary
course of business, tax liens have been imposed upon certain land owned by the
Company by a governmental agency. To date, the Company has made all applicable
payments against these notes.

Foreign Currency Contracts.

The maximum original duration of the
foreign currency forward contracts is 16 months, however for the majority of
the currencies, the forward contracts are one month in duration. Due to the
short

-

term nature of these contracts, the
contract rates approximate fair value as of October 31, 2005 and 2004.

In April 2004,
Synopsys entered into a three-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured
revolving credit facility. This facility contains financial covenants requiring
that the Company maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of
cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on April 28,
2007. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the
administrative agent’s prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%;
however, the Company has the option to pay interest based on the outstanding
amount at euro dollar rates plus a spread between 0.80% and 1.125% based on a
pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In addition, commitment fees are
payable on the facility at rates between 0.20% and 0.25% per annum based on a
pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. In April 2004 and May 2005,
the Company borrowed and repaid $200.0 and $75.0 million, respectively, under
the credit facility. As of October 31, 2005, the Company had no
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and was in compliance with all
covenants.

Note 6.   Commitments
and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain
of its domestic and foreign facilities and certain office equipment under
non-cancelable lease agreements. The facilities generally require the Company
to pay property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repair costs. Rent expense
was $36.2 million, $35.5 million and $35.1 million in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has the option to extend or
renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease
commitments. In October 2003, the Company entered into a sublease
agreement pursuant to which the Company subleases to a third party a portion of
its office space which the Company owns in Sunnyvale, California. The sublease
agreement terminates in February 2009. The Company receives monthly
sublease payments of $150,000.


Future
minimum lease payments on all operating leases, net of sublease income, as of October 31,
2005 are as follows:

Legal Proceedings

On August 25, 2004, a
class action complaint entitled

Kanekal v. Synopsys, Inc.,
et al

., No. C-04-3580, was filed in federal
district court for the Northern District of California against the Company and
certain of its officers alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The complaint purported to be a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of
persons who acquired the Company’s stock during the period of December 3,
2003 through August 18, 2004. The complaint alleged that the individual
defendants caused the Company’ to make false and misleading statements about
Synopsys’ business, forecasts, and financial performance, and that certain
Synopsys officers or employees sold portions of their stock holdings while in
the possession of adverse, non-public information. The complaint did not
specify the amount of damages sought. In November 2004, the Court
appointed a lead plaintiff in the case. In January 2005, the lead
plaintiff, the Wu Group, filed an amended complaint. The Company

filed a
motion to dismiss the amended complaint and a motion for sanctions in March 2005.
In August 2005, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, but
denied the motion for sanctions, and allowed the plaintiff 30 days to amend the
complaint. The parties stipulated to a dismissal with prejudice with each
side bearing its own fees and costs, and in September 2005, the case was
dismissed.

In connection with the Company’s December 1,
2004 announcement that it had signed agreements to acquire Nassda Corporation
(Nassda) and to settle all outstanding litigation between the two companies, a
class action complaint entitled

Robert Israel v. Nassda
Corporation, et. al

., No. 4705695, was filed in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware naming Nassda, its directors and the Company
as defendants. The complaint purported to be a class action lawsuit
brought on behalf of shareholders of Nassda, other than the defendant directors
and their affiliates, who allegedly would be injured or threatened with injury
if the proposed acquisition of Nassda by the Company proceeded forward on the
terms announced. A class action complaint alleging substantially the same facts
was also filed in California Superior Court. The purported class actions sought to
enjoin the transaction or, alternatively, unspecified damages. In May 2005,
the Company completed its acquisition of Nassda. In October, 2005, the Chancery
Court approved a settlement of the Delaware action by which the
Company would pay an aggregate of $0.15 per share to each former
shareholder of Nassda (other than the defendant directors and their
affiliates), for a total of approximately $1.8 million, and would pay certain
fees and expenses of plaintiff’s counsel. In December 2005, the
plaintiffs in the Delaware action dismissed their complaint with prejudice and
the Company paid the agreed-upon amounts. The California action was also
dismissed with prejudice in December 2005, with each side bearing its own
costs.


Note 7.   Stockholders’ Equity

Stock
Repurchase Programs.

In
July 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
program under which Synopsys’ common stock with a market value up to
$500 million may be acquired in the open market. This stock repurchase
program replaced all prior repurchase programs authorized by the Board. The
Company uses all common shares repurchased for ongoing stock issuances such as
existing employee stock option plans, existing stock purchase plans and
acquisitions. The July 2001 stock repurchase program has been renewed by
the Company’s Board of Directors annually through December 2004. In each
renewal the Board of Directors replenished the amount of the program up to
$500 million. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company purchased
approximately 5.1 million shares at an average price of $17.20 per share,
approximately 16.9 million shares at an average price of $25.02 per share,
and approximately 9.4 million shares at an average price of $27.72 per
share, respectively.

Preferred
Shares Rights Plan.

The
Company has adopted a number of provisions that could have anti-takeover
effects, including a Preferred Shares Rights Plan. In addition, the Board of
Directors has the authority, without further action by its stockholders, to fix
the rights and preferences and issue shares of authorized but undesignated
shares of Preferred Stock. This provision and other provisions of the Company’s
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Delaware General
Corporation Law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying
or preventing changes in control or management of the Company, including
transactions in which the stockholders of the Company might otherwise receive a
premium for their shares over then current market prices. The preferred share
rights expire on October 24, 2007.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan.

Under
the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and International Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (collectively, the ESPP), employees are granted the right to
purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser
of the fair market value of the shares at (i) the beginning of a rolling
two-year offering period or (ii) the end of each semi-annual purchase
period, subject to a plan limit on the number of shares that may be purchased
in a purchase period. During fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003 the Company issued an
aggregate of 2,107,599, 1,898,402, and 1,536,574 shares, respectively, under
the ESPP at average per share prices of $13.49, $15.51, and $17.35,
respectively. As of October 31, 2005, 7,828,034 shares of common stock
were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP. On May 23, 2005, the
stockholders approved two amendments to the ESPP to increase (1) the
number of shares issuable under the Purchase Plan by 4.0 million shares and (2) the
aggregate number of shares of common stock purchasable on a worldwide basis by
all participants on any one semi-annual purchase date from 1.0 million shares
of common stock to 2.0 million shares. As a result, a total of 21.7 million shares
have been authorized for issuance pursuant to the ESPP as of October 31,
2005.

Stock
Option Plans.

Under
the Company’s 1992 Stock Option Plan (the 1992 Plan), 38,866,356 shares of
common stock have been authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 1992 Plan, the
Board of Directors (the Board) may grant either incentive or non-qualified
stock options to purchase shares of common stock to employees and consultants,
excluding non-employee directors at not less than 100% of the fair market value
of those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1992 Plan
generally vest over a period of four years and expire seven to ten years from
the date of grant. As of October 31, 2005, 8,176,116 stock options remain
outstanding and 6,758,621 shares of common stock are reserved for future grants
under this plan.

Under the Company’s 1998 Non-Statutory Stock Option
Plan (the 1998 Plan), 50,295,546 shares of common stock have been authorized
for issuance. Pursuant to the 1998 Plan, the Board may grant non-qualified
stock options to employees and consultants, excluding executive officers.
Exercisability, option price and other terms are determined by the Board but
the option price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
those shares on the grant date. Stock options granted under the 1998 Plan
generally vest over a period of four years and expire seven to ten years from
the date of grant. As of


October 31, 2005,
24,049,124 stock options remain outstanding and 4,056,942 shares of common
stock were reserved for future grants under this plan.

Under the Company’s 2005 Assumed Stock Option Plan
(formerly, the Nassda Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan), an aggregate of 3,594,565
shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance. Pursuant to the 2005
Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board or its designee can grant
non-qualified stock options to employees or consultants of the Company who
either were (i) not employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries on May 11,
2005 or (ii) providing services to Nassda Corporation (or any subsidiary
corporation thereof) prior to May 11, 2005. Exercisability, option price
and other terms are determined by the Board but the option price shall not be
less than 100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date.
Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan generally vest over a period of four
years and expire seven to ten years from the date of grant. As of October 31,
2005, 784,952 stock options remain outstanding and 2,504,642 shares of common
stock were reserved for future grant under this plan.

On May 23, 2005, stockholders approved the 2005
Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the Directors Plan) and the
reservation of 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. The
Directors Plan provides for annual equity awards to non-employee directors in
the form of either stock options or restricted stock. On May 23, 2005, the
Company issued non-employee directors an aggregate of 42,060 shares of
restricted stock with an aggregate value of approximately $0.75 million on the
date of grant, which was recorded as deferred compensation and will be
amortized over the vesting period of three years.

Under certain
circumstances, restricted stock may be forfeited back to the Company. The
Company’s forfeiture rights lapse over a three year period. At October 31,
2005, 36,210 shares were subject to future forfeitures. As of October 31,
2005, 257,940 shares of common stock were reserved for future grant under the
Directors Plan. An aggregate of 1,277,660 stock options remain outstanding
under the Company’s 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, which
expired as to future grants in October 2004.

In March 2005, the Board of Directors approved an
option exchange program under which outstanding employee stock options (other
than options held by executive officers) with exercise prices of $25.00 or
greater per share could be exchanged for a lesser number of options granted at
current fair market value and with a new vesting period. The Board adopted this
program due to the fact that the exercise prices of a large number of
outstanding employee stock options were significantly below the Company’s stock
price and thus did not provide adequate employee incentive. The Company’s stockholders
approved the program in May 2005. As a result, on June 23, 2005, the
Company accepted for cancellation options to purchase 7.3 million shares of
common stock and in exchange granted to eligible employees options to purchase
3.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $17.16
per share, except for options to purchase approximately 22,000 shares which
were issued with an exercise price of $18.06 due to regional laws regarding the
pricing of stock option grants. As a result of the exchange, the Company will
use variable accounting for all options eligible for the exchange under the
provisions of APB 25 and related interpretations until adoption of SFAS 123R in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Total compensation expense recorded with
respect to these options for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 was
$0.6 million.

The Company has assumed certain option plans in
connection with business combinations. Generally, the options granted under
these plans have terms similar to the Company’s own options. The exercise
prices of such options have been adjusted to reflect the relative exchange
ratios.


Additional
information concerning stock option activity under all plans is as follows:

Includes an aggregate of
3.8 million shares issued in connection with the option exchange.

deferred tax assets of $277.9 million and $272.0 million were recorded as
of October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net deferred tax asset of
$277.9 million for fiscal 2005 includes the tax effects of acquired companies.
The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

As of October 31, 2005, the Company believes it
is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate
sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.

IRS
Revenue Agent’s Report.

On May 31, 2005,
the Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) asserting a very large net increase to its U.S. taxable income
arising from the audit of fiscal years 2000 and 2001. On June 8, 2005, the
Company received a Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) in which the IRS proposed to
assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately
$476.8 million, plus interest. Interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency
finally determined until paid, and compounds daily at the federal underpayment
rate, which adjusts quarterly. A higher underpayment rate of interest may be
charged as a result of the issuance of the RAR.

This proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer
pricing transactions between the Company and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary.
The proposed adjustment for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 is the total amount
relating to these transactions asserted under the IRS theories. On July 13,
2005, the Company filed


a protest to the proposed
deficiency with the IRS, which will cause the matter to be referred to the
Appeals Office of the IRS. Resolution of this matter could take a considerable
time, possibly years.

The Company strongly believes the proposed IRS
adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable
tax laws, and that the Company thus has meritorious defenses to these
proposals. Accordingly, the Company will continue to challenge these proposed
adjustments vigorously. While it believes the IRS’ asserted adjustments are not
supported by applicable law, the Company believes it is probable the Company
will be required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter.
However, based on the Company’s analysis to date, the Company believes it has
adequately provided for this matter. If the Company is required to pay a
significant amount of additional U.S. taxes and applicable interest in excess
of its provision for this matter, its results of operations and financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected.

Tax
loss carry forwards and tax credits.

The Company
has federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately $12.9 million as of October 31,
2005. The loss carryforwards will expire in 2008 through 2024. The Company has
state net operating loss carryforwards tax benefits of $3.5 million as of October 31, 2005.
State net operating loss carryforward periods range from 5 to 20 years. Any
losses not utilized within a specified state’s carryforward period will expire.
As of October 31, 2005, the Company classified a portion of the tax loss
carryforwards, federal foreign tax credits and federal and California research
and development credits as non-current because the prospect of utilization of
all of these deferred tax assets in the relevant jurisdiction is not expected
in the next twelve months. Because of the change in ownership provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, a portion of the Company’s loss carryforwards may be
subject to annual limitations. The annual limitation may result in the
expiration of the net operating loss before utilization. Management believes
that all net operating losses will be utilized, and a valuation allowance is
not necessary. The tax benefit of federal net operating losses attributable to
employee stock options is credited directly to stockholders’ equity.

The Company has federal foreign tax credits of
$58.3 million. The foreign tax credits expire on various dates from 2008
through 2014. The Company has federal and California research and development
credits of $25.1 million and $19.5 million, respectively. If not
utilized, the federal research and development credits will begin to expire on
various dates in 2006 through 2024. The California research and development
credits do not expire. In addition, the Company has $3.6 million of federal
alternative minimum tax credits which have no expiration date. The provision of
income taxes includes a tax expense of $2.2 million arising from various state
and foreign taxes which was treated as a discrete event allocable to the first
quarter of year ended October 31, 2005.

The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on the
earnings of its foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently
invested outside of the U.S. As of October 31, 2005, there was no
cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided.

Repatriation
of foreign earnings.

The American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (the Act) provides for a special one-time elective dividends
received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S.
taxpayer equal to 85% of the eligible distribution. During the fourth quarter
of 2005, the Company repatriated $360.0 million, of which $172.5 million
qualified for the special one-time elective dividends received deduction and
$187.5 million constituted earnings that do not qualify under the Act,
previously taxed income and return of capital. The Company recorded tax expense
of $11.2 million related to the repatriation of $360 million. During the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company’s chief executive officer approved a domestic
reinvestment plan (DRIP) to invest up to $185.0 million in foreign earnings in
qualified investments pursuant to the Act. As required by the Act, the
reinvestment plan was ratified by the Board of Directors in the first quarter
of fiscal 2006. The Company satisfied the DRIP reinvestment requirements during
fiscal 2005.


Tax reserves.

The
Company may establish reserves for tax contingencies based on the probable
outcome of tax positions taken for financial statement purposes compared to
positions taken on the tax returns. In fiscal 2005, the Company released tax
contingency reserves totaling $34.0 million related to previously acquired
companies as a result of the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitation. These released liabilities were recorded against acquisition
goodwill with no effect on the Company’s net loss in fiscal 2005. The Company
continuously reviews its tax-contingency reserves to ensure that they are
appropriately stated. Such review includes consideration of tax controversy
factors such as periods covered by the cause of action, the degree of
probability of an unfavorable outcome, the Company’s ability to estimate the
liability, the timing of the liability and how it will impact the Company’s
other tax attributes. At October 31, 2005, the Company believes that it
has adequately provided for its tax-related liabilities.

Note 9.   Other Income, Net

Other
income (expense), net consists of the following:

(1)

Includes $33 million for
the Nassda litigation settlement. See Note 3.

In the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Company reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging

(SFAS 133), resulting
in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain
prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. The effect of the error was not
material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of the Company’s
hedging program. To correct the error, the Company has reclassified the
remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other
comprehensive loss to other income in the year ended October 31, 2005.

Note 10.   Segment Disclosure

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131
(SFAS 131),

Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information

, requires disclosures of
certain information regarding operating segments, products and services, geographic
areas of operation and major customers. SFAS 131 reporting is based upon
the “management approach,” i.e., how management organizes the Company’s
operating segments for which separate financial information is (i) available
and (ii) evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Synopsys’
CODMs are the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating
Officer.

The Company provides software products and consulting
services in the electronic design automation software industry. The Company
operates in a single segment. In making operating decisions, the
CODMs primarily consider consolidated financial information, accompanied
by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region. Specifically,
the CODMs consider where individual “seats” or licenses to the Company’s
products are used in allocating revenue to particular geographic areas. Revenue
is defined as revenues from external customers. Goodwill is not allocated since
the Company operates in one reportable operating segment.


Revenue
and property and equipment, net related to operations in the United States and
other geographic areas were:

Geographic revenue data for multi-region, multi-product
transactions reflect internal allocations and is therefore subject to certain
assumptions and to the Company’s methodology.

For
management reporting purposes, the Company organizes its products and services
into five distinct groups: Galaxy Design Platform, Discovery Verification
Platform, Intellectual Property (IP), Design for Manufacturing and Professional
Services & Other. The following table summarizes the revenue
attributable to these groups as a percentage of total revenue for the fiscal
years presented. The Company includes revenue from companies or products the
Company has acquired during a period from the acquisition date through the end
of the relevant periods. For presentation purposes, the Company allocates
maintenance, which represented approximately 14% of its total revenue and
approximately 73% of our total services revenue for fiscal 2005, to the
products to which those support services relate.

One customer, Intel
Corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate, accounted for more than ten
percent of the Company’s consolidated revenue in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Note 11.   Termination
of Agreement to Acquire Monolithic System Technology, Inc.

On February 23, 2004, the Company entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire Monolithic System Technology, Inc. (MoSys)
in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $453 million.


On April 16, 2004, the Company exercised the
right to terminate the merger agreement and paid MoSys a $10.0 million
termination fee. The Company has included the termination fee in general and
administrative expense in the statement of operations for fiscal 2004. On April 23,
2004, MoSys filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court against Synopsys and
Mountain Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, alleging
that the Company improperly exercised its termination right.

On July 9, 2004, the
Company and MoSys announced a settlement under which the suit was dismissed
without further liability or payments to one another.

Note 12.   Related
Party and Other Transactions

Revenues derived from Intel Corporation and its
subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 10% of
the Company’s total revenue for the fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Andy D. Bryant, Intel Corporation’s Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial and Enterprise Services Officer, also served on the Company’s Board
of Directors from January 1999 to May 2005. Management believes all
transactions between the two parties were carried out on an arm’s length basis.
Accounts receivable amounts recorded from Intel were insignificant as of October 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company had a joint venture with Davan Tech
Co., Ltd, of Korea (Davan Tech) whereby Davan Tech acted as a
non-exclusive distributor for the Company subject to certain conditions as
defined in the distribution agreement. As of October 31, 2003, the Company
owned approximately 10% of Davan Tech, and accounted for the investment under
the cost basis. During fiscal 2003, the Company recognized revenues totaling
$3.9 million, from Davan Tech. Accounts receivable included
$0.9 million of receivable from Davan Tech as of October 31, 2003. In
December 2003, the Company terminated its distribution agreement with
Davan Tech and in March 2004 the Company sold its ownership interest in
Davantech.

The Company maintains a System-on-a-Chip Venture Fund
(the Fund) authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors which invests in
companies that will facilitate building SoCs. The Fund is administered by an
investment advisory board consisting of senior Company officers, including the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and Dr. A.
Richard Newton, a member of the Company’s Board. Among other investments, the
Fund has invested an aggregate of approximately $1 million in a private
company that develops SoC test systems. At the times of the investments,
SmartForest Ventures, a venture capital firm of which Company director Deborah
Coleman serves as a general partner, owned in excess of 10% of the outstanding
shares of such company. Ms. Coleman did not participate in any of the Fund’s
investment decisions.

During fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, director Richard Newton, provided consulting services to the Company
and was paid $180,000 annually. Under the Company’s agreement with Dr. Newton,
Dr. Newton provides advice, at the Company’s request, concerning long-term
technology strategy and industry development issues as well as assistance in
identifying opportunities for partnerships with academia.

Note
13.   Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2005, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Nos. FAS 115-1
and FAS 124-1,

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

.
This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered
impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement
of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations
subsequent to the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. The adoption
of this FSP is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
guidance in this FSP will be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2005.


In June 2005, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 154,

Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections

(SFAS 154), which changes the
requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required
recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period
of the change. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’
financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the
period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 is
effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2005; however, SFAS 154 does not change the transition provisions of any
existing accounting pronouncements.

In March 2005, the FASB published FASB
Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations

, which clarifies that the term, “conditional
asset retirement obligation,” as used in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

, refers to a legal obligation to perform an
asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the
entity. The uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a
conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement
of the liability when sufficient information exists. The interpretation also
clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This interpretation
is effective no later than the end of the Company’s fiscal 2006. The adoption
of this Interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), which,
Synopsys will be required to follow beginning in its first quarter of fiscal
2006. SFAS 123R will result in the recognition of substantial compensation
expense relating to the Company’s employee stock options and employee stock
purchase plans. As noted in Note 2, currently the Company generally does not
recognize any compensation expense related to stock option grants the Company
issues under its stock option plans or related to the discounts the Company
provides under its employee stock purchase plans. Under the new rules, the
Company will be required to adopt a fair-value-based method for measuring the
compensation expense related to employee stock awards. The resulting additional
compensation expense will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
reported results of operations. SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for
share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under
APB 25 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted
for using a fair-value-based method. The Company will recognize stock-based
compensation expense on all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period using the modified prospective method. In January 2005, the
SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation
guidance for SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company beginning
in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets

(SFAS 153), an amendment of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29. SFAS 153 addresses the
measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of
transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. SFAS 153 is effective for the Company for nonmonetary asset
exchanges beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption of SFAS 153
is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 14.   Subsequent Events

On December 7, 2005, the Company closed its
acquisition of HPL Technologies, Inc. (HPL) in an all-cash transaction for
a purchase price of $0.30 per share. HPL is a leader in yield management
software and test chip solutions and the acquisition is a part of the Company’s
strategy to enhance its DFM offerings.


On December 22, 2005,
the Company announced that Brian M. Beattie will be appointed as Chief
Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) of the Company, effective January 16,
2006.

Selected
Unaudited Quarterly Financial Data

The
table below includes certain unaudited financial information for the last four
fiscal quarters.

(1)

Subsequent to the fourth

quarter of fiscal 2005, we discovered an
error in our option grant process related to the documentation of grant dates.
This error was solely with respect to grants to non-executive officer
employees. The impact of this error on our first through third quarter income
statement was approximately $3.1 million. We booked in the fourth quarter $3.6
million as follows: $0.5 million in cost of goods sold, $1.3 million in
research and development expense, $0.9 million in sales and marketing expense
and $0.9 million in general and administrative expense. Our results of
operations for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2005 contained in our
earnings release dated November 30, 2005 did not include this expense as
we did not believe at that time the error would result in an adjustment to our
operating results. With the error corrected, we expect we will incur no
additional expenses relating to this error.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

(a)   Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

.   Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for
Synopsys. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
executive officer and acting chief financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of

the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October
31, 2005. In making


this assessment, our management used the framework established
in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(“COSO”).

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected. Management identified a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2005 related to our accounting for income taxes. Specifically, our
processes and procedures did not include adequate management oversight and
review of our income tax accounting practices. As a result of the
aforementioned material weakness, certain of our income tax accounting
calculations and reserves contained errors which were, in aggregate,
material. Specifically, (i) we did not appropriately consider the
impact of existing tax reserves on the calculation of tax expense related to our
repatriation of foreign earnings under the American

Jobs Creation Act of 2004,

thus overstating income tax expense and the related tax liability

and (ii) upon expiration of the Federal statute of
limitations, we did not reduce an existing tax reserve established upon
consummation of a 2002 business combination, thus overstating tax reserves
and goodwill as of October 31, 2005. These errors were corrected prior to
the issuance of our 2005 consolidated financial statements.

Because of the material weakness described above,
management has concluded Synopsys did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of October  31, 2005, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting
firm, has issued an auditors’ report on management’s assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005, which report appears
below.

(b)

Changes in Internal Controls.

There were no changes in
Synopsys' internal controls over financial reporting during the three months
ended October 31, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, Synopsys' internal control over financial reporting.

We are taking the
following actions to remediate the material weakness described above: (i)
implementing additional recurring review procedures to help ensure compliance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and other applicable rules and
regulations with respect to tax matters; (ii) establishing additional
procedures to help identify and address tax accounting issues in a more timely
and comprehensive manner; and (iii) reorganizing and augmenting our tax
department to improve communication. Actions (i) and (ii) will be in place in
connection with the preparation of our first quarter financial statements and action
(iii) is being implemented and will be completed as soon as practicable.

(c)

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.

As of October 31, 2005 (the “Evaluation
Date”), Synopsys carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of Synopsys’ management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Acting Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of Synopsys’ disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). There are
inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls
and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures
can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving their control
objectives. However, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, Synopsys’ disclosure
controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by
this report due to the material weakness identified in Management's Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, above.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders

Synopsys, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting (Item 9A(a)), that Synopsys, Inc. (the “Company”) did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of
October 31, 2005, because of the effect of a material weakness identified
in management’s assessment, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected. The Company identified a material
weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
October 31, 2005, related to the Company’s accounting for income
taxes. Specifically, the Company’s processes and procedures did not include
adequate management oversight and review of the Company’s income tax accounting
practices. As a result of the aforementioned material weakness, certain of the
Company’s income tax accounting calculations and reserves contained errors
which were, in aggregate, material. Specifically, (i) the Company did
not appropriately consider the impact of existing tax reserves on the
calculation of tax expense related to the Company’s repatriation of foreign
earnings under the American

Jobs Creation
Act of 2004,

thus
overstating income tax expense and the related tax liability and
(ii) upon expiration of the Federal statute of limitations, the Company
did not


reduce an existing
tax reserve established upon consummation of a 2002 business combination,
thus overstating tax reserves and goodwill as of October 31, 2005.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Synopsys, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
October 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31,
2005. The aforementioned material weakness was considered in determining the
nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal
2005 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our
report dated January 12, 2006, which expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that Synopsys, Inc. did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, because
of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of
the objectives of the control criteria, Synopsys, Inc. has not maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).

, and is incorporated by reference here.

There are no family
relationships among any of our executive officers, directors or persons
nominated to become directors.

Identification
of Audit Committee and Financial Expert

Synopsys’ Audit Committee
is comprised of directors Ms. Coleman, Dr. Somekh and Mr. Vallee.
All of such members satisfy the independence criteria of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. for serving on an audit committee.
SEC regulations require Synopsys to disclose whether its Board of Directors has
determined that a director qualifying as a “financial expert” serves on the
Synopsys’ Audit Committee. Synopsys’ Board of Directors has determined that
both Ms. Coleman and Mr. Vallee qualify as financial experts within
the meaning of such regulations.


Section 16(a) Beneficial
Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
our directors, executive officers and greater than ten percent beneficial
owners of our stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with
the SEC. Directors, executive officers and greater than ten percent
stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish Synopsys with copies of
all Section 16(a) reports they file.

Based solely on its review
of the copies of the Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by or received from its reporting
persons (or written representations received from such persons), Synopsys
believes that each of its directors, executive officers and greater than ten
percent beneficial owners of its stock during fiscal 2005 complied with all
filing requirements applicable to such persons.

Adoption of Code of
Ethics

Synopsys has adopted a
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the Code) applicable to all of its Board

the Code, or (ii) any waivers under the Code given to Synopsys’ Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Controller and
Treasurer by posting such information on its website at

www.synopsys.com/corporate/governance

Director Compensation

Non-employee directors receive a combination of cash
and stock as compensation for Board service. Such directors receive an annual
retainer of $125,000. In addition, Audit Committee members receive $2,000
($4,000 in the case of the Chair) for each Audit Committee meeting attended, up
to a maximum of four meetings per year.

Non-employee directors
also receive equity compensation under Synopsys’ 2005 Non-Employee
Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the Directors Plan). The Directors Plan
provides for automatic grants to each non-employee member of our Board
upon their initial appointment or election and upon their reelection each year.
The award price per share is 100% of the fair market value of our common stock
on the grant date. New non-employee directors receive a stock option for
30,000 shares, vesting in equal annual installments on the date preceding each
of the first four annual meetings of stockholders following the grant date,
assuming continued Board service through each vesting date. Continuing Board
members receive either (1) an option grant (with the number of shares
determined so that the aggregate “fair value” of the option, calculated using
the option pricing model used to estimate the value of compensatory stock
options in our financial statements, would equal the annual cash retainer then
paid to non-employee Board members) or (2) a restricted stock grant
(with the number of shares subject to the award determined so that the fair
market value of the restricted stock grant on the date of grant would equal the
annual cash retainer then paid to non-employee Board members). The option
grant or restricted stock vests in a series of 36 successive equal monthly
installments from the grant date, assuming continued Board membership through
each vesting date. The Board elected to receive restricted stock for the 2005
grant and, as a result, in May 2005 Synopsys issued an aggregate of 7,010
shares of restricted stock to each non-employee director under the Directors
Plan. The Directors Plan expires in May 2007.

Change
of Control Agreements and Named Executive Officer Employment Contracts

1992 Stock Option Plan

Under our 1992 Stock
Option Plan (the 1992 Plan), if we are acquired or in the event of a change in
control, including an acquisition of Synopsys by merger or asset sale, each
outstanding option under the 1992 Plan will automatically become exercisable in
full, unless the option is assumed by the successor corporation, or parent
thereof, or replaced by a comparable option to purchase shares of the capital
stock of the successor corporation or parent thereof. In addition, in the event
of a successful hostile tender offer for more than 50% of our outstanding
shares of common stock or a change in the majority of our Board as a result of
a contested election for membership on our Board, the administrator of the 1992
Plan has the authority to accelerate vesting of outstanding options or shares
purchased under the 1992 Plan.

2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan

In the event of a
corporate transaction, as such term is defined in the Directors Plan, each
outstanding stock option and restricted stock award will automatically
accelerate in full unless the stock option or our reacquisition rights with
respect to the restricted stock award are assumed by or assigned to the
successor corporation or its parent corporation. In the event of a change in
control, as such term is defined in the 2005 Directors Plan, each stock award
under the 2005 Directors Plan will automatically vest as to all shares subject
to the stock award immediately prior to the effective date of the change in
control.

1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan

Our 1994 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan (the 1994 Plan) was the predecessor to the
Directors Plan. The 1994 Plan expired in October 2004. An aggregate of
1,277,660 options remain outstanding under such plan and are held by
non-employee directors. Under the 1994 Plan, in the event of


a change
of control or corporate transaction, as such terms are defined in the plan, all
outstanding options become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of such
change of control or corporate transaction.

Employment Agreements

We have entered into
employment agreements, effective October 1, 1997, with our Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Operating Officer. Each
employment agreement provides that if such officer is terminated involuntarily
other than for cause within 24 months of a change of control, (a) such
officer will be paid an amount equal to two times the sum of such officer’s
annual base pay plus his target cash bonus, and the cash value such officer’s
health benefits for an 18-month period, and (b) all stock options
held by such officer will immediately vest in full. If the officer is
terminated involuntarily other than for cause in any other situation, the
officer will receive a cash payment equal to the sum of the officer’s annual
base pay for one year plus the target cash bonus for such year and cash value
of the executive’s health benefits for 12 months. The terms “involuntary
termination,” “cause” and  “change of
control” are defined in the employment agreements, which have been filed with
the SEC.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and
Related Stockholder Matters

Ownership
of the Company’s Securities

The
following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial
ownership of Synopsys’ common stock as of December 31, 2005 by (1) each
person known by Synopsys to beneficially own more than five percent of Synopsys’
common stock outstanding on that date, (2) each Synopsys director, (3) each
of the named executive officers and (4) all of Synopsys’ directors and
executive officers as a group.

Less than 1%

(1)

Beneficial ownership is
determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes
voting or investment power with respect to securities. Except as indicated by
footnote, and subject to


community property laws
where applicable, we believe, based on information furnished by such persons
and from Forms 13F, 13G and 13D filed with the SEC, that the persons named in
the table above have sole voting and investment power with respect to all
shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them as of December 31,
2005. Percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 144,372,085 shares of
common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2005, adjusted as required by
SEC rules. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person or
group and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock
issuable pursuant to options held by that person that are currently exercisable
or exercisable by that person or group within 60 days of December 31,
2005 are deemed to be beneficially owned. Such shares, however, are not deemed
outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other
person.

filed with the SEC on October 11, 2005, reporting beneficial ownership as

consulting services to us, for which he was paid $180,000. Under our agreement,
Dr. Newton provides advice, at our request, concerning long-term
technology strategy and industry development issues, as well as assistance in
identifying opportunities for partnerships with academia.

Revenues derived from Intel Corporation and its
subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 10% of
our fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 revenues, respectively. Andy D. Bryant, Intel’s
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,

on an arm’s length basis. Accounts receivable amounts recorded from Intel were
insignificant as of October 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

We have entered into
