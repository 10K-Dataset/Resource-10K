KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

TABLE OF
CONTENTS


PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Kimberly-Clark Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The
Corporation is a global health and hygiene company focused on building its personal care, consumer tissue and business-to-business operations. The Corporation is principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of a wide range of health and
hygiene products around the world. Most of these products are made from natural or synthetic fibers using advanced technologies in fibers, nonwovens and absorbency. As used in Items 1, 1A, 2, 3, 6, 7, 7A, 8 and 9A of this Form 10-K, the term
“Corporation” refers to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. In the remainder of this Form 10-K, the terms “Kimberly-Clark” or “Corporation” refer only to Kimberly-Clark Corporation. For
financial information by business segment and geographic area, and information about principal products and markets of the Corporation, reference is made to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” and to Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Developments

In July 2005, the
Corporation authorized the initial phase of a multi-year program to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations, primarily in North
America and Europe (the “Competitive Improvement Initiatives”). The Competitive Improvement Initiatives commenced in the third quarter of 2005. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” and Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 18, 2006, the Corporation authorized two subsequent phase projects pursuant to the Competitive Improvement Initiatives. One project is to reduce the workforce in Europe in order to streamline
administrative operations. The other project authorized the closure of two manufacturing facilities elsewhere.

During 2005, the Corporation repatriated approximately $985 million of previously unremitted earnings of certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries under the
provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This Act provides, among other things, for a one-time deduction for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to and reinvested in the U.S. As a result, the Corporation recorded income tax
expense and a related income tax liability of approximately $55.5 million in 2005.

On November 30, 2004, the Corporation distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Neenah Paper, Inc. (“Neenah Paper”). Neenah Paper was formed in April 2004 to
facilitate the spin-off of the Corporation’s U.S. fine paper and technical paper businesses and its Canadian pulp mills (the “Spin-off”). See Item 8, Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the Spin-off.

Description of the Corporation

The Corporation is organized into operating segments
based on product groupings. These operating segments have been aggregated into three reportable global business segments: Personal Care; Consumer Tissue; and Business-to-Business. The reportable segments were determined in accordance with how the
Corporation’s executive managers develop and execute the Corporation’s global strategies to drive growth and profitability of the Corporation’s worldwide Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and Business-to-Business operations. These
strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management, and capacity and capital investments for each of these businesses. The principal
sources of revenue in each of our global business segments are described below. Revenue, profit and total assets of each reportable segment are described in Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



PART I

(Continued)

The Personal Care segment manufactures and markets disposable diapers, training and youth pants, and
swimpants; baby wipes; feminine and incontinence care products; and related products. Products in this segment are primarily for household use and are sold under a variety of brand names, including Huggies, Pull-Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites,
Kotex, Lightdays, Depend, Poise and other brand names.

The
Consumer Tissue segment manufactures and markets facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use. Products in this segment are sold under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, Viva, Andrex, Scottex, Hakle, Page and
other brand names.

The Business-to-Business segment
manufactures and markets disposable, single-use, health and hygiene products to the away-from-home marketplace. These products include facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers, surgical gowns, drapes, infection control products,
sterilization wrap, disposable face masks and exam gloves, respiratory products, other disposable medical products and other products. Products in this segment are sold under the Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex, Scott, Kimwipes, WypAll, Surpass, Safeskin,
Tecnol, Ballard and other brand names.

Products for household
use are sold directly, and through wholesalers, to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, drugstores, warehouse clubs, variety and department stores and other retail outlets. Products for away-from-home use are sold through distributors and directly to
manufacturing, lodging, office building, food service, health care establishments and high volume public facilities. In addition, certain products are sold to converters.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. were approximately 13 percent of net sales in each year.

Patents and Trademarks

The Corporation owns various patents and trademarks registered domestically
and in many foreign countries. The Corporation considers the patents and trademarks which it owns and the trademarks under which it sells certain of its products to be material to its business. Consequently, the Corporation seeks patent and
trademark protection by all available means, including registration.

Raw
Materials

Superabsorbent materials are important
components in disposable diapers, training and youth pants and incontinence care products. Polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics, which are used in disposable diapers,
training and youth pants, wet wipes, feminine pads, incontinence and health care products, and away-from-home wipers.

Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or fiber recycled from recovered pulp, is the primary raw material for the Corporation’s tissue products
and is an important component in disposable diapers, training pants, feminine pads and incontinence care products.

Most recovered paper, synthetics, pulp and recycled fiber are purchased from third parties. The Corporation considers the supply of such raw materials to
be adequate to meet the needs of its businesses. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Competition

The
Corporation has several major competitors in most of its markets, some of which are larger and more diversified than the Corporation. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition



PART I

(Continued)

and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities. For additional discussion of the competitive
environment in which the Corporation conducts its business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures are directed toward new or improved personal care, tissue, wiping, and health care products and nonwoven materials. Consolidated research and development expense was $319.5 million in 2005,
$279.7 million in 2004 and $279.1 million in 2003.

Foreign Market
Risks

The Corporation operates and markets its products
globally, and its business strategy includes targeted growth in the developing and emerging markets. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of foreign market risks that may affect the Corporation’s financial results.

Environmental Matters

Total worldwide capital expenditures for voluntary environmental controls or
controls necessary to comply with legal requirements relating to the protection of the environment at the Corporation’s facilities are expected to be approximately $34 million in 2006 and $12 million in 2007. Of these amounts, approximately
$11 million in 2006 and $3 million in 2007 are expected to be spent at facilities in the U.S. For facilities outside of the U.S., capital expenditures for environmental controls are expected to be approximately $23 million in 2006 and
$9 million in 2007.

Total worldwide operating expenses
for environmental compliance are expected to be approximately $157 million in 2006 and $146 million in 2007. Operating expenses for environmental compliance with respect to U.S. facilities are expected to be approximately $74 million in
2006 and $73 million in 2007. Operating expenses for environmental compliance with respect to facilities outside the U.S. are expected to be approximately $83 million in 2006 and $73 million in 2007. Operating expenses include pollution control
equipment operation and maintenance costs, governmental payments, and research and engineering costs.

Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material effect on the Corporation’s total capital and
operating expenditures, consolidated earnings or competitive position. However, current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in the Corporation’s plans, changes in legal requirements or other factors.

Employees

In its worldwide consolidated operations, the Corporation had more than
57,000 employees as of December 31, 2005.

Item 10 of this Form 10-K identifies executive officers of the Corporation and is incorporated herein by reference.

Available Information

The Corporation makes available financial information, news releases and other information on the Corporation’s Web site at

www.kimberly-clark.com

. There is a direct link from the Web site to the Corporation’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings via the EDGAR database, where the Corporation’s annual reports



PART I

(Continued)

on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the Corporation files such reports and amendments with, or furnishes them to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Stockholders may also contact Stockholder Services, P.O. Box 612606, Dallas, Texas 75261-2606 or call 972-281-1522 to obtain a hard copy of these reports without charge.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

The following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, or in other filings by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could adversely affect the Corporation’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results.

Increased pricing pressure and intense competition for sales of the Corporation’s
products could have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial results.

The Corporation competes for customers in intensely competitive markets against well-known, branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally. Inherent risks in the Corporation’s
competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of recent consolidations of retailers and distribution channels, and competitive reaction. Some of the Corporation’s major competitors have
undergone consolidation, which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry. Such consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider
variety of products and services at more competitive prices, which could adversely affect the Corporation’s financial results. It may be necessary for the Corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and
promotions, each of which could adversely affect the Corporation’s financial results. In addition, the Corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. There is no
guarantee that the Corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the Corporation will be successful in advertising, marketing and selling its
products.

There is no guarantee that the Corporation’s efforts to
reduce costs will be successful.

The Corporation began
its Competitive Improvement Initiatives in the third quarter of 2005 to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations. See Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In addition, the Corporation anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity
gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments. If the Corporation cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions included in its Competitive Improvement Initiatives or other cost savings plans, the Corporation may
not realize all anticipated benefits. Any negative impact these initiatives have on the Corporation’s relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the
Corporation’s financial results.

Significant increases in prices for
raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the Corporation’s financial results.

Increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other
necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable



PART I

(Continued)

supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by such events as natural disasters, power outages,
labor strikes, and the like could have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial results.

Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered pulp, is used extensively in the Corporation’s tissue products and is
subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the pulp markets. Recycled fiber accounts for approximately 25 percent of the Corporation’s overall fiber requirements.

On a worldwide basis, the Corporation supplies approximately 10 percent
of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. Increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the Corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly
trail the increases in pulp prices. Derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks.

A number of the Corporation’s products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, and incontinence care products contain certain materials which are
principally derived from petroleum. These materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors. The Corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers. Significant increases
in prices for these materials could adversely affect the Corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials. Derivative
instruments have not been used to manage these risks.

Although
the Corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw
materials.

The Corporation’s manufacturing operations
utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. To ensure that it uses all forms of energy cost effectively, the Corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites. The
Corporation’s contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. The Corporation’s energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms
of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. Derivative instruments are used
to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the Corporation’s risk management policy.

The Corporation’s sales may not occur as estimated.

There is no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences, estimate sales of new products, estimate changes in population
characteristics and the acceptance of the Corporation’s products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses. As a result, the Corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales.

Difficulties in expanding globally and in developing and emerging markets (Asia, Latin
America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa) may adversely affect the Corporation’s financial results.

Because the Corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries and their products are sold in more than
150 countries, the Corporation’s results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. The Corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries.

The Corporation faces increased risks in its international operations,
including fluctuations in currency rates, adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers,



PART I

(Continued)

difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse
tax consequences. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Corporation’s financial results.

In addition, intense competition in European personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic, political and competitive environments in
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and elsewhere in Latin America and developing countries in Eastern Europe and Asia may slow the Corporation’s sales growth and earnings potential. The Corporation’s success
internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances, and there is no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to acquire or form such alliances. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
Corporation’s products will be accepted in any particular market. The Corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the U.S. dollar. Exposures, arising from transactions and commitments
denominated in non-local currencies, are systematically hedged through foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. Translation exposure for the Corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged. There can be no
assurance that the Corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations.

Pending litigation and administrative actions could have an adverse effect on the Corporation.

There is no guarantee that the Corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under
various laws, including intellectual property laws. In addition, the Corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in such actions. The costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative
actions against the Corporation cannot be determined with certainty. Although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be
as expected. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”

Changes in
laws, regulations and accounting standards could have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial results.

The Corporation is subject to federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) and
numerous related regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The Corporation has incurred substantial costs in complying with SOX and
other regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. Although the Corporation is in compliance with the laws and regulations regarding recording and reporting of financial results, there can be no assurance that
future regulations or interpretations of such regulations will not have an adverse impact on the Corporation’s financial results as compared with prior reporting periods.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Management believes that the Corporation’s production facilities are suitable for their purpose and adequate to support its businesses. The extent of utilization of individual facilities varies, but they
generally operate at or near capacity, except in certain instances such as when new products or technology are being introduced or when mills are being shut down. Various facilities contain pollution control, solid waste disposal and other equipment
which have been financed through the issuance of industrial revenue or similar bonds and are held by the Corporation under lease or installment purchase agreements.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As of December 31, 2005, the Corporation, along with many other nonaffiliated companies, was a party to lawsuits with allegations of personal injury
resulting from asbestos exposure on the defendants’ premises and allegations that the defendants manufactured, sold, distributed or installed products which cause asbestos-related lung disease. These general allegations are often made against
the Corporation without any apparent evidence or identification of a specific product or premises of the Corporation. The Corporation has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of these asbestos cases. All asbestos claims have
been tendered to the Corporation’s insurance carriers for defense and indemnity. The financial statements reflect appropriate accruals for the Corporation’s portion of the costs estimated to be incurred in connection with resolving these
claims.

The Corporation is subject to federal, state and local
environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to its business operations and is operating in compliance with, or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with, such laws and regulations. The Corporation has been named a potentially
responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites.

In management’s opinion, none of these legal proceedings nor the
Corporation’s compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to
a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products

. The Corporation adopted EITF 01-9 effective January 1, 2002, and reclassified the expected redemption value of coupons and other applicable promotional activities from expense to
a reduction in revenue, which reduced net sales $1.2 billion for 2001. The adoption of EITF 01-9 required the recording of a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2002, equal to an after-tax charge of approximately $.02 per
share, which resulted from a change in the period for recognizing the costs of coupons.

(d)

On January 1, 2002, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. Under this standard, goodwill and
intangible assets having indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests with any impairment loss recognized in the period of impairment. The Corporation recorded goodwill amortization of $94.4 million in 2001.
The effect of this amortization, net of applicable income taxes, on basic and diluted earnings per share was $.18 in 2001.

Overview of Business

The Corporation is a global health and hygiene company with manufacturing facilities in 37 countries and its products are sold in more than 150 countries. The Corporation’s products are sold under such well-known brands as Kleenex,
Scott, Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex and Depend. The Corporation has three reportable global business segments: Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and Business-to-Business. These global business segments are described in greater detail in Item 8,
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
managing its global business, the Corporation’s management believes that developing new and improved products, responding effectively to competitive challenges, obtaining and maintaining leading market shares, controlling costs, and managing
currency and commodity risks are important to the long-term success of the Corporation. The discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors.

•

Product innovation—Past results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation. The Corporation relies on its ability to develop and introduce new or improved
products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and/or maintain category leadership. In order to develop new or improved products, the technology to support those products must be acquired or developed. Research and development expenditures
are directed towards new or improved personal care, tissue and health care products and nonwoven materials.

•

Competitive environment—Past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate. We experience intense
competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label products, which are typically sold at
lower prices. We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which



PART II

(Continued)

are larger and more diversified. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and
performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities.

Aggressive competitive actions in 2004 and 2005 have required increased promotional spending to support new product introductions and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the
Corporation’s products in the market. We expect competition to continue to be intense in 2006.

•

Market shares—Achieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance. We hold number 1 or 2 share positions in more than
80 countries. Achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands.

•

Cost controls—To maintain our competitive position, we must control our manufacturing, distribution and other costs. We have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs
and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of our business segments. Our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of oil, pulp and other commodities we consume in our
manufacturing processes. Our strategic investments in information systems should also allow further cost savings through streamlining administrative activities.

•

Foreign currency and commodity risks—As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and we are also exposed to changes in
commodity prices. Our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations.

Overview of 2005 Results

During 2005, the Corporation continued to face intense competition in most of its markets. In particular, the diaper and pants categories in North America
and Europe continued to be affected by the competitive pricing pressures that began in late 2002. The businesses were also adversely affected by higher materials input costs and higher energy and related costs.

•

Net sales advanced 5.4 percent.

•

New and improved products such as Scott Extra Soft bathroom tissue, new Huggies toiletries, Pull-Ups Training Pants with Wetness Liner, WypAll X80 towels and Andrex Quilts bathroom
tissue contributed to increased sales volumes.

•

Net sales of consumer products grew almost 16 percent in the developing and emerging markets with each geographic region contributing to the increase.

•

Operating profit decreased 7.8 percent and net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 12.9 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively.

•

Higher sales volumes and cost savings of nearly $210 million did not overcome cost inflation and charges related to the strategic cost reductions included in the Corporation’s
Competitive Improvement Initiatives.

•

Cash flow from operations exceeded $2 billion.

•

The Corporation returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Results of Operations and Related Information

This section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an
understanding of 2005 results of operations. This discussion and analysis compares 2005 results to 2004, and 2004 results to 2003. Each of those discussions focuses first on consolidated results, and then the results of each reportable business
segment.

Analysis of Consolidated Net Sales

By Business Segment

By Geographic Area

Commentary:

2005 versus 2004

Consolidated net sales
increased 5.4 percent from 2004. Sales volumes rose more than 3 percent with each of the business segments contributing to the increase. Currency effects added nearly 2 percent to the increase primarily due to strengthening of the South Korean won,
the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. Net selling prices increased 1 percent offset by a reduction in net sales due to the divestiture of the pulp operations as part of the spin-off of Neenah Paper on November 30,
2004.

•

Worldwide net sales of personal care products increased 5.2 percent due to higher sales volumes, primarily in North and Latin America, and favorable currency
effects related to the previously



PART II

(Continued)

mentioned currencies and higher net selling prices in the developing and emerging markets. These positive factors were partially offset by lower net selling
prices in North America and Europe.

In
North America, net sales increased more than 1 percent resulting from 3 percent higher sales volumes reflecting higher sales of Huggies diapers, growth in child care products—GoodNites youth underpants, Pull-Ups training pants and Little
Swimmers swimpants—and incontinence brands Poise and Depend, partially offset by lower feminine care sales volumes. Lower net selling prices of about 1 percent and an unfavorable product mix tempered the effect of the overall higher sales
volumes.

Net sales in Europe declined nearly 5 percent.
Higher sales volumes for diapers were more than offset by reduced sales volumes for feminine care products. Overall net selling prices decreased about 7 percent due to continued competitive pressure. Currency effects provided a more than
1 percent favorable impact on the comparison.

In the
developing and emerging markets, net sales grew nearly 16 percent driven by about 6 percent higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects of the same magnitude. The advance in sales volume was led by double-digit growth in Latin America
with increases across the region. Asia also contributed to the sales volume increase. The favorable currency effects occurred primarily in Korea, Brazil and Australia. Net selling prices increased about 3 percent with gains in each of the
geographic regions.

•

Worldwide net sales of consumer tissue products rose 8.2 percent on the strength of increased sales volumes and net selling prices in North America, higher sales volumes in the
developing and emerging markets and favorable currency effects. These favorable impacts were tempered by lower net selling prices in Europe.

In North America, net sales advanced nearly 11 percent as higher sales volumes and higher net selling prices each contributed about 5 percent to the
improvement. A more favorable product sales mix also added about 1 percent. The higher sales volumes were driven by the introduction of Scott Extra Soft bathroom tissue in February 2005. List price increases on bathroom and facial tissue and on
towels that occurred in August 2004 resulted in the higher net selling prices. Kleenex Anti-Viral facial tissue, introduced in September 2004, was the primary leader in the improved product mix.

In Europe, net sales decreased nearly 2 percent principally due to over 3
percent lower net selling prices reflecting continuing competitive pressures. Sales volumes were even with the prior year and currency provided about a 1 percent favorable effect.

In the developing and emerging markets, net sales increased approximately 16 percent primarily due to about 8 percent higher
sales volumes and approximately 6 percent favorable currency effects. Korea, Australia and Brazil were the most significant contributors to both sales volume and currency gains.

•

Worldwide net sales for business-to-business products decreased 3.4 percent. The divestiture of the pulp operations included in the Neenah Paper spin-off reduced net sales by about
8 percent. Overall sales volumes increased approximately 3 percent as both K-C Professional and Health Care reported gains of about that same percent. Favorable currency effects and higher net selling prices, principally in
K-C Professional’s North America operations, each added about 1 percent improvement to the comparison.



PART II

(Continued)

2004 versus 2003

Consolidated net sales
increased 7.5 percent from 2003. Sales volumes advanced approximately 5 percent with contributions from each of the business segments. About 1 percentage point of the increase in sales volumes was due to the consolidation, in August 2003, of
Klabin Kimberly S.A. (“Klabin”), a former equity affiliate and Brazil’s largest tissue manufacturer. Currency effects added more than 3 percent to the increase primarily due to strengthening of the euro, British pound, and Australian
and Canadian dollars. Slightly lower net selling prices were offset by a more favorable product mix.

•

Worldwide personal care net sales rose 5.7 percent due to higher sales volumes, mainly in North America, favorable currency effects in Europe and Australia and better product mix in
Central America, partially offset by lower net selling prices primarily in North America and Europe.

In North America, net sales increased nearly 5 percent driven by a more than 6 percent sales volume increase reflecting higher sales of Huggies diapers
and double-digit growth for child care products—GoodNites youth underpants, Pull-Ups training pants, Little Swimmers swimpants—and incontinence brands Poise and Depend. Net selling prices declined about 2 percent primarily in response to
competitive activity. Favorable Canadian dollar exchange rate effects also contributed to the increase in net sales. The increased child care volumes are due to strong category growth through increased consumer usage. Market share for feminine care
products declined as a result of significant competitive activity.

Net sales in Europe were even with last year as 10 percent favorable currency effects were offset by almost 7 percent lower sales volumes and a 3 percent reduction in net selling prices. Lower sales volumes for diapers and feminine care
products were a result of aggressive competitive price reductions and promotion spending. This more than offset higher sales volumes for child and adult care products. Except for child care, which benefited from a prior year price increase, net
selling prices declined due to competitive activity.

In the
developing and emerging markets, net sales increased about 10 percent with higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects each contributing about 5 percent, while improved product mix essentially offset lower net selling prices. Advances
in sales volumes and favorable currency were realized in both Korea and Australia. Latin America and Israel also recorded higher sales volumes.

•

Worldwide consumer tissue net sales increased 5.9 percent on higher sales volumes, primarily in North America, the consolidation of Klabin and favorable currency effects,
principally in Europe, partially offset by lower intersegment sales. Net selling prices were even with the prior year.

In North America, net sales increased almost 4 percent with higher sales volumes and net selling prices each contributing about 2 percent. The higher
sales volumes were led by increased sales for Scott bathroom tissue and private label, partially offset by lower sales volumes for Kleenex facial tissue. In the third quarter of 2004, the Corporation implemented list price increases on its bathroom
and facial tissue products and on paper towels. These price increases along with a reduction in trade promotion



PART II

(Continued)

spending in the fourth quarter contributed to the higher net selling prices. In facial tissue products, the Corporation’s main competitor did not match
the Corporation’s price increases in some product codes, which is reflected in the Corporation’s lower market share for the category. The third quarter 2004 introduction of Kleenex Anti-Viral facial tissue contributed to a slight increase
in net sales due to product mix.

In Europe, net sales
increased nearly 9 percent because of an almost 11 percent favorable effect from currency tempered by lower net selling prices that reflect the continuing competitive marketplace. Sales volumes were nearly 1 percent higher primarily due to increased
sales of Andrex products in the United Kingdom.

In the
developing and emerging markets, net sales advanced approximately 20 percent on a sales volume increase of more than 11 percent, of which about 7 percentage points was attributable to the consolidation of Klabin, favorable currency effects of
almost 5 percent, primarily in Australia, and a favorable product mix.

•

Worldwide net sales for products in the business-to-business segment increased 13.8 percent driven by nearly 7 percent higher sales volumes, more than 3 percent favorable currency
effects and higher intersegment sales, tempered by less than 2 percent lower net selling prices. Sales volume growth was led by more than an 8 percent volume increase in global health care.

Professional products achieved more than 5 percent higher sales volumes and
higher sales of nonwoven products provided additional benefit. The favorable currency effects were principally due to Europe. Despite price increases in the fourth quarter for professional products in North America, net selling prices for the year
declined due to price erosion in contract business across the segment.

Analysis of Consolidated Operating Profit

By Business Segment

By Geographic Area

Note:

Corporate & Other for 2005 includes $228.6 million of costs for the Competitive Improvement Initiatives discussed below and other expenses not associated with the business
segments or geographic areas.



PART II

(Continued)

Commentary:

2005 versus 2004

(a)

Includes the benefit of cost savings achieved, net of increased costs for marketing and research.

(b)

Includes costs aggregating $228.6 million for the Competitive Improvement Initiatives.

(c)

Operating losses from divested pulp operations were included in 2004.

Consolidated operating profit decreased 7.8 percent. Significant factors that negatively affected operating profit were approximately $229 million of
charges related to the Competitive Improvement Initiatives that are not included in the business segments (as discussed later in this MD&A and in Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), cost inflation of about $400 million
and higher marketing, research and general expenses. Those factors were partially offset by gross cost savings of nearly $210 million, increased sales volumes and higher net selling prices. Operating profit as a percent of net sales declined to 14.5
percent from 16.6 percent for 2004.

•

Operating profit for personal care products decreased .9 percent. Cost savings, higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects were offset by materials cost
inflation—particularly for polymer resins and superabsorbents, lower net selling prices and increased costs for marketing and research activities. The year-over-year change in operating profit was also affected by about $37 million of
costs in 2004 to improve the efficiency of the Corporation’s diaper operations.

Operating profit in North America declined about 3 percent as materials cost inflation, lower net selling prices and higher distribution costs more than
offset cost savings and the higher sales volumes. In Europe, operating profit decreased primarily due to the lower net selling prices. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased nearly 16 percent due to the higher sales
volumes, higher net selling prices and favorable currency effects, tempered by higher marketing and administrative costs.

•

Operating profit for consumer tissue products was essentially even with last year, an increase of .3 percent. The higher net selling prices, higher sales volumes and cost
savings were offset by cost inflation for materials, energy and distribution, and higher marketing and research expenses.

In North America, operating profit grew almost 8 percent because the higher net selling prices and increased sales volumes more than offset the cost
inflation. Operating profit in Europe decreased principally due to the effects of the competitive lower net selling prices. In the developing and emerging markets, operating profit advanced approximately 19 percent on the strength of the higher
sales volumes and a favorable product mix.

•

Operating profit for business-to-business products increased 2.5 percent. The higher sales volumes and higher net selling prices combined with cost savings and the absence of
operating losses related to the divested pulp operations allowed the segment to overcome materials and energy related cost inflation.



PART II

(Continued)

Competitive Improvement Initiatives

In July 2005, the Corporation authorized the initial phase of a multi-year
program to further improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and strategic cost reductions aimed at streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations, primarily in North America and
Europe (the “Competitive Improvement Initiatives”).

The Competitive Improvement Initiatives commenced in the third quarter of 2005 and are expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2008. Based on current estimates, the strategic cost reductions are expected to result in
cumulative charges of approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion before tax ($625-$775 million after tax) over that three and one-half year period. These reductions are expected to yield annual pretax savings that increase to $300-$350 million
by 2009. Continuous productivity gains over the last several years along with investments in state-of-the-art manufacturing capacity are enabling the Corporation to consolidate production at fewer facilities. Cash costs related to the sale, closure
or streamlining of operations, relocation of equipment, severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 45 percent of the charges. Noncash charges will consist primarily of incremental depreciation and amortization and asset
write downs.

By the end of 2008, it is anticipated there will
be a net workforce reduction of about 10 percent, or approximately 6,000 employees. As of December 31, 2005, a net workforce reduction of more than 400 had occurred. Approximately 20 manufacturing facilities, or 17 percent of the
Corporation’s worldwide total, are expected to be sold or closed and an additional 4 facilities are expected to be streamlined. There is a particular focus on Europe, aimed at improving business results in the region. The Corporation intends to
consolidate and streamline manufacturing facilities, further improve operating efficiencies, and reduce selling, general and administrative expenses while reinvesting in key growth opportunities there. As of December 31, 2005, charges have been
recorded related to the initiatives for 14 facilities.

The
initial phase of the Competitive Improvement Initiatives will occur between 2005 and mid-2007 and will include the sale, closure or streamlining of 15 of the facilities and the expansion of 3 others. After-tax charges in connection with these
projects are expected to total approximately $355-$390 million. The Corporation anticipates that the pretax charges for the initial phase of the strategic cost reductions will be incurred for the following categories at the indicated estimated
amounts: workforce reduction costs (approximately $150 million); incremental depreciation and amortization (approximately $225 million); asset impairments (approximately $100 million); and other associated costs (approximately
$55 million). During 2005, the Corporation incurred charges totaling $228.6 million in connection with the initiatives; $167.6 million after tax.

The strategic cost reductions included in the Competitive Improvement Initiatives are corporate decisions and are not included in the business
segments’ operating profit performance. See Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2005 costs of the strategic cost reductions by business segment and geographic area. Certain actions yet to be announced for the
strategic cost reductions are still being evaluated. Accordingly, it is difficult at this time to estimate the total costs to be incurred by business segment over the life of the initiatives. The 2005 charges have been recorded in Cost of Products
Sold ($201.6 million) and Marketing, Research and General Expenses ($27.0 million).

Other Income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net decreased compared with 2004 primarily due to income in 2005 of approximately $22 million from an insurance claim for partial recovery of damages related to a fire in 2004 at a facility in Europe. Increased
currency transaction losses in 2005 were mitigated by lower write-offs related to the Corporation’s investments in historic real estate restoration projects.



PART II

(Continued)

2004 versus 2003

(a)

Includes the benefits of cost savings programs.

Consolidated operating profit increased 7.5 percent as the higher sales volumes, about $160 million of benefit from cost savings programs and total
favorable currency effects of over $70 million more than offset the lower net selling prices, higher fiber costs and increased energy and distribution expenses. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 16.6 percent, the same as 2003.

•

Operating profit for personal care products increased 2.6 percent. The higher sales volumes, more than $85 million in cost savings and favorable currency effects, primarily in
Australia and Canada, were partially offset by the lower net selling prices, higher raw material and distribution costs, increased advertising expenses, and costs associated with a plan to streamline diaper operations. Primarily as a result of
significant productivity gains, the Corporation had available diaper manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe. Therefore, the Corporation executed a plan to cease diaper manufacturing and scale back distribution operations at its facility
in New Milford, Connecticut. Some production capacity was also redeployed from the Barton-upon-Humber facility in the U.K. Diaper machines from these locations will now support growth in other markets, thereby reducing the capital spending required
for this business. These steps are consistent with the Corporation’s strategies to drive growth in developing and emerging markets and improve its cost structure in North America and Europe.

Costs to implement the infant care plan described above total approximately
$40 million before tax, including about $37 million recorded in 2004. The balance of the plan costs were recorded in 2005 as they were incurred. Of the total 2004 cost, approximately $10 million was for employee severance recorded at the time
employees were notified of their termination benefits, about $3 million for other cash costs, principally for equipment removal, and $24 million for asset write-offs primarily related to the original equipment installation costs. These costs
were recorded in Cost of Products Sold.

Operating profit in
North America increased about 1 percent as the benefits of the higher sales volumes and cost savings programs were partially offset by the lower selling prices, costs of the infant care plan and higher advertising and distribution costs. In Europe,
operating profit declined because of the negative impacts of the competitive environment on selling prices and sales volumes. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased over 7 percent, principally due to higher sales volumes
and favorable currency effects, partially offset by higher marketing expenses.

•

Operating profit for consumer tissue products improved 10.3 percent driven by cost savings of almost $60 million, favorable currency effects of about $25 million
and lower marketing expenses tempered by approximately $45 million of higher fiber costs, higher other raw material and energy costs and increased distribution expense. In North America, operating profit grew nearly 6 percent because of the
higher sales volumes and net selling prices, cost savings, and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by higher fiber costs and increased costs for energy and distribution. Operating profit in Europe advanced more than 8 percent principally on
the strength of cost savings and favorable currency,



PART II

(Continued)

tempered by the lower net selling prices. In the developing and emerging markets, operating profit rose more than 20 percent primarily due to favorable
product mix, the higher sales volumes and currency effects.

•

Operating profit for business-to-business products increased 8.9 percent. In addition to the higher sales volumes and favorable currency, the segment benefited from more than $14
million in cost savings, primarily in the professional business, and lower start-up costs compared to 2003. These gains were tempered by the lower net selling prices, higher fiber costs, increased other raw materials costs, higher energy and
distribution expenses, and higher general and administrative costs. Our professional and global health care businesses both had higher sales volumes in North America and Europe.

•

Other income (expense), net in 2003 included charges of $34 million consisting of $15.6 million for a legal judgment in Europe and $18.4 million for the costs associated
with the redemption of $400 million of debentures; and nearly $20 million for charges to write-off an equity investment in an historic restoration project and the write-down of a nonstrategic facility outside of North America.

•

In 2004 Corporate & Other included the write-off of a consolidated investment in an historic renovation project, higher corporate charitable contributions and increased
general business taxes.

Additional Income
Statement Commentary

Synthetic Fuel Partnerships

As described in Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the Corporation owns minority interests in two synthetic fuel partnerships. Pretax losses from participation in these partnerships are recorded as nonoperating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. The
$20.6 million increase in these losses in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the Corporation’s full-year participation in one of the partnerships versus a partial year in 2004. The Corporation’s income tax provision was
lowered by $34.5 million as a result of increased income tax credits and tax benefits of the higher nonoperating expenses. The continuing rise in crude oil prices may initiate the phase out of the synthetic fuel tax credits derived from production
of the synthetic fuels, and if the credits are phased out, the partnerships are expected to cease production. Based on year-to-date prices of crude oil and expected pricing for the balance of 2006, the Corporation anticipates that it could receive
only modest benefits, if any, from these partnerships in 2006.

2005 versus 2004

•

Interest expense increased due to both a higher average level of debt and higher interest rates.

•

The Corporation’s effective income tax rate was 22.3 percent in 2005 compared with 22.0 percent in 2004. The most significant factors causing the increase were the taxes
on the dividends received under the American Jobs Creation Act partially offset by the increased synthetic fuel credits.

•

The Corporation’s share of net income of equity affiliates increased $11.8 million from 2004 primarily due to higher earnings at Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.
(“KCM”). KCM’s results were driven by a nearly 16 percent increase in sales due to volume growth in its consumer businesses and higher selling prices. However, its earnings growth was tempered by currency losses.

•

Minority owners’ share of subsidiaries’ net income increased $12.6 million primarily due to higher earnings of companies in the developing and emerging markets.

•

As a result of the Corporation’s share repurchase program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2005 results by $.14 per share.



PART II

(Continued)

2004 versus 2003

•

Interest expense decreased primarily because of a lower average level of debt, partially offset by higher interest rates.

•

The Corporation’s effective income tax rate was 22.0 percent in 2004 compared with 23.3 percent in 2003. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the incremental
benefits from the synthetic fuel partnership entered into in 2004.

•

The Corporation’s share of net income of equity affiliates increased $17.8 million from 2003 primarily due to higher earnings at KCM. Its results were boosted by a sales gain
of more than 10 percent, with continued double-digit volume growth in its consumer businesses and higher selling prices.

•

Minority owners’ share of subsidiaries’ net income increased $18.3 million primarily due to higher returns on the preferred securities held by the minority interest in the
Corporation’s consolidated foreign financing subsidiary. (See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail regarding these securities.)

•

Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes decreased 41.1 percent due to transaction costs for the Spin-off and to a lesser extent because 2004 includes 11
months’ results versus 12 months in 2003 as the Spin-off occurred on November 30, 2004.

•

As a result of the Corporation’s share repurchase program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2004 results by $.07 per share.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

(a)

Capital is total debt and preferred securities plus stockholders’ equity and minority owners’ interest in subsidiaries.

Cash Flow Commentary:

•

Cash provided by operations decreased $414.4 million, or 15.2 percent, primarily due to an increased investment in working capital and higher income tax payments, partially offset
by lower cash contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan.



PART II

(Continued)

Contractual Obligations:

The following table presents the Corporation’s total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or
determinable.

Obligations
Commentary:

•

Projected interest payments for variable-rate debt were calculated based on the outstanding principal amounts and prevailing market rates as of December 31, 2005.

•

The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily pulp and utilities. Although the Corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above
operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, management believes the Corporation’s exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.

•

The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts the Corporation anticipates will become payable within the next year for goods and services it has negotiated for
delivery.

The above table does not include
future payments that the Corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. Based upon those projections,
the Corporation anticipates making annual payments for these obligations within a range from nearly $85 million in 2006 to more than $95 million by 2015.

Deferred taxes, minority interest and payments related to pension plans are also not included in the table.

A consolidated financing subsidiary has issued preferred securities that are
in substance perpetual and are callable by the subsidiary in November 2008 and each 20-year anniversary thereafter. Management currently anticipates that these securities will not be called in November 2008, the next call date, and therefore they
are not included in the above table. (See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail regarding these securities.)

Investing Commentary:

•

During 2005, the Corporation’s capital spending of $709.6 million, which is equal to 4.5 percent of net sales, was below the long-term targeted range of 5 percent to 6 percent
of net sales. The lower capital spending in 2005 resulted primarily from productivity gains and leveraging the global scale of existing production capacity. Management believes the capital spending target range of 5 percent to 6 percent of net sales
is appropriate.

•

The net decrease in time deposits in 2005 was primarily due to the Korean business utilizing their investments to pay dividends and to fund their pension plan.



PART II

(Continued)

Financing Commentary:

•

At December 31, 2005, total debt and preferred securities was $4.6 billion, compared with $4.2 billion last year end.

•

During the third quarter of 2005, the Corporation issued $300 million of 4.875% Notes due August 15, 2015. Proceeds from the sale of the notes were used for general
corporate purposes and for the reduction of existing indebtedness, including portions of the Corporation’s outstanding commercial paper program.

•

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation had fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements related to a $500 million 5.0% Note that matures on August 15, 2013.

•

There were no changes in the Corporation’s credit ratings in 2005. The Corporation’s long-term debt securities have an Aa2 rating from Moody’s Investor Service and an
AA- from Standard & Poor’s. Its commercial paper is rated in the top category.

•

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation had $1.5 billion of revolving credit facilities. These facilities, unused at December 31, 2005, permit borrowing at competitive
interest rates and are available for general corporate purposes, including backup for commercial paper borrowings. The Corporation pays commitment fees on the unused portion but may cancel the facilities without penalty at any time prior to their
expiration. These facilities expire in June 2010. The Corporation anticipates that these facilities will be renewed when they expire.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2005, a three-year bank credit facility was established for the purpose of funding American Jobs Creation Act dividends. The Corporation has the option
to repay the facility in any month until the facility expires in October 2008. Currently, the Corporation plans to repay this obligation by the end of 2006; therefore, it has been classified as short-term debt. The facility is denominated in
Australian dollars and euros, and interest charges are based on the prevailing local short-term interest rates plus 12.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $308 million was outstanding. No additional draws against the
facility are permitted.

•

For the full year 2005, the Corporation repurchased approximately 24.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion, including 8.6 million
shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of approximately $500 million. The monthly detail of share repurchases for the fourth quarter of 2005 is included in Part II Item 5 of this Form 10-K. On September 15, 2005, the
Corporation’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 50 million shares of the Corporation’s common stock during the next several years.

Management believes that the Corporation’s ability to generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue
short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock and other needs in the foreseeable future.

Variable Interest Entities

The Corporation has variable interests in the following financing and real estate entities and in the synthetic fuel partnerships described above.

Financing Entities

As explained in more detail in Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the Corporation holds a significant variable interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize long-term notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets, which were sold in 1999
and 1989 to



PART II

(Continued)

nonaffiliated buyers. These sales involved notes receivable, which are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks, that
have an aggregate face value of $617 million.

In 1999 the
Corporation transferred the notes received from the 1999 sale to a noncontrolled financing entity, and in 2000 it transferred the notes received from the 1989 sale to another noncontrolled financing entity. The Corporation has minority voting
interests in each of the financing entities (collectively, the “Financing Entities”). The transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the Financing Entities were made at fair value, were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in
no gain or loss. In conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets, the Financing Entities became obligated for $617 million in third-party debt financing. A nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments
in each of the Financing Entities, has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the Financing Entities. The Corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating
$662 million and intercompany preferred stock of $50 million to the Financing Entities, which serve as secondary collateral for the third-party lending arrangements. In the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that
provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit, the Corporation could experience a maximum loss of $617 million under these arrangements.

The Corporation has not consolidated the Financing Entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity. Rather, it will continue to
account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting. The Corporation retains equity interests in the Financing Entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes. As a result,
the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the Corporation’s equity interests in the Financing Entities for financial reporting purposes.

See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Corporation’s Luxembourg-based financing subsidiary, which
is consolidated because the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity.

Real Estate Entities

As explained in greater detail in Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation participates in the U.S. affordable and historic renovation real estate markets through (i) partnership arrangements in
which it is a limited partner, (ii) limited liability companies (“LLCs”) in which it is a nonmanaging member and (iii) investments in various funds in which the Corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors. These variable
interest entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects.

Effective March 31, 2004, the Corporation adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities—an Interpretation of ARB 51

(“FIN 46R”), for these real estate entities. Adoption of FIN 46R required the Corporation to consolidate ten apartment projects and two hotels because it was the primary beneficiary of each of
these real estate ventures. Subsequently, three of the apartments and the two hotels became wholly-owned by the Corporation. For the entities that remain consolidated under FIN 46R, the carrying amount of the assets that serve as collateral for
$42.7 million of obligations of these ventures was $47.0 million at December 31, 2005.

The Corporation is not the primary beneficiary for the remainder of the real estate entities and has not consolidated them. These entities are accounted
for by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2005, total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was $255.8 million. A total of $19.7 million of the permanent
financing debt is guaranteed by the Corporation. Except for the guaranteed portion, permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is



PART II

(Continued)

nonrecourse to the Corporation. From time to time, temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the Corporation. In general, the Corporation’s interim
financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained. At December 31, 2005, $34.3 million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the
Corporation.

If the Corporation’s investments in its
nonconsolidated real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts, a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2005, this recapture risk is estimated to be
$34.5 million. The Corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period, nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need.
Accordingly, the recapture risk is considered to be remote.

At
December 31, 2005, the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure for its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be $109.4 million and is comprised of its net equity in these entities of $20.9 million, its permanent financing
guarantees of $19.7 million, its interim financing guarantees of $34.3 million and the income tax credit recapture risk of $34.5 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting policies used by management in the
preparation of the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management
with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals, pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, retained insurable risks, excess and obsolete inventory, allowance
for doubtful accounts, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long-lived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, deferred tax
assets and potential income tax assessments, and loss contingencies. The Corporation’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Promotion and Rebate Accruals

Among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of
the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the Corporation and its trade customers. Rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors
have sold to specific customers. Generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product
categories. Estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred, but unpaid, are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within
the promotional programs. Settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing
programs, temporary price reductions, favorable end of aisle or in-store product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the Corporation’s products. Promotion accruals as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were
$235.3 million and $263.3 million, respectively. Rebate accruals as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $160.2 million and $163.0 million, respectively.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

The Corporation and its subsidiaries in North America and the United Kingdom
have defined benefit pension plans (the “Principal Plans”) and/or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries,
termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated
benefit obligation (“ABO”). Subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits, any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years.

Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not
funded. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in such countries.

Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was $156.8
million in 2005 compared with $154.8 million for 2004. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund
assets used to calculate pension expense was 8.29 percent in 2005 compared with 8.32 percent in 2004 and will be 8.28 percent in 2006. The expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors,
including input from the Corporation’s pension investment consultants and projected long-term returns of broad equity and bond indices. The U.S. plan’s historical 10-year and 15-year compounded annual returns of 9.36 percent and 10.28
percent, respectively, which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices, were also considered. On average, the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the Principal Plans are anticipated to generate annual
long-term rates of return of at least 8.5 percent. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets in the Principal Plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers, with expected long-term
rates of return of approximately 10 percent, and 30 percent with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of about 6 percent. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted
allocation when considered appropriate. Also, when deemed appropriate, hedging strategies are executed using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level.
This hedging strategy was last executed for 2003. No hedging instruments are currently in place. Long-term rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary.

Pension expense is determined on the fair value of assets rather than a
calculated value that averages gains and losses (“Calculated Value”) over a period of years. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return
based on the fair value of assets. The variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets are recognized in pension expense more rapidly than they would be if a Calculated Value was used for plan assets. As of
December 31, 2005, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately $1.7 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by
(i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, or (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial
gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” determined under SFAS No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

.

The discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of the
Corporation’s future U.S. pension obligations at December 31, 2005 was based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years. Each year’s expected
future benefit



PART II

(Continued)

payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rate for U.S. pension
obligations. For the non-U.S. Principal Plans, discount rates are established using the long-term local government bond rates increased by the interest rate spread between the U.S. discount rate and long-term U.S. government bond rates. The
weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans decreased to 5.54 percent at December 31, 2005 from 5.77 percent at December 31, 2004.

Consolidated pension expense is estimated to approximate $165 million in 2006. This estimate reflects the effect of the
actuarial losses and is based on an expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets in the Principal Plans of 8.5 percent, a weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans of 5.54 percent and various other assumptions. Pension
expense beyond 2006 will depend on future investment performance, the Corporation’s contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans. The estimated expense
for 2006 does not include any potential effects related to subsequent phase projects under the Competitive Improvement Initiatives that have not yet been authorized.

If the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the Principal Plans was lowered by 0.25 percent, our annual
pension expense would increase by approximately $9 million. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, annual pension expense would increase by approximately $14 million and the December 31, 2005 minimum
pension liability would increase by about $158 million.

The fair value of the assets in the Corporation’s defined benefit plans was $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. Lower discount rates have caused the projected benefit
obligations (the “PBO”) of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. Primarily due to the lower
discount rates, the ABO of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about $1.0 billion and about $.9 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004, respectively. On a consolidated basis, the Corporation contributed about $117
million to pension trusts in 2005 compared with $200 million in 2004. In addition, the Corporation made direct benefit payments of $11.9 million in 2005 compared to $21.4 million in 2004. While the Corporation is not required to make a
contribution in 2006 to the U.S. plan, the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated. The Corporation currently anticipates contributing about $80 million to its pension plans outside the U.S. in 2006.

The discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is
identical to the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation. The discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the Corporation’s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting
used in the calculation of the two weighted-average discount rates.

Other Postretirement Benefits

Substantially all North American retirees and employees are covered by health care and life insurance benefit plans. Certain benefits are based on years of service and/or age at retirement. The plans are principally noncontributory for
employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 and contributory for most employees who retire after 1992, except that the Corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003. These plans are not funded until the year in
which payments are made for benefit claims.

The
Corporation’s contributions to the plans were $66.5 million in 2005 compared with $59.4 million in 2004. The increase was due to a change in the timing of contributions to the plans to better align with the payments of benefit claims. The
determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans are discussed in the pension benefit section above. If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, our annual other
postretirement benefit expense would increase by approximately $1 million and the December 31, 2005 benefit liability would increase by about $21 million.



PART II

(Continued)

Prior to 2004, certain U.S. plans limited the Corporation’s cost of future annual per capita
retiree medical benefits to no more than 200 percent of the 1992 annual per capita cost. These plans reached this limitation (the “Cap”) and were amended during 2003. Among other things, the amendments index the Cap by 3 percent annually
beginning in 2005 for certain employees retiring on or before April 1, 2004 and limit the Corporation’s future cost for retiree health care benefits to a defined fixed per capita cost for certain employees retiring after April 1,
2004.

The health care cost trend rate is based on a
combination of inputs including the Corporation’s recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. The annual
increase in the consolidated weighted-average health care cost trend rate is expected to be 9.91 percent in 2006, 8.86 percent in 2007 and to gradually decline to 5.19 percent in 2011 and thereafter. See Item 8, Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate.

Retained Insurable Risks

Selected insurable risks are retained, primarily those related to property damage, workers’ compensation, and product, automobile and premises
liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events, principally related to workers’ compensation and automobile liability, are
based upon loss development factors provided to the Corporation by external insurance brokers and are not discounted.

Excess and Obsolete Inventory

All excess, obsolete, damaged or off-quality inventories including raw materials, in-process, finished goods, and spare parts are required to be
adequately reserved for or to be disposed of. This process requires an ongoing tracking of the aging of inventories to be reviewed in conjunction with current marketing plans to ensure that any excess or obsolete inventories are identified on a
timely basis. This process also requires judgments be made about the salability of existing stock in relation to sales projections. The evaluation of the adequacy of provision for obsolete and excess inventories is performed on at least a quarterly
basis. No provisions for future obsolescence, damage or off-quality inventories are made.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Corporation’s best estimate of the accounts receivable that will not be collected. The estimate is based on, among other things, historical collection experience, a review of the
current aging status of customer receivables, and a review of specific information for those customers that are deemed to be higher risk. At the time the Corporation becomes aware of a customer whose continued operating success is questionable,
collection of their receivable balance is closely monitored and the customer may be required to prepay for shipments. If a customer enters a bankruptcy action, the progress of that action is monitored to determine when and if an additional provision
for non-collectibility is warranted. The adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated on at least a quarterly basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $35.8 million and $42.5 million,
respectively, and the write-off of uncollectible accounts was $15.0 million and $13.6 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Property and Depreciation

Estimating the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment, and actual lives may differ from these
estimates. Changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,



PART II

(Continued)

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such
long-lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices
and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset
impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on
the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. The determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk
free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value.

The
estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans, including the Competitive Improvement Initiatives, and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions.
The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. For example, if the Corporation’s products fail to achieve volume and
pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized, then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and additional impairment charges may be recognized.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of
the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Impairment testing is conducted at
the operating segment level of the Corporation’s businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment. The determination of fair value requires significant management judgment
including estimating future sales volumes, selling prices and costs, changes in working capital, investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in
assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices and costs are also tested. If the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value, a possible impairment would be indicated. If a possible impairment is indicated, the
implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment
charge would be recorded. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, product changes and other external events
may require more frequent assessments. The Corporation’s annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and it has been determined that none of its $2.7 billion of goodwill is impaired.

The Corporation has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. At
December 31, 2005, the Corporation has other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately $277 million and a net carrying amount of about $164 million. These intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives
and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss
would be indicated. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows. Judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of
intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives. The factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above.



PART II

(Continued)

Primary Beneficiary Determination of Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”)

The determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest
entities under FIN 46R requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each VIE using a computer simulation model and determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values. Estimating the probable future cash flows of each
VIE requires the exercise of significant management judgment. The resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each VIE in accordance with their beneficial interests. The participant that is allocated the
majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE under FIN 46R.

Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments

As of December 31, 2005, the Corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit
carryforwards totaling $789.4 million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of $474.0 million, thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $315.4 million. As of December 31, 2004, the net deferred tax
asset was $267.1 million. These income tax losses and credits are in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions, in the U.S. for excess foreign tax credits and in certain states within the U.S. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these
deferred tax assets, the Corporation considers many factors, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is
recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

As of December 31, 2005, United States income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $3.7 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 23,

Accounting for Income
Taxes, Special Areas.

These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. However, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to the Corporation or a U.S. affiliate, or if the
Corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. We periodically determine whether our non-U.S. subsidiaries will
invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate. See Item 8, Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of previously unremitted earnings that were repatriated in 2005 under
the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.

The
Corporation accrues liabilities in current income taxes for potential assessments which at December 31, 2005 and 2004 aggregated to $268.8 million and $356.4 million, respectively. The accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a
variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the
statute of limitations. The Corporation’s U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2003. IRS assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 1998. Refund actions are pending with the IRS Examination Division or Appeals
Office for the years 1993 through 1998. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results
of operations or liquidity.

Loss Contingencies

The outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings
and claims brought against the Corporation are subject to uncertainty. SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

requires that an estimated loss contingency be accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been
impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a



PART II

(Continued)

reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation of the probability of an unfavorable
outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate. Changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies.

Legal Matters

See Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters.

Environmental Matters

The Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the
provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, in management’s opinion, is
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Business Outlook

Under its Global Business Plan, the Corporation expects net sales to continue to benefit from new and improved products and
strong growth in developing and emerging markets. The Corporation is also confident that it will generate additional cost savings in 2006 and beyond. And while it is anticipated that inflationary pressures will continue, the Corporation is intent on
delivering sustainable growth in net income. The Corporation will also remain focused on increasing cash flow from operations and further improving return on invested capital.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K or related documents, a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference, concerning, among other things,
the business outlook, including new product introductions, cost savings, anticipated costs and savings related to the Competitive Improvement Initiatives, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, contingencies and contemplated
transactions of the Corporation, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the
Corporation. There can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the Corporation’s results will be as estimated.

The assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future
cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside the control of the Corporation, including the prices and availability of the Corporation’s raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices or
advertising and promotion expenses for the Corporation’s products, energy costs, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the Corporation does business, could impact the
realization of such estimates.

The factors described under
Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K, or in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, among others, could cause the Corporation’s future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements
made by, or on behalf of, the Corporation. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As a multinational enterprise, the Corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
prices. A variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and
not for speculation or trading. All foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions. The Corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements
with a positive fair value at the reporting date. Credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties.

Presented below is a description of the Corporation’s most significant risks (foreign currency risk, interest rate risk
and commodity price risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. These analyses reflect management’s view of changes which are reasonably possible
to occur over a one-year period.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of
foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. The use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or
in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Prior to 2004, foreign currency risk was managed by the selective, rather than the systematic, use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. Management does not
foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future.

Foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. An annual test is performed to
quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the Corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current
year-end. The balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. The results of this sensitivity test
are presented in the following paragraph.

As of
December 31, 2005, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of
approximately $63 million. These hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the December 31, 2005 rates and the assumed rates. In the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these
assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the Corporation’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The translation of the balance sheets of non-U.S. operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-U.S. operations into U.S.
dollars. These translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments (“UTA”) within stockholders’ equity. The hypothetical increase in UTA is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-U.S.
operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. The results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph.

As of December 31, 2005, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of the
Corporation’s foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced

stockholders’ equity by approximately $528 million. These hypothetical adjustments in UTA are based on the difference between the December 31, 2005
exchange rates and the assumed rates. In the view of management, the above UTA adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the Corporation’s consolidated financial position.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of
variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. The objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. At December 31, 2005, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately
51 percent variable-rate debt and 49 percent fixed-rate debt. The strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and is designed to balance the
Corporation’s cost of financing with its interest rate risk.

Two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the Corporation’s financial position or future results of operations. Both tests are based on consolidated debt levels
at the time of the test. The first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. Interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market
interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. With respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2005, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about
$91 million. The second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the Corporation’s current level of variable-rate debt. With respect to commercial paper and
other variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows.

Commodity Price Risk

The Corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. Selling prices of tissue products are
influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. On a worldwide basis, the Corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations.
As previously discussed under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices.
Derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks.

In addition, the Corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. Derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of this risk in accordance with the
Corporation’s risk management policy.

Management does not
believe that these risks are material to the Corporation’s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.     Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kimberly-Clark
Corporation and all subsidiaries in which it has a controlling financial interest (the “Corporation”). All significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.

On November 30, 2004, the Corporation completed the spin-off of Neenah
Paper, Inc. (“Neenah Paper”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that owned the Corporation’s Canadian pulp business and its U.S. fine paper and technical paper businesses (the “Spin-off”). The Spin-off was accomplished by a
distribution of all of the shares of Neenah Paper’s common stock to the Corporation’s stockholders, and no gain or loss was recorded by the Corporation. Holders of common stock received a dividend of one share of Neenah Paper for every 33
shares of stock held. Based on a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service, receipt of the Neenah Paper shares in the distribution was tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the Spin-off, the
Corporation’s 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Income Statements and Cash Flow Statements and related disclosures present the fine paper and technical paper businesses as discontinued operations, which is discussed in Note 2. The 2003
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income and related disclosures are presented on their historic basis, and unless otherwise noted, the information contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
relates to the Corporation’s continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, consumer and
trade promotion and rebate accruals, pension benefits, other post-employment benefits, retained insurable risks, excess and obsolete inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows
associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long-lived assets and for determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments, and loss contingencies.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are short-term investments with an original maturity date
of three months or less.

Inventories and Distribution Costs

For financial reporting purposes, most U.S. inventories
are valued at the lower of cost, using the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method or market. The balance of the U.S. inventories and inventories of consolidated operations outside the U.S. are valued at the lower of cost, using either the First-In,
First-Out (FIFO) or weighted-average cost methods, or market. Distribution costs are classified as Cost of Products Sold.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 151,

Inventory
Costs—an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4

. SFAS 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs and spoilage. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory be based on the normal capacity of production facilities. Adoption of SFAS 151 did not have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Available-for-Sale Securities

Available-for-sale securities, consisting of debt securities issued by non-U.S. governments and unaffiliated corporations,
are carried at market value. Securities with maturity dates of one year or less are included in other current assets and were $12.8 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Securities with maturity dates
greater than one year are included in other assets and were $2.0 million and $13.0 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The securities are held by the Corporation’s consolidated foreign financing subsidiary described
in Note 6. Unrealized holding gains or losses on these securities are recorded in other comprehensive income until realized. No significant gains or losses were recognized in income for any of the three years ended December 31, 2005.

Property and Depreciation

For financial reporting purposes, property, plant and equipment are stated
at cost and are depreciated principally on the straight-line method. Buildings are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, primarily 40 years. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, primarily ranging
from 16 to 20 years. For income tax purposes, accelerated methods of depreciation are used. Purchases of computer software are capitalized. External costs and certain internal costs (including payroll and payroll-related costs of employees) directly
associated with developing significant computer software applications for internal use are capitalized. Training and data conversion costs are expensed as incurred. Computer software costs are amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the software, which generally does not exceed five years.

Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when warranted, changes are made to them. Long-lived assets, including computer software, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their cost may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset group, which are identifiable and largely independent of other
assets groups, are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or
independent appraisals, as appropriate. When property is sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any gain or loss on the transaction is included in income.

The cost of major maintenance performed on manufacturing facilities,
composed of labor, materials and other incremental costs, is charged to operations as incurred. Start-up costs for new or expanded facilities are expensed as incurred.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

In accordance with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

(“FIN 47”), the Corporation recorded a pretax asset retirement liability of $23.6 million at December 31, 2005.
This liability represents the estimated costs to settle obligations in connection with the retirement of long-lived assets. FIN 47 requires the recording of an asset retirement obligation when the fair value of such a liability can be
reasonably estimated, even though uncertainty exists as to the timing and/or the method of settlement. The Corporation has no plans in the foreseeable future to retire any of the major facilities for which it estimated an asset retirement
obligation.

The cumulative effect on income, net of related
income tax effects, of recording the asset retirement obligation was $12.3 million, or $.03 per share. Had FIN 47 been adopted as of the beginning of the earliest year



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

presented in the consolidated financial statements, the estimated asset retirement obligation would have been approximately $22.4 million and
$21.3 million at the end of 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The tables below present the pro forma impact as if FIN 47 had been adopted prior to 2003.

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents costs in excess of
fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not subject to systematic amortization, but rather is tested for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have
occurred. Impairment testing compares the carrying amount of the goodwill with its fair value. Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows. When the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be
recorded. The Corporation has completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment and has determined that none of its goodwill is impaired.

The Corporation has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives
and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset
are less than its carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on discounted future cash flows compared to the carrying amount of the asset.

Investments in Equity Companies

Investments in companies over which the Corporation has the ability to exercise significant influence and that, in general,
are at least 20 percent owned are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income. These investments are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 18,

The
Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

. An impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

determined to be other than temporary. In judging “other than temporary,” the Corporation would consider the length of time and extent to which the
fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the equity company, the near-term and longer-term operating and financial prospects of the equity company, and its longer-term intent of retaining the investment in the equity
company.

Revenue Recognition

Sales revenue for the Corporation and its reportable business segments is
recognized at the time of product shipment or delivery, depending on when title passes, to unaffiliated customers, and when all of the following have occurred: a firm sales agreement is in place, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is
reasonably assured. Sales are reported net of estimated returns, consumer and trade promotions, rebates and freight allowed.

Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances

The cost of promotion activities provided to customers is classified as a reduction in sales revenue. In addition, the estimated redemption value of
consumer coupons is recorded at the time the coupons are issued and classified as a reduction in sales revenue.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed in the year the related advertisement is first presented by the media. For interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses
are charged to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related advertising expense for the full year.

Research Expense

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Environmental Expenditures

Environmental expenditures related to current operations that qualify as property, plant and equipment or which substantially increase the economic
value or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, and all other such expenditures are expensed as incurred. Environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed as incurred. Liabilities
are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or a commitment to a formal plan of
action. At environmental sites in which more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, a liability is recorded for the estimated allocable share of costs related to the Corporation’s involvement with the site as well as an
estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites in which the Corporation is the only responsible party, a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation is recorded.
Liabilities for future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated recoveries from insurers.

Foreign Currency Translation

The income statements of foreign operations, other than those in hyperinflationary economies, are translated into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange in
effect each month. The balance sheets of these operations are translated at period-end exchange rates, and the differences from historical exchange rates are reflected in Stockholders’ Equity as unrealized translation adjustments.



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The income statements and balance sheets of operations in hyperinflationary economies are translated
into U.S. dollars using both current and historical rates of exchange. The effect of exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities is reflected in income. Operations in Turkey (prior to 2005) are deemed to be hyperinflationary.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

All derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are either recorded in income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. The gain or loss on derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting loss or gain on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur. The gain or loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is included in other comprehensive income in the period that
changes in fair value occur and is reclassified to income in the same period that the hedged item affects income. The gain or loss on derivatives designated as hedges of investments in foreign subsidiaries is recognized in other comprehensive income
to offset the change in value of the net investments being hedged. The gain or loss on derivatives that have not been designated as hedging instruments is included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation

The Corporation’s stock-based employee compensation plans are described
in Note 13. The Corporation continues to account for stock options using the intrinsic-value method permitted by APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

. No employee compensation for stock options has been
charged to earnings because the exercise prices of all stock options granted under this plan have been equal to the market value of the Corporation’s common stock at the date of grant.

Restricted share awards, including restricted shares and restricted share
units, are measured at the fair value of the Corporation’s common stock on the date of the award, and are initially recorded in Stockholders’ Equity as unearned compensation. Unearned compensation is amortized to compensation expense over
the requisite service period on the straight-line method. Employer payroll taxes are recorded as expense when they become due at the time the awards vest. Unvested shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on sale or transfer generally for
three to five years from the grant date.

The following
presents information about net income and earnings per share (“EPS”) as if the Corporation had applied the fair value expense recognition requirements of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS
123”), to all employee stock options granted under the plan.



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Pursuant to the
requirements of SFAS 123, the weighted-average fair value of the individual employee stock options granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003 have been estimated as $11.94, $15.49 and $9.09, respectively, on the date of grant. The fair values were
determined using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model using the following assumptions:

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”), which revises SFAS 123. SFAS 123R also supersedes APB 25 and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

. SFAS 123R eliminates the
alternative to account for employee stock options under APB 25 and requires the fair value of all share-based payments to employees, including the fair value of grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement, generally
over the vesting period.

In March 2005, the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, which provides additional implementation guidance for SFAS 123R. Among other things, SAB 107 provides guidance on share-based payment valuations, income
statement classification and presentation, capitalization of costs and related income tax accounting.

SFAS 123R provides for adoption using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method. The Corporation will adopt SFAS 123R on
January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning January 1, 2006 for all share-based payments granted on or after that date and for all awards granted to employees prior to
January 1, 2006 that remain unvested on that date. The Corporation will continue to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards.

Adoption of SFAS 123R’s fair value method will have an effect on results
of operations, although it will not have a material impact on the Corporation’s overall financial position. The future impact of SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted.
However, had SFAS 123R been adopted in prior periods, the effect would have approximated the SFAS 123 pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures as shown above.

SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a
financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required, thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While those amounts



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

cannot be estimated for future periods (because they depend on, among other things, when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of
the Corporation’s common stock at the time of exercise), the amount of operating cash flows generated in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $15.1 million, $30.9 million and $7.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 2.     Discontinued Operations

In connection with the Spin-off discussed in Note 1, the Corporation
received a $213.4 million cash payment from Neenah Paper. The 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Income Statements, Cash Flow Statements and related disclosures present the results of Neenah Paper’s fine paper and technical paper businesses, which
were previously included in the Business-to-Business segment, as discontinued operations. Prior to the Spin-off, the Corporation internally consumed approximately 90 percent of the pulp produced by the Canadian pulp business. In connection with
the Spin-off, the Corporation entered into a long-term pulp supply agreement with Neenah Paper (as discussed in Note 10

)

, whereby the Corporation will continue to consume a substantial portion of the pulp produced by Neenah Paper.
Because the Corporation will continue to incur pulp costs in its continuing operations, the results of Neenah Paper’s Canadian pulp business were not included in discontinued operations.

Summarized financial information for discontinued operations is presented
below:

(a)

Includes operations through November 30, 2004; also included are transaction costs related to the Spin-off.

A summary of the assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive
income of Neenah Paper that were spun off is presented below:



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Note 3.     Competitive Improvement Initiatives

In July 2005, the Corporation authorized the initial phase of a multi-year
program to further improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and strategic cost reductions aimed at streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations, primarily in North America and
Europe.

The Competitive Improvement Initiatives commenced in
the third quarter of 2005 and are expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2008. Based on current estimates, the strategic cost reductions are expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately $900 million to $1.1
billion before tax ($625 - $775 million after tax) over that three and one-half year period.

By the end of 2008, it is anticipated there will be a net workforce reduction of about 10 percent, or approximately 6,000 employees. As of
December 31, 2005, a net workforce reduction of more than 400 had occurred. Approximately 20 manufacturing facilities, or 17 percent of the Corporation’s worldwide total, are expected to be sold or closed and an additional 4 facilities are
expected to be streamlined. As of December 31, 2005, charges have been recorded related to the initiatives for 14 facilities.

In connection with the Competitive Improvement Initiatives approved by the Corporation, charges totaling $228.6 million were incurred during 2005; $167.6
million after tax for the strategic cost reductions.

Of the
$228.6 million of charges, $179.7 million were noncash charges comprised of the following:

The following
summarizes the cash charges recorded and reconciles such charges to accrued expenses at December 31, 2005.

The Corporation also
recorded pension curtailments and special pension benefits aggregating $2.3 million.

Termination benefits related to workforce reductions were accrued in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

, SFAS No. 112,

Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,

and SFAS No. 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits,

as appropriate. Retention
bonuses related to workforce reductions were accrued in accordance with SFAS 146. The majority of the termination benefits and retention bonuses will be paid within 12 months of accrual. The termination benefits were provided under: a
special-benefit arrangement for affected employees in the U.S.; standard benefit practices in the U.K.; applicable union agreements; or local statutory requirements, as appropriate. Incremental depreciation and



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

amortization expenses were based on changes in useful lives and estimated residual values of assets that are continuing to be used, but will be removed from
service before the end of their originally assumed service period. Asset impairment charges have been recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

to reduce the carrying amount
of long-lived assets that will be sold or disposed of to their estimated fair values. The fair values of impaired assets were estimated by independent appraisers. Charges for asset write-offs reduce the carrying amount of long-lived assets to their
estimated salvage value in connection with the decision to dispose of such assets.

The strategic cost reductions included in the Competitive Improvement Initiatives are corporate decisions and are not included in the business segments’ operating profit performance. Certain actions yet to be
announced for the strategic cost reductions are still being evaluated. Accordingly, it is difficult at this time to estimate the total costs to be incurred by business segment over the life of the initiatives. The 2005 charges have been recorded in
Cost of Products Sold ($201.6 million) and Marketing, Research and General Expenses ($27.0 million). See Note 17 for additional information on the strategic cost reductions by business segment.

Note 4.    Acquisitions and Intangible Assets

Acquisitions

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Corporation acquired Microcuff GmbH,
a privately held medical device and technology company in Germany, for approximately $16 million. This acquisition will further enhance the Corporation’s Health Care business’ position as a leading global provider of innovative and
technologically advanced medical devices.

During the first
quarter of 2003, the Corporation purchased the Klucze tissue business in Poland. This acquisition was consistent with the Corporation’s strategy of growing its global consumer tissue business and provides it with a strong platform to expand its
business. The allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired was completed in 2003 and resulted in recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $20 million.

During the third quarter of 2003, the Corporation acquired an additional 49
percent interest in Kimberly-Clark Peru S.A. and the remaining 50 percent interest in its tissue joint venture in Brazil (Klabin Kimberly S.A.). The cost of these acquisitions totaled approximately $200 million. These acquisitions were a
result of the partners in each of the ventures exercising their options to sell their ownership interest to the Corporation. The allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired was completed in 2004 and resulted
in recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $140 million.

Goodwill

The changes
in the carrying amount of goodwill by business segment are as follows:



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets subject to amortization are included in Other Assets and consist of the following at December 31:

Amortization expense
for intangible assets was approximately $26 million in 2005, $14 million in 2004 and $13 million in 2003. Amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $39 million in 2006, $12 million in 2007, $9 million in 2008, $8 million in 2009 and $7
million in 2010.

Note 5.     Debt

Long-term debt is comprised of the following:

Fair value of total
long-term debt, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues, was approximately $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are
$67.2 million in 2006, $337.5 million in 2007, $49.1 million in 2008, $8.0 million in 2009 and $33.1 million in 2010.

During the third quarter of 2005, the Corporation issued $300 million of 4.875% Notes due August 15, 2015. Proceeds from the sale of the notes
were used for general corporate purposes and for the reduction of existing indebtedness, including portions of the Corporation’s outstanding commercial paper program.

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation had fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements related to a
$500 million 5.0% Note that matures on August 15, 2013.

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation had $1.5 billion of revolving credit facilities. These facilities, unused at December 31, 2005, permit borrowing at competitive interest rates and are available for general corporate
purposes, including backup for commercial paper borrowings. The Corporation pays commitment fees on the unused portion but may cancel the facilities without penalty at any time prior to their expiration. These facilities expire in June 2010.



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Debt payable within one year is as follows:

At December 31,
2005 and 2004, the weighted-average interest rate for commercial paper was 4.2 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, a three-year bank credit facility was established for the purpose of funding American Jobs Creation Act dividends. The
Corporation has the option to repay the facility in any month until the facility expires in October 2008. Currently, the Corporation plans to repay this obligation by the end of 2006; therefore, it has been classified as short-term debt. The
facility is denominated in Australian dollars and euros, and interest charges are based on the prevailing local short-term interest rates plus 12.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $308 million was outstanding. No
additional draws against the facility are permitted.

Note
6.    Preferred Securities of Subsidiary

In February 2001, the Corporation formed a Luxembourg-based financing subsidiary. The subsidiary issued 1 million shares of voting-preferred securities (the “Securities”) with an aggregate par value of $520 million to a
nonaffiliated beneficial interest holder for cash proceeds of $516.5 million. The Securities are entitled to a 98 percent vote and pay no dividend but accrue a fixed annual rate of return of 4.56 percent. Prior to September 2003, the Securities
accrued a variable rate of return. The Securities are in substance perpetual and are callable by the subsidiary at par value plus any accrued but unpaid return on the Securities in November 2008 and each 20-year anniversary thereafter. The
subsidiary also issued voting-preferred and common securities to the Corporation for total cash proceeds of $500 million. These securities are entitled to a combined two percent vote and the common securities are entitled to all of the residual
equity after satisfaction of the preferred interests. Approximately 97 percent of the above cash proceeds were loaned to the Corporation. These long-term loans bear fixed annual interest rates. The remaining funds are invested in other financial
assets. Prior to September 2003, the loans accrued interest at a variable rate. The Corporation is the primary beneficiary of the subsidiary and, accordingly, consolidates the subsidiary in the accompanying financial statements. The preferred and
common securities of the subsidiary held by the Corporation and the intercompany loans have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The return on the Securities is included in Minority Owners’ Share of Subsidiaries’ Net
Income in the Corporation’s consolidated income statement. The Securities are shown as Preferred Securities of Subsidiary on the consolidated balance sheet.

In June 2004, the nonaffiliated beneficial interest holder invested an additional $125 million, thereby increasing the
aggregate par value of the Securities that it held. In conjunction with this transaction, the fixed annual rate of return on the Securities was increased from 4.47 to 4.56 percent. The subsidiary loaned these funds to the Corporation, which used
them to reduce its outstanding commercial paper.

The
nonaffiliated beneficial interest holder does not have recourse to the general credit of the Corporation.

Note 7.     Stockholders’ Equity

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are as
follows:

Accumulated balances
of other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes are as follows:

Net unrealized
currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, except those in highly inflationary economies, are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders’ equity. For these operations,
changes in exchange rates generally do not affect cash flows; therefore, unrealized translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity rather than net income. Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of any of these
subsidiaries, the applicable unrealized translation adjustment would be removed from stockholders’ equity and reported as part of the gain or loss on the sale or liquidation. The increase in unrealized translation is primarily due to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Australian dollar.

Also included are the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature and transactions designated as
hedges of net foreign investments.

At December 31, 2005,
unremitted net income of equity companies included in consolidated retained earnings was about $834 million.

Note 8.     Risk Management

As a multinational enterprise, the Corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
prices. The Corporation employs a variety of practices to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

instruments. These derivative instruments, including some that are not designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges, are used only for risk management
purposes and not for speculation or trading. Foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions. The Corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to
those agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. Credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties.

One of the Corporation’s equity affiliates has entered into derivatives
with notional amounts that exceed the amount of the risk being hedged. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives that exceed the risk being hedged are recorded in that affiliate’s income.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Foreign currency exchange risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign
currency forward, option and swap contracts. The use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part,
losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Prior to 2004, foreign currency risk was managed by the selective, rather than the systematic, use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. Management does not foresee or
expect any significant change in such exposures in the near future or in the strategies it employs to manage them. In addition, many of the Corporation’s non-U.S. operations buy the majority of their inputs and sell the majority of their
outputs in their local currency, thereby minimizing the effect of currency rate changes on their local operating profit margins.

Foreign Currency Translation Risk

Translation adjustments result from translating foreign entities’ financial statements to U.S. dollars from their functional currencies. Translation
exposure, which results from possible changes in translation rates between functional currencies and the U.S. dollar, generally is not hedged. In 2005, in connection with its plan to repatriate unremitted foreign earnings under the American Jobs
Creation Act, the Corporation hedged a portion of its investments in certain subsidiaries. There are no hedges in place at December 31, 2005. The risk to any particular entity’s net assets is minimized to the extent that the entity is
financed with local currency borrowing.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is managed using a portfolio of
variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments and interest rate swaps. The objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. Management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in
its exposure to interest rate fluctuations in the near future or in the strategies it employs to manage them.

Commodity Price Risk

The Corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp, polypropylene and natural gas.

Selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market
price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. On a worldwide basis, the Corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. Increases in pulp prices could
adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. Derivative instruments have not been used to manage the pulp price risk.



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Polypropylene is subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and
other factors. A number of the Corporation’s products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, and incontinence care products contain certain polypropylene materials. The Corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers.
Significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the Corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these
materials. Derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks.

The Corporation uses derivative financial instruments to offset a substantial portion of its exposure to market risk arising from changes in the price of natural gas. Hedging of this risk is accomplished by entering
into forward swap contracts, which are designated as hedges of specific quantities of natural gas expected to be purchased in future months. These readily marketable swap contracts are recorded in the Corporation’s balance sheet at fair value.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Corporation formally documents and designates the swap contract as a cash-flow hedge, including how the effectiveness of the hedge will be measured. This process links the swap contract to
specific forecasted transactions. Since these swap contracts were highly effective, changes in their fair values were recorded in other comprehensive income, net of related income taxes, and recognized in income at the time the cost of the natural
gas was recognized in income.

Effect of Derivative
Instruments on Results of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income

Fair Value Hedges

The Corporation’s fair value hedges offset the effect of the hedged items in 2005, 2004 and 2003, resulting in no effect on income. In addition, during these years, all designated derivatives for firm commitments continued to qualify
for fair value hedge accounting.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognized in income when the hedged exposure affects income. The Corporation’s cash flow hedges resulted in no
significant ineffectiveness in 2005, 2004 and 2003 and consequently resulted in no significant effect on income. During the same period in which the hedged forecasted transactions affected earnings, the Corporation reclassified $11.2 million of
after-tax gains, and $9.0 million and $9.9 million of after-tax losses, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings. At December 31, 2005, the Corporation expects to reclassify $5.7 million of after-tax gains from
accumulated other comprehensive income primarily to cost of sales during the next twelve months, consistent with the timing of the underlying hedged transactions. The maximum maturity of cash flow derivatives in place at December 31, 2005 is
August 2017.

Net Investment Hedges

Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, the Corporation hedged a portion
of its investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as hedges of the related net investments. Under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,

changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income to offset the change in value of the net investment being hedged.

Note 9.     Variable Interest Entities

The Corporation has variable interests in the following financing and real
estate entities and synthetic fuel partnerships described in Note 14.

Financing Entities

The Corporation holds a
significant variable interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize long-term notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets, which were sold in 1999 and 1989 to nonaffiliated buyers. These
transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in SFAS No. 66,

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate

.
These sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of $617 million and a fair value of approximately $593 million at the date of sale. The notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money
center banks, which aggregated $617 million at December 31, 2005.

Because the Corporation desired to monetize the $617 million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains, in 1999 the Corporation transferred the notes received from the 1999 sale to a noncontrolled
financing entity, and in 2000 it transferred the notes received from the 1989 sale to another noncontrolled financing entity. The Corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities (collectively, the “Financing
Entities”). The transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the Financing Entities were made at fair value, were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss. In conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other
assets, the Financing Entities became obligated for $617 million in third-party debt financing. A nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the Financing Entities, has majority voting control over them
and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the Financing Entities. The Corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating $662 million and intercompany preferred stock of $50 million to the
Financing Entities, which serve as secondary collateral for the third-party lending arrangements. In the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit, the Corporation could
experience a maximum loss of $617 million under these arrangements.

The Corporation has not consolidated the Financing Entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity. Rather, it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting.
The Corporation retains equity interests in the Financing Entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes. As a result, the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the Corporation’s equity
interests in the Financing Entities for financial reporting purposes.

See Note 6 for a description of the Corporation’s Luxembourg-based financing subsidiary, which is consolidated because the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity.

Real Estate Entities

Effective March 31, 2004, the Corporation adopted FASB Interpretation
No. 46 (Revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities—an Interpretation of ARB 51

(“FIN 46R”), for its real estate entities described below. In 1994, the Corporation began participating in the
U.S. affordable and historic renovation real estate markets. Investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the United States Congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations. Accordingly, these investments generate
income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the Corporation’s income tax liabilities. The Corporation had invested in these



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

markets through (i) partnership arrangements in which it is a limited partner, (ii) limited liability companies (“LLCs”) in which it is a
nonmanaging member and (iii) investments in various funds in which the Corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors. These entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real
estate projects.

Adoption of FIN 46R required the Corporation
to consolidate ten apartment projects and two hotels because it was the primary beneficiary of each of these real estate ventures. Subsequently, three of the apartments and the two hotels became wholly-owned by the Corporation. For the entities that
remain consolidated under FIN 46R, the carrying amount of the assets that serve as collateral is $47.0 million for obligations of these ventures of $42.7 million at December 31, 2005. The assets are classified as property, plant and
equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Except for the Corporation’s guarantee of $14.6 million of the obligations of these ventures, neither the creditors nor the other beneficial interest holders of these consolidated ventures have
recourse to the general credit of the Corporation.

The
Corporation accounts for its interests in real estate entities that are not consolidated by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method, as appropriate, and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits
as a reduction in its income tax provision. As of December 31, 2005, the Corporation had a net equity of $20.9 million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities. The Corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately $84.1
million, $71.8 million and $59.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was $255.8 million. A total of $19.7 million of the permanent financing
debt is guaranteed by the Corporation and the remainder of this debt is not supported or guaranteed by the Corporation. Except for the guaranteed portion, permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the
Corporation. From time to time, temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the Corporation. In general, the Corporation’s interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained. At December 31, 2005,
$34.3 million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the Corporation.

If the Corporation’s investments in its nonconsolidated real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts, a portion of the tax
credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2005, this recapture risk is estimated to be $34.5 million. The Corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the
recapture period, nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need. Accordingly, the recapture risk is considered to be remote.

At December 31, 2005, the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure for
its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be $109.4 million and was comprised of its net equity in these entities of $20.9 million, its permanent financing guarantees of $19.7 million, its interim financing guarantees of $34.3
million and the income tax credit recapture risk of $34.5 million.

Note 10.    Leases and Commitments

Leases

The Corporation has entered into operating leases for certain warehouse facilities, automobiles and equipment. The future
minimum obligations under operating leases having a noncancelable term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2005, are as follows:

Certain operating
leases contain residual value guarantees, which provide that if the Corporation does not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, the Corporation is liable to the lessor for the shortfall, if any, between the
proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. At December 31, 2005, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantee was approximately $20 million. Management expects the proceeds from the sale of the properties under
the operating leases will exceed the agreed values.

Operating
lease obligations have been reduced by approximately $2 million for rental income from noncancelable sublease agreements.

Consolidated rental expense under operating leases was $199.0 million, $195.9 million and $186.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Purchase Commitments

In conjunction with the Spin-off, the Corporation entered into a long-term
pulp supply agreement with Neenah Paper. Under the agreement, the Corporation has agreed to purchase annually declining specified minimum tonnages of pulp. In January 2006, the pulp supply agreement was modified to reduce the Corporation’s 2006
purchase obligation by approximately 11 percent. Minimum commitments under the agreement are estimated to be approximately $235 million in 2006, $233 million in 2007, $200 million in 2008, $157 million in 2009 and $105 million in 2010. The
latter two years reflect the phase-down period described in the following paragraph. These commitments represented 16 percent, 16 percent, 13 percent, 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of the Corporation’s total estimated
requirements for virgin pulp. The Corporation purchased approximately $272 million under that agreement in 2005.

Under the agreement, the prices for pulp will be based on published industry index prices, subject to certain minimum and maximum prices, less agreed-upon
discounts. The commitments are structured as supply-or-pay and take-or-pay arrangements. Accordingly, if the Corporation does not purchase the specified minimums, it must pay for the shortfall based on the difference between the contract price and
any lower price Neenah Paper obtains for the pulp, plus ten percent of the difference. If Neenah Paper does not supply the specified minimums, it must pay for the shortfall based on the difference between the contract price and any higher price that
the Corporation pays to purchase the pulp, plus ten percent of that difference. Either party can elect a two-year



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

phase-down period for the agreement, to begin no earlier than January 1, 2009 under which the minimum commitments would be approximately
$157 million in the first year and $105 million in the second year. Either party may terminate the pulp supply agreement for certain events specified in the agreement.

The Corporation has entered into other long-term contracts for the purchase of raw materials, principally pulp, and
utilities, principally electricity. The minimum purchase commitments extend beyond 2009. Commitments under these contracts are approximately $181 million in 2006, $118 million in 2007, $73 million in 2008, $69 million in 2009 and $53
million in 2010. Total commitments beyond the year 2010 are $332 million.

Although the Corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above-mentioned leases and purchase commitments, management believes the Corporation’s exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not
material.

Note 11.    Contingencies and Legal Matters

Litigation

The following is a brief description of certain legal and administrative
proceedings to which the Corporation or its subsidiaries is a party or to which the Corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ properties are subject. In management’s opinion, none of the legal and administrative proceedings described below,
individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

As of December 31, 2005, the Corporation, along with many other nonaffiliated companies, was a party to lawsuits with
allegations of personal injury resulting from asbestos exposure on the defendants’ premises and allegations that the defendants manufactured, sold, distributed or installed products which cause asbestos-related lung disease. These general
allegations are often made against the Corporation without any apparent evidence or identification of a specific product or premises of the Corporation. The Corporation has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of these asbestos
cases. All asbestos claims have been tendered to the Corporation’s insurance carriers for defense and indemnity. The financial statements reflect appropriate accruals for the Corporation’s portion of the costs estimated to be incurred in
connection with resolving these claims.

The Corporation,
through a wholly-owned subsidiary, KCC Comercial Ltda. (“KCC Comercial”), owns a 70 percent interest in a Brazil corporation, Kimberly-Clark Kenko Industria e Comercio Ltda. (“K-C Kenko”). The owner of the remaining
30 percent of K-C Kenko filed an action, for the benefit of K-C Kenko, in the Arbitration Center of the Brazil-Canada Chamber of Commerce in Brazil alleging, among other things, that KCC Comercial negligently managed K-C Kenko. KCC
Comercial has denied the claims, raised numerous defenses and has asserted counterclaims. In management’s opinion, this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Contingency

One of the Corporation’s North American tissue mills has an agreement
to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next 12 years. In the event that the mill was shut down, the Corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of
its owner, the local utility company. The net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of December 31, 2005 is estimated to be approximately $150 million. Management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote.

Environmental Matters

The Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, in management’s opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on
the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Note 12.    Postretirement and Other Benefits

Pension Plans

Substantially all regular employees in North America and the United Kingdom are covered by defined benefit pension plans (the “Principal Plans”)
and/or defined contribution retirement plans. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined
benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”). Subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits, any funding
shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years. Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside
the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in such countries.

In accordance with SFAS No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,

the Corporation recorded a minimum pension liability for underfunded
plans representing the excess of the unfunded ABO over previously recorded net pension liabilities. The minimum pension liability is included in Noncurrent Employee Benefit and Other Obligations on the balance sheet. An offsetting charge is included
as an intangible asset to the extent of unrecognized prior service cost, and the balance is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). The principal cause of the increase in additional minimum pension liability in 2005 was a decrease
in the discount rates used to estimate the ABO.

Information
about the minimum pension liability follows:

Other
Postretirement Benefit Plans

Substantially all North
American retirees and employees are covered by health care and life insurance benefit plans. Certain benefits are based on years of service and/or age at retirement. The plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire
before 1993 and contributory for most employees who retire after 1992, except that the Corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003.

Prior to 2004, certain U.S. plans limited the Corporation’s cost of future annual per capita retiree medical benefits
to no more than 200 percent of the 1992 annual per capita cost. These plans reached this limitation



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(the “Cap”) and were amended during 2003. Among other things, the amendments index the Cap by 3 percent annually beginning in 2005 for certain
employees retiring on or before April 1, 2004 and limit the Corporation’s future cost for retiree health care benefits to a defined fixed per capita cost for certain employees retiring after April 1, 2004. The annual increase in the
consolidated weighted-average health care cost trend rate is expected to be 9.91 percent in 2006, 8.86 percent in 2007 and to gradually decline to 5.19 percent in 2011 and thereafter.

Summarized financial information about postretirement plans, excluding
defined contribution retirement plans, is presented below.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return and Investment Strategies for the Principal Plans

The expected long-term rate of return on pension fund
assets was determined based on several factors, including input from pension investment consultants and projected long-term returns of broad equity and bond indices. The Corporation also considered the U.S. plan’s historical 10-year and 15-year
compounded annual returns of 9.36 percent and 10.28 percent, respectively, which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The Corporation anticipates that on average the investment managers for each of the plans
comprising the Principal Plans will generate annual long-term rates of return of at least 8.5 percent. The Corporation’s expected long-term rate of return on the assets in the Principal Plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about
70 percent with equity managers, with expected long-term rates of return of approximately 10 percent, and 30 percent with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of about 6 percent. The Corporation regularly
reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Also, when deemed appropriate, the Corporation executes hedging strategies using index options and futures to
limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level. The Corporation last executed this hedging strategy for 2003. No hedging instruments are currently in place. The Corporation will continue
to evaluate its long-term rate of return assumptions at least annually and will adjust them as necessary.

Plan Assets

The Corporation’s pension plan asset allocations for its Principal Plans are as follows:

The plan assets did
not include a significant amount of the Corporation’s common stock.

Cash Flows

While the
Corporation is not required to make a contribution in 2006 to the U.S. plan, the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated. The Corporation currently anticipates contributing about $80 million to its pension plans outside the U.S. in 2006.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are anticipated to be paid:

Health Care Cost Trends

Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the amounts reported for postretirement health care benefit plans. A
one-percentage-point change in assumed health care trend rates would have the following effects on 2005 data:

Defined
Contribution Retirement Plans

Contributions to defined
contribution retirement plans are primarily based on the age and compensation of covered employees. The Corporation’s contributions, all of which were charged to expense, were $52.7 million, $47.6 million and $44.9 million in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Investment Plans

Voluntary contribution investment plans are provided to substantially all
North American and most European employees. Under the plans, the Corporation matches a portion of employee contributions. Costs charged to expense under the plans were $31.0 million, $30.8 million and $32.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Note 13.     Stock Compensation Plans

The Corporation’s Equity Participation Plans and its
Outside Directors’ Compensation Plan (the “Plans”) provide for awards of stock options, restricted shares and restricted share units to employees and outside directors, and (prior to 1999) participation shares to employees of the
Corporation. As of December 31, 2005, the number of shares of common stock available for stock option and restricted share awards under the Plans aggregated 29.7 million shares.

Stock Options

Stock options granted to executives and other key employees are granted at not less than the market value at the date of grant, expire 10 years after
the date of grant and generally become exercisable over three years. Stock options granted to outside directors are granted at not less than the market value at the date of grant and vest at time of grant.

In connection with the Spin-off, the number and exercise prices of
outstanding options were proportionately adjusted to maintain the aggregate intrinsic value of the options before and after the Spin-off. As a result of the adjustment, the number of outstanding options increased by .5 million shares and the
average exercise price decreased by approximately $.83. In addition, certain stock options previously granted to Neenah Paper employees were converted to Neenah Paper options with terms and amounts that maintained the aggregate intrinsic value of
the options. None of the information for 2003, the options outstanding at the beginning of 2004 or grants for 2004 reflect adjustments made in connection with the Spin-off.

Restricted Share
Awards

The Plans provide for restricted shares or
restricted share units not to exceed 18.0 million shares of the Corporation’s common stock. Prior to 2004, and except for certain foreign locations, awards were in the form of restricted shares, which vest and become unrestricted shares in
three to 10 years from the date of grant. Although participants are entitled to cash dividends and may vote such awarded shares, the sale or transfer of such shares is limited during the restricted period. Awards granted to employees in certain
foreign locations were in the form of restricted share units, which vest and become unrestricted shares in three to 10 years from the date of grant.

Effective in 2004, nearly all awards were in the form of restricted share units, some of which vest on a time basis and others vest on achievement of
performance-based standards. The time-based restricted shares and share units vest over three to five years. The performance-based restricted share units vest three years after grant in a range of zero to 150 percent of target levels of return
on invested capital (“ROIC”) during the three years. Dividends are paid on restricted share units at the same rate as on the Corporation’s common stock. At maturity, restricted share units are paid in equivalent shares of the
Corporation’s common stock.



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Data concerning restricted share awards follows:

The number of
performance-based restricted share units included in the table above is based on achievement of targeted levels of ROIC. Compensation expense is adjusted based on actual ROIC achieved during the three-year period following grant. During 2005, 2004
and 2003, $32.4 million, $19.4 million and $18.2 million, respectively, was charged to compensation expense under the Plans. The tax effect of differences between compensation expense for financial statement and income tax purposes is
recorded as additional paid-in capital.

Participation
Shares

Prior to 1999, key employees were awarded
participation shares that were payable in cash at the end of the vesting period. The amount of cash paid to participants was based on the increase in the book value of the Corporation’s common stock during the award period. Participants did not
receive dividends on the participation shares, but their accounts were credited with dividend shares payable in cash at the maturity of the award. Neither participation nor dividend shares were shares of common stock. Amounts expensed related to
participation shares were $11.1 million in 2003. Final payments for matured shares were made in February 2004.

Note 14.     Synthetic Fuel Partnerships

In April 2003, the Corporation acquired a 49.5 percent minority interest in a synthetic fuel partnership. In October 2004, the Corporation acquired a
49 percent minority interest in an additional synthetic fuel partnership. Although these partnerships are variable interest entities that are subject to the requirements of FIN 46R, the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary, and the
entities have not been consolidated. Synthetic fuel produced by the partnerships is eligible for synthetic fuel tax credits through 2007, although the credits begin to be phased out as the price of domestic crude oil increases above certain
statutory amounts.

The production of synthetic fuel results in
pretax losses that are reported as Nonoperating Expense on the Corporation’s income statement. The synthetic fuel tax credits, as well as tax deductions for the nonoperating losses, reduce the Corporation’s income tax expense. The effects
of those losses and benefits for 2005 and 2004 are shown in the following table:

The effects of these
tax credits are shown separately in the Corporation’s reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate to its effective income tax rate in Note 15.



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Because the partnerships have received favorable private letter rulings from the IRS and because the
partnerships’ test procedures conform to IRS guidance, the Corporation’s loss exposure under the synthetic fuel partnerships is minimal.

Note 15.     Income Taxes

An analysis of the provision for income taxes for income from continuing operations follows:

Income from continuing
operations before income taxes is earned in the following tax jurisdictions:



KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are composed of the following:

Valuation allowances
increased $221.6 million and $4.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 was related to an increase in excess foreign tax credits that are potentially not usable in the U.S. during the 2006 through 2015 carryover period.
Valuation allowances at the end of 2005 primarily relate to excess foreign tax credits in the U.S. and income tax loss carryforwards of $916.7 million, that potentially are not usable primarily in jurisdictions outside the U.S. If not utilized
against taxable income, $425.7 million of the loss carryforwards will expire from 2006 through 2025. The remaining $491.0 million has no expiration date.

Realization of income tax loss carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of these carryforwards. Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets, net of applicable valuation allowances, will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced or
increased if estimates of future taxable income change during the carryforward period.

Presented below is a reconciliation of the income tax provision computed at the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate to the provision for income taxes.

(a)

Other—net is comprised of numerous items, none of which is greater than 1.7 percent of income from continuing operations.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the
“Act”) was signed into law. The Act provides, among other things, a one-time deduction for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to and reinvested in the United States. During 2005, the Corporation repatriated approximately $985
million of previously unremitted earnings of certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries under the provisions of the Act. As a result, the Corporation recorded income tax expense and a related income tax liability of approximately $55.5 million
in 2005.

At December 31, 2005, U.S. income taxes have not
been provided on approximately $3.7 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. These earnings, which are considered to be invested indefinitely, would become subject to income tax if they were remitted as
dividends, were lent to the Corporation or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not
practicable because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation.

The Corporation accrues liabilities in current income taxes for potential assessments, which at December 31, 2005 and 2004 aggregated $268.8 million and $356.4 million, respectively. Of the decrease,
$53.1 million was due to the settlement of audit issues related to U.S. foreign tax credits which resulted in an increase in deferred tax assets for unused credits. This increase was offset by higher valuation allowances since the credits
potentially may not be used before they expire. The accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may
be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Corporation’s U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2003. IRS assessments of additional taxes
have been paid through 1998. Refund actions are pending with the IRS Examination Division or Appeals Office for the years 1993 through 1998. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Note 17.     Business Segment and Geographic Data Information

The Corporation is organized into operating segments based on product groupings. These operating segments have been
aggregated into three reportable global business segments: Personal Care; Consumer Tissue; and Business-to-Business. The reportable segments were determined in accordance with how the Corporation’s executive managers develop and execute the
Corporation’s global strategies to drive growth and profitability of the Corporation’s worldwide Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and Business-to-Business operations. These strategies include global plans for branding and product
positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management, and capacity and capital investments for each of these businesses. Segment management is evaluated on several factors, including operating
profit. Segment operating profit excludes other income and (expense), net; income and expense not associated with the business segments; and the costs of corporate decisions related to the strategic cost reductions included in the Competitive
Improvement Initiatives. Corporate & Other includes the costs of the strategic cost reductions described in Note 3. Corporate & Other assets include the Corporation’s investments in equity affiliates, finance
operations and real estate entities, and deferred tax assets. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1.

The principal sources of revenue in each global business segment are described below.

•

The Personal Care segment manufactures and markets disposable diapers, training and youth pants, and swimpants; baby wipes; feminine and incontinence care products; and related
products. Products in this segment are primarily for household use and are sold under a variety of brand names, including Huggies, Pull-Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites, Kotex, Lightdays, Depend, Poise and other brand names.

The Consumer Tissue segment manufactures and markets facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use. Products in this segment are sold
under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, Viva, Andrex, Scottex, Hakle, Page and other brand names.

The Business-to-Business segment manufactures and markets disposable, single-use, health and hygiene products to the away-from-home marketplace. These products include facial and
bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers, surgical gowns, drapes, infection control products, sterilization wrap, disposable face masks and exam gloves, respiratory products, other disposable medical products and other products. Products in
this segment are sold under the Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex, Scott, Kimwipes, WypAll, Surpass, Safeskin, Tecnol, Ballard and other brand names.

Approximately 13 percent of net sales were to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in 2005, 2004 and 2003, primarily in the Personal Care and Consumer Tissue businesses.

Information concerning consolidated operations by business
segment and geographic area, as well as data for equity companies, is presented in the following tables:

Consolidated Operations by Business Segment

(a)

Corporate & Other includes costs aggregating $228.6 million in 2005 for the Competitive Improvement Initiatives. On a business segment basis, actual costs recorded in 2005

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Kimberly-Clark Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kimberly-Clark Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kimberly-Clark Corporation and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, on December 31, 2005, the Corporation changed its method of determining conditional asset retirement obligations.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 21, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2005, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Corporation’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded
that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s Report on the Financial Statements

Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s management is responsible for all aspects of the business, including the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report. The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles considered appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly the Corporation’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent
basis. Management also has prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some financial statement amounts are based on estimates
and judgments. Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report. These measures include an effective
control-oriented environment in which the internal audit function plays an important role and an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors that oversees the financial reporting process.

The consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm,
Deloitte & Touche LLP. During its audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP was given unrestricted access to all financial records, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and the Board of Directors and all committees of the board.
Management believes that all representations made to the independent registered public accountants during their audits were valid and appropriate.

Audit Committee Oversight and the Corporation’s Code of Conduct

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, assists the board in
fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Corporation; the audits of its consolidated financial statements; and internal control over financial
reporting. The Audit Committee reviews with the auditors any relationships that may affect their objectivity and independence. The Audit Committee also reviews with management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting
firm the quality and adequacy of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting, including compliance matters related to the Corporation’s code of conduct, and the results of the internal and external audits. The Audit
Committee has reviewed and recommended that the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report be included in the Form 10-K for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.



PART II

(Continued)

The Corporation’s code of conduct, among other things, contains policies for conducting business
affairs in a lawful and ethical manner everywhere it does business, for avoiding potential conflicts of interest and for preserving confidentiality of information and business ideas. Internal controls have been implemented to provide reasonable
assurance that the code of conduct is followed.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. This
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and safeguarding of the Corporation’s assets. This system is supported with written
policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function. Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified. All internal control systems have inherent
limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and, therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial statement preparation and such asset safeguarding.

The Corporation has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria described in

“Internal Control—Integrated Framework”

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2005, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Deloitte & Touche LLP has issued its report on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears below.



PART II

(Continued)

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Kimberly-Clark Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that
the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.



PART II

(Continued)

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the Corporation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 and our report dated February 21, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding a change in the Corporation’s method of determining conditional asset retirement obligations.

Changes in
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been
no changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above in “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” that occurred during the
Corporation’s fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

acquisitions to honor existing obligations of acquired entities. The Corporation will not make any additional grants or awards under such plans, although the terms of one acquired deferred compensation plan provide for issuance of a de minimus
number of shares of the Corporation’s common stock for reinvested dividends on deferred amounts.

1999 Restricted Stock Plan.

In 1999, the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved the 1999 Restricted Stock Plan under which certain key
employees could be granted, in the aggregate, up to 2,500,000 shares of the Corporation’s common stock or awards of restricted stock units. These restricted stock awards vest and become unrestricted shares in three to ten years from the date of
grant. Although plan participants are entitled to cash dividends and may vote such awarded shares, the sale or transfer of such shares is limited during the restricted period. The market value of the Corporation’s stock at the date of grant
determines the value of the restricted stock award. Although no additional awards can be granted under this plan, unvested restricted share units are credited with dividends that are converted to additional restricted share units.

Outside Directors’ Compensation Plan.

In 2001, the
Corporation’s Board of Directors approved the Outside Directors’ Compensation Plan. A maximum of 1,000,000 shares of the Corporation’s common stock is available for grant under this plan. The Corporation’s Board of Directors may
