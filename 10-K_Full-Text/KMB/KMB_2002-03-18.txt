PART  I

ITEM  1. BUSINESS

Kimberly-Clark  Corporation  was incorporated in Delaware in 1928.  As used in
Items  1,  2  and  7  of  this  Form  10-K,  the  term "Corporation" refers to
Kimberly-Clark  Corporation  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries.    In  the
remainder of this Form 10-K, the terms "Kimberly-Clark" or "Corporation" refer
only to Kimberly-Clark Corporation.  Financial information by business segment
and  geographic  area, and information about principal products and markets of
the  Corporation,  contained  under  the  caption "Management's Discussion and
Analysis" and in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
the  2001  Annual  Report  to Stockholders, are incorporated in this Item 1 by
reference.

RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS.    The Corporation is a global consumer products company
based  on  the  strategy  of  building  its personal care, consumer tissue and
business-to-business  businesses.    Since 1997, the Corporation has completed
about  30  acquisitions  in its core businesses and approximately 10 strategic
divestitures,  including  the  following  transactions:

- -    On March 27, 1997, the Corporation sold its Coosa Pines, Alabama pulp
     and  newsprint operations, and related woodlands, to Alliance
     Forest Products  Inc.,  a  publicly-held Canadian corporation, for
     approximately $600 million  in  cash.

- -    On June 6, 1997, the Corporation sold its 50.1 percent interest in Scott
     Paper  Limited, a publicly-traded Canadian company to Kruger, Inc., a
     Canadian paper  and  forest  products  company,  for  approximately  $127
     million.

- -    On December 18, 1997, the Corporation acquired Tecnol Medical Products,
     Inc.  ("Tecnol"),  a  leading  maker of disposable face masks and patient
     care products,  in a merger transaction in which the outstanding Tecnol
     shares were converted  into  shares  of  Kimberly-Clark common stock.  The
     transaction was valued  at  approximately  $428  million and was accounted
     for as a purchase.

- -    On May 28, 1998, the Corporation purchased a 50 percent equity interest
     in  Klabin Tissue S.A. (now known as Klabin Kimberly S.A.), the leading
     tissue manufacturer  in  Brazil.

- -    On July 21, 1998, the Corporation purchased an additional 10 percent
     ownership  interest  in  its  Korean  affiliate,  YuHan-Kimberly,  Limited,
     increasing  its  ownership  interest  to  70  percent.

- -    On August 19, 1998, the Corporation sold the outstanding shares of K-C
     Aviation Inc., a leading provider of business aviation services, to
     Gulfstream Aerospace  Corporation  for  $250  million  in  cash.

- -    On June 10, 1999, the Corporation purchased the European consumer and
     away-from-home  tissue  businesses  of  Attisholz Holding AG for
     approximately $365 million. The acquired businesses are located in Germany,
     Switzerland and Austria.

- -    On  September  23,  1999,  the Corporation acquired Ballard Medical
     Products,  a leading maker of disposable medical devices for respiratory
     care, gastroenterology  and  cardiology,  at  a  cost of approximately
     $788 million, including  the  value  of  common  stock  exchanged  and
     other  costs  of the transaction.    This  acquisition  was  accounted
     for  as  a  purchase.

- -    On  September  30,  1999,  the  Corporation  completed  the sale of
     approximately  460,000  acres  of  timberland  in  Alabama,  Mississippi
     and Tennessee for notes receivable having a face value of $397 million
     (and a fair value  of  $383  million).

ITEM  1. BUSINESS  (Continued)

- -    On  February 8, 2000, the Corporation acquired Safeskin Corporation
     ("Safeskin"),  a  leading  maker  of  disposable  gloves  for  health
     care, high-technology  and  scientific  industries, in a merger transaction
     in which the  outstanding  Safeskin shares were converted into shares of
     Kimberly-Clark common  stock.  The transaction was valued at approximately
     $750 million and was  accounted  for  as  a  purchase.

- -    On July 5, 2000, the Corporation acquired a majority of the shares of
     privately  held  S-K  Corporation  of  Taiwan,  which  held  trademark  and
     distribution  rights  in  Taiwan for the Corporation's global brands
     including Kleenex,  Huggies  and Kotex.  Prior to the acquisition, the
     Corporation owned approximately  3  percent  of  S-K  Corporation.

- -    On  December 20, 2000, the Corporation purchased an additional 33.3
     percent  ownership  interest  in  its  Taiwanese affiliate, Taiwan Scott
     Paper Corporation,  increasing  its  ownership  interest  to  100  percent.

- -    On January 31, 2001, the Corporation acquired Linostar S.p.A., a leading
     Italian-based  diaper  manufacturer  that produced and marketed Lines,
     Italy's second  largest  diaper  brand.

- -    On July 1, 2001, the Corporation acquired an additional 5 percent equity
     interest  in  its  Australian  affiliate,  Kimberly-Clark  Australia Pty
     Ltd., increasing its ownership interest to 55 percent. The Corporation and
     the owner of  the  remaining  45  percent also exchanged options for the
     purchase by the Corporation  of  the  remaining  45  percent  prior  to
     June  30,  2005.

 On  November  21,  1997,  the Corporation announced a restructuring plan (the
"1997  Plan"). The 1997 Plan, among other things, resulted in the sale, closure
or downsizing of 16 manufacturing facilities worldwide  and a workforce
reduction of  approximately  3,740 employees.  Costs for the 1997 Plan of $250.8
million and $414.2 million were recorded in 1998 and 1997, respectively, at the
time costs became accruable under appropriate accounting principles.  Included
in  such  costs  was accelerated  depreciation  charged  to cost of products
sold related to assets that  were  to  be  disposed  of  but  which  continued
to  be  operated during 1997 and 1998.  In 1999, the Corporation recorded a net
credit of $16.7  million,  which  was  composed  of  accelerated  depreciation
expense of $23.7  million,  reductions  in  accrued  costs  of  $31.9  million
and  lower asset write-offs  and higher sales proceeds totaling $8.5 million,
due to changes in estimates.

In  the  fourth  quarter  of  1998,  the  Corporation  announced  a facilities
consolidation plan (the "1998 Plan"). The 1998 Plan, among other things,
resulted in  further  alignment of tissue manufacturing capacity with demand in
Europe, closure  of  a diaper manufacturing facility in Canada, shut down and
disposal of  a  tissue  machine in Thailand, write down of certain excess
feminine care production  equipment  in  North  America and a reduction in the
Corporation's workforce  of  814 employees.  Costs for the 1998 Plan of $18.2
million, $42.6 million  and $49.1 million were recorded in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, and  charged  to  cost  of  products  sold.  The  year 2000 costs
are composed primarily  of certain severance costs and charges for accelerated
depreciation for  the  Corporation's  Larkfield,  U.K.  tissue  manufacturing
facility that remained  in  use  until  it  was  shutdown  in  October  2000.



PART  I
(Continued)

ITEM  1. BUSINESS  (Continued)

The  1997  Plan  and  the  1998  Plan  were completed as of December 31, 2000.

DESCRIPTION OF THE CORPORATION.  The Corporation is principally engaged in the
manufacturing  and  marketing throughout the world of a wide range of consumer
and  business-to-business  products.    The  Corporation also produces premium
business correspondence and technical papers.  Most of these products are made
from  natural  and  synthetic  fibers  using  advanced technologies in fibers,
nonwovens  and  absorbency.

Following  an  internal  organization  change in late 2001, the Corporation is
organized  into  three business segments:  Personal Care; Consumer Tissue; and
Business-to-Business.  The  financial  information  by  business  segment  for
earlier  periods  which  is  incorporated in this Item 1 by reference has been
reclassified  to  conform  to  the  new  business  segments.

The  Personal  Care  segment  manufactures  and  markets  disposable  diapers,
training  and  youth  pants  and  swimpants;  feminine  and  incontinence care
products;  and  related  products.    Products  in  this  business segment are
primarily  for  household use and are sold under a variety of well-known brand
names,  including  Huggies,  Pull-Ups,  Little  Swimmers,  GoodNites,  Kotex,
Lightdays,  Depend,  Poise  and  other  brand  names.

The  Consumer  Tissue  segment  manufactures  and  markets facial and bathroom
tissue,  paper  towels  and  napkins for household use; wet wipes; and related
products.    Products  in  this  business  segment are sold under the Kleenex,
Scott, Cottonelle, Viva, Andrex, Scottex, Page, Huggies and other brand names.

The  Business-to-Business segment manufactures and markets facial and bathroom
tissue,  paper  towels, wipers and napkins for away-from-home use; health care
products  such  as  surgical  gowns,  drapes,  infection  control  products,
sterilization  wraps,  disposable  face  masks  and  exam  gloves, respiratory
products and other disposable medical products; printing, premium business and
correspondence  papers;  specialty  and  technical papers; and other products.
Products  in this business segment are sold under the Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex,
Scott,  Kimwipes,  WypAll, Surpass, Safeskin, Tecnol, Ballard, and other brand
names.

Products  for  household  use  are  sold directly, and through wholesalers, to
supermarkets,  mass  merchandisers,  drugstores,  warehouse clubs, variety and
department  stores  and other retail outlets.  Products for away-from-home use
are  sold  through distributors and directly to manufacturing, lodging, office
building,  food  service  and health care establishments and other high volume
public  facilities.   Health care products are primarily sold to distributors,
converters  and  end-users.    Paper  products  are  sold  directly  to users,
converters,  manufacturers,  publishers  and  printers,  and  through  paper
merchants,  brokers,  sales  agents  and  other  resale  agencies.

In  2001,  approximately  10.4%  of  net  sales were to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
primarily  in  the  Personal  Care  and Consumer Tissue businesses.  No single
customer  accounted  for  10%  or  more  of  net  sales  in  2000  and  1999.

PATENTS  AND  TRADEMARKS.  The Corporation owns various patents and trademarks
registered  domestically  and  in  many  foreign  countries.   The Corporation
considers  the  patents  and trademarks which it owns and the trademarks under
which  it  sells  certain  of  its  products  to  be material to its business.
Consequently,  the  Corporation  seeks  patent and trademark protection by all
available  means, including registration.  A partial list of the Corporation's
trademarks is included under the caption "Additional Information - Trademarks"
contained in the 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein
by  reference.

ITEM  1. BUSINESS  (Continued)

RAW  MATERIALS.    Superabsorbent  materials  are  important  components  in
disposable  diapers,  training and youth pants and incontinence care products.
Polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials
for  manufacturing  nonwoven  fabrics,  which  are used in disposable diapers,
training  and  youth  pants, wet wipes, feminine pads, incontinence and health
care  products,  and  away-from-home  wipers.

Cellulose  fiber,  in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber, is the primary
raw  material  for  the  Corporation's  tissue  and  paper  products and is an
important  component  in disposable diapers, training pants, feminine pads and
incontinence  care  products.

Most  recovered  paper  and synthetics are purchased from third parties.  Pulp
and  recycled fiber are produced by the Corporation and purchased from others.
The  Corporation  considers the supply of such raw materials to be adequate to
meet the needs of its businesses.  See "Factors That May Affect Future Results
- -  Raw  Materials."

The Corporation owns or controls approximately 5.9 million acres of forestland
in  Canada,  principally  as  a  fiber  source  for  pulp production, which is
consumed  internally  for tissue products.  Approximately 1.0 million acres in
the  province  of  Nova Scotia are owned by the Corporation, and approximately
4.9 million  acres,  principally  in  the province of Ontario, are held under
long-term  Crown  rights  or  leases.

COMPETITION.    For  a  discussion of the competitive environment in which the
Corporation conducts its business, see "Factors That May Affect Future Results
- -  Competitive  Environment."

RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT.  A major portion of total research and development
expenditures  is  directed  toward  new  or improved personal care, tissue and
health  care  products  and  nonwoven  materials.    Consolidated research and
development  expense  was  $295.3 million in 2001, $277.4 million in 2000, and
$249.8  million  in  1999.

ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS.    Total  worldwide capital expenditures for voluntary
environmental controls or controls necessary to comply with legal requirements
relating  to the protection of the environment at the Corporation's facilities
are  expected to be approximately $57 million in 2002 and $53 million in 2003.
Of  these  amounts, approximately $15 million in 2002, and $28 million in 2003
are  expected to be spent at facilities in the U.S.  For facilities outside of
the  U.S.,  capital expenditures for environmental controls are expected to be
approximately  $42  million  in  2002  and  $25  million  in  2003.

Total  worldwide  operating expenses for environmental compliance are expected
to  be approximately $180 million in 2002 and $182 million in 2003.  Operating
expenses  for  environmental  compliance  with  respect to U.S. facilities are
expected  to  be  approximately  $98  million in 2002 and $99 million in 2003.
Operating  expenses  for  environmental  compliance with respect to facilities
outside  the U.S. are expected to be approximately $82 million in 2002 and $83
million  in  2003.    Operating  expenses  include pollution control equipment
operation  and  maintenance  costs,  governmental  payments,  and research and
engineering  costs.

Total  environmental  capital  expenditures  and  operating  expenses  are not
expected  to  have  a  material  effect on the Corporation's total capital and
operating  expenditures,  consolidated  earnings  or  competitive  position.
However,  current  environmental  spending  estimates  could  be modified as a
result of changes in the Corporation's plans, changes in legal requirements or
other  factors.




PART  I
(Continued)

ITEM  1. BUSINESS  (Continued)

In  connection with certain divestitures, including those described in "Recent
Developments,"  the  Corporation  has  agreed  to  indemnify the purchasers of
certain  divested  businesses  against  certain  environmental  liabilities.
Generally,  these  indemnification  obligations  apply  only  to environmental
liabilities  which  are  actually incurred by the purchaser within a specified
time  period  after  closing  and  are limited to a specified dollar amount of
coverage.    The  Corporation  has established appropriate accrued liabilities
with  respect thereto, and does not otherwise consider these obligations to be
material.

EMPLOYEES.    In  its  worldwide  consolidated operations, the Corporation had
64,200  employees  as  of  December  31,  2001.

Approximately  22  percent  of  the  Corporation's United States workforce and
approximately  25 percent of the Corporation's workforce outside of the United
States  are  represented by unions.  In the U.S., the largest concentration of
union  membership  is  with  the  Paper,  Allied-Industrial, Chemical & Energy
Workers  International  Union  (PACE).  Other employees are represented by the
International  Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers  (IBEW), the International
Association  of  Machinists  and  Aerospace  Workers (IAM), the Association of
Western  Pulp  and Paper Workers (AWPPW), the United Brotherhood of Carpenters
and  Joiners  and  various  independent  unions.  The Corporation's collective
bargaining  agreements  in  the U.S. typically have a term of 5 to 6 years and
provide for wage and fringe benefit increases during the term.  The agreements
have  staggered  termination  dates.

INSURANCE.    The  Corporation  maintains  coverage  consistent  with industry
practice  for  most  risks  that  are  incident  to  its  operations.


FACTORS  THAT  MAY  AFFECT  FUTURE  RESULTS

Certain  matters  discussed in this Form 10-K, or documents a portion of which
are  incorporated  herein  by  reference,  concerning, among other things, the
business  outlook,  anticipated  financial  and operating results, strategies,
contingencies  and  contemplated  transactions  of  the Corporation constitute
forward-looking  statements  and  are based upon management's expectations and
beliefs concerning future events impacting the Corporation.  There can be no
assurance that  these  events  will  occur  or that the Corporation's results
will be as estimated.

The  following  factors,  as  well as factors described elsewhere in this Form
10-K,  or  in  other  SEC filings, among others, could cause the Corporation's
future  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in  any
forward-looking  statements  made  by,  or  on  behalf  of,  the  Corporation.

Such  factors  are  described in accordance with the provisions of the Private
Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  which  encourages companies to
disclose  such  factors.

COMPETITIVE  ENVIRONMENT.  The Corporation experiences intense competition for
sales  of  its  principal products in its major markets, both domestically and
internationally.    The Corporation's products compete with widely advertised,
well-known,  branded  products,  as  well as private label products, which are
typically sold at lower prices.  The Corporation has several major competitors
in most of its markets, some of which are larger and more diversified than the
Corporation.   The principal methods and elements of competition include brand
recognition  and  loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price,
and  marketing  and  distribution  capabilities.    Inherent  risks  in  the
Corporation's



PART  I

ITEM  1. BUSINESS  (Continued)

competitive  strategy  include  uncertainties  concerning  trade  and consumer
acceptance, the effects of recent consolidations of retailers and distribution
channels,  and competitive reaction.  Aggressive competitive reaction may lead
to  increased advertising and promotional spending by the Corporation in order
to  maintain market share. Increased competition with respect to pricing would
reduce revenue and could have an adverse impact on the Corporation's financial
results.    In  addition,  the  Corporation  relies  on  the  development  and
introduction  of  new  or  improved  products  as  a means of achieving and/or
maintaining  category  leadership.    In  order  to  maintain  its competitive
position,  the  Corporation  must  develop technology to support its products.

COST  SAVING STRATEGY.  A significant portion of the Corporation's anticipated
cost  savings  are  expected  to result from operating efficiencies, including
those  anticipated  to  be  derived  from  the  Corporation's  Go-To-Market
initiatives  that  are  intended  to drive costs out of its supply chain.  The
Corporation's  information system upgrades are an integral part of that series
of  initiatives.    There  can  be  no  assurance  that  such cost savings and
efficiencies  will  be  achieved.

RAW  MATERIALS.  Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber,
is  used  extensively  in  the  Corporation's tissue and paper products and is
subject  to  significant  price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the
pulp  markets.    Recycled  fiber accounts for approximately 25 percent of the
Corporation's  overall  fiber  requirements.    On  a  worldwide  basis,  the
Corporation  has  reduced  its  internal  supply  of  pulp to approximately 40
percent  of  its  virgin  fiber  requirements.

The  Corporation  still  intends to reduce its level of pulp integration, when
market conditions permit, to approximately 20 percent, and such a reduction in
pulp  integration, if accomplished, could increase the Corporation's commodity
price risk.  Specifically, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the
Corporation's  earnings  if  selling  prices for its finished products are not
adjusted  or  if  such  adjustments  significantly trail the increases in pulp
prices.    Derivative  instruments  have  not been used to manage these risks.

Polymer  resins,  principally  polypropylene,  are  used  extensively  in  the
Corporation's  products,  such  as  diapers,  training  and  youth  pants, and
incontinence  care  products.    Polymer resins, which are principally derived
from  petroleum,  may  be  subject  to  price  fluctuations.   The Corporation
purchases polymer resins from a number of suppliers.  Significant increases in
resin  prices  could  adversely  affect  the Corporation's earnings if selling
prices  for  its  finished  products  are  not  adjusted  or  if  adjustments
significantly  trail  the  increases  in  resin  prices.

ENERGY COSTS.  The Corporation's manufacturing operations utilize electricity,
natural  gas  and  petroleum-based fuels.  To insure that it uses all forms of
energy  cost-effectively,  the Corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency
improvement  programs  at  all  of  its  manufacturing sites and also provides
expert  staff  assistance  to operating units in negotiating favorable utility
and  other  energy supply agreements.  The Corporation's contracts with energy
suppliers  vary  as  to  price,  payment  terms, quantities  and  duration.
Kimberly-Clark's energy costs are also affected by various  market  factors
including  the  availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy
prices and local and national regulatory decisions.  There can be no assurance
that  the  Corporation  will be fully protected against substantial changes in
the  price or availability of energy sources.  Derivative instruments are used
to  hedge  natural  gas  price risk when management deems it prudent to do so.
See  also "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for discussion of Mobile Energy Services
Company,  LLC.

ITEM  1. BUSINESS  (Continued)

ACQUISITION  STRATEGY.    The  Corporation's anticipated financial results and
business  outlook  are  dependent  in  part  upon the availability of suitable
acquisition  candidates.    The  Corporation  could  encounter  significant
challenges  in  locating  suitable  acquisition candidates that are consistent
with  its  strategic  objectives and will contribute to its long-term success.
Furthermore,  there can be no assurance that any such acquired business can or
will  be successfully integrated with the Corporation's businesses in order to
provide  anticipated  synergies  and  earnings  growth.

VOLUME  FORECASTING.   The Corporation's anticipated financial results reflect
forecasts of future volume increases in the sales of its products.  Challenges
in  such  forecasting  include  anticipating  consumer preferences, estimating
sales  of new products, estimating changes in population characteristics (such
as  birth  rates  and  changes  in per capita income), anticipating changes in
technology  and estimating the acceptance of the Corporation's products in new
markets.  As a result, there can be no assurance that the Corporation's volume
increases  will  occur  as  estimated.

FOREIGN  MARKET  RISKS.  Because the Corporation and its equity companies have
manufacturing  facilities  in 42 countries and their products are sold in more
than 150 countries, the Corporation's results may be substantially affected by
foreign  market  risks.   The Corporation is subject to the impact of economic
and  political instability in developing countries.  The extremely competitive
situation  in  European  personal care and tissue markets, and the challenging
economic environments in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and developing countries in
eastern  Europe,  Asia  and  Latin  America,  may slow the Corporation's sales
growth and earnings potential.  In addition, the Corporation is subject to the
strengthening and weakening of various currencies against each other and local
currencies  versus  the  U.S.  dollar.    Transaction  exposure,  arising from
transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currency, is selectively
hedged  (through  foreign  currency  forward, swap and option contracts).  See
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis - Risk Sensitivity", contained in the
2001 Annual Report to Stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Translation exposure for the Corporation with respect to foreign operations is
generally  not hedged.  There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be
fully  protected  against  substantial  foreign  currency  fluctuations.

CONTINGENCIES.    The  costs  and  other  effects  of  pending  litigation and
administrative  actions  against  the  Corporation  cannot  be determined with
certainty.   Although management believes that no such proceedings will have a
material adverse effect on the Corporation, there can be no assurance that the
outcome  of  such  proceedings  will  be  as  expected.    See  "Item 3. Legal
Proceedings".

One  of  the  Corporation's  North  American  tissue mills has an agreement to
provide  its  local  utility  company a specified amount of electric power per
year  for  the  next  17 years.  In the event that the mill was shut down, the
Corporation  would  be  required  to  continue to operate the power generation
facility on  behalf  of its owner, the local utility company.  The net present
value of the  cost to fulfill this agreement as of December 31, 2001 is
estimated to be approximately  $85  million.  However, management considers the
probability of closure  of  this  mill  to  be  remote.

Management  believes that the Corporation's production facilities are suitable
for  their  purpose  and  adequate  to support its businesses.  The extent of
utilization  of individual facilities varies, but they generally operate at or
near  capacity,  except  in  certain  instances  such  as when new products or
technology  are  being  introduced or when mills are being shut down.  Certain
facilities  of the Corporation are being expanded.  Various facilities contain
pollution  control,  solid  waste disposal and other equipment which have been
financed  through  the issuance of industrial revenue or similar bonds and are
held  by  the  Corporation  under  lease  or  installment purchase agreements.

The  principal  facilities  of  the  Corporation  (including the Corporation's
equity  companies)  and  the  products  or  groups  of  products  made at such

ITEM  3. LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS

The  following  is  a  brief  description  of certain legal and administrative
proceedings  to  which  the  Corporation  or its subsidiaries is a party or to
which  the  Corporation's  or  its  subsidiaries'  properties  are subject. In
management's  opinion,  none  of  the  legal  and  administrative  proceedings
described  below,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate, is expected to have a
material  adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition or
results  of  operations.

Approximately 300 product liability lawsuits seeking monetary damages, in most
cases  of  an  unspecified  amount,  are  pending  in federal and state courts
against  Safeskin.    Safeskin  is  typically  one  of  several defendants who
manufacture  or  sell  natural  rubber  latex  gloves.   These lawsuits allege
injuries  ranging from  dermatitis to severe allergic reactions caused by the
residual chemicals or  latex proteins in gloves worn by health care workers and
other individuals while  performing  their  duties.   Safeskin has referred the
defense of these lawsuits  to  its  insurance  carriers.

In  1999,  prior  to  the  acquisition  of  Safeskin,  numerous  lawsuits
(collectively  the "Securities Actions") were filed in the U.S. District Court
for  the  Southern  District of California against Safeskin and certain of its
officers  and directors alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities  and  Exchange  Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.
The Securities Actions were brought by plaintiffs in their individual capacity
and  on  behalf  of  a  purported  class of persons who purchased or otherwise
acquired  Safeskin publicly traded securities during various periods occurring
prior  to  the  Corporation's  acquisition of Safeskin.  The suits allege that
plaintiffs  purchased  Safeskin  securities at prices artificially inflated by
defendants'  misrepresentations  and omissions concerning Safeskin's financial
condition  and  prospects  and  seek  an  unspecified  amount  of  damages.
Defendants'  motion  to  dismiss  was  denied.  A  plaintiffs'  class has been
certified  consisting of those who purchased Safeskin common stock and options
during  the  period  of  February  18,  1998  to  March 11, 1999. Discovery is
continuing  and  the  Corporation  continues  to  contest  liability.

In addition, a shareholder derivative action has been filed against certain of
Safeskin's  directors,  and  Safeskin  as  a nominal defendant, in the Supreme
Court  of the State of California, San Diego County (the "Derivative Action").
The  Derivative  Action  alleges  breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate
assets  and  gross  negligence  in connection with Safeskin's stock repurchase
program  and  seeks an unspecified amount of damages.  The court has continued
discovery  in  the Derivative Action so that it can be completed following the
resolution  of  the  Securities  Actions.

ITEM  3. LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  (Continued)

On April 14, 2000, a complaint was filed by Anne Meader and others against the
Corporation  and  others  in  the  State  of  Maine  Superior Court.  Eighteen
plaintiffs  seek  compensation  for  injuries  allegedly caused by exposure to
substances  allegedly  emitted  by  the defendants' mills, including two mills
formerly  owned  by  the  Corporation,  and  from  the  Central Maine Disposal
Landfill  in  Fairfield,  Maine.    The  Corporation  is contesting the claims
asserted  by  the  plaintiffs.

Since  1998,  the  Corporation  has been involved in a series of complex legal
disputes  between  the  Corporation and Mobile Energy Services Company, L.L.C.
and  related  parties  ("MESC").  These disputes arose from the closure of the
Corporation's  Mobile  pulp  mill.    MESC  owns  a  cogeneration complex that
provides  energy  services  to  the  Corporation's  Mobile  mill.

In 1998, the Corporation decided to close its Mobile pulp mill and gave notice
to  MESC of its intent to terminate a long-term energy services agreement.  In
January  1999,  MESC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and brought an
adversary  proceeding  in  the  United  States  Bankruptcy  Court  against the
Corporation  claiming  unspecified  damages  arising from the mill closure and
termination  of  the  energy  services  agreement.

In  March  2001,  an  arbitration  ruling  was  issued.    In that ruling, the
arbitrator  rejected  MESC's  claims  related to the pulp mill closure finding
that  the  Corporation  had affected a proper pulp mill closure.  However, the
arbitrator  also ruled that the operation of certain assets by the Corporation
after  the  pulp mill closure permitted MESC to reinstate the pulp mill energy
services  agreement.  This reinstatement became subject to binding arbitration
brought by MESC in April 2001.  A ruling issued in this arbitration on January
31,  2002  resulted  in  the  Corporation  recording  a  pre-tax  charge  of
approximately  $27  million  in  its  2001  earnings.

In  addition,  MESC  submitted binding arbitration claims for reimbursement by
the  Corporation  of  certain  capital  and  energy costs incurred by MESC.  A
ruling  issued  in  this  arbitration  on  January  21,  2002  resulted in the
Corporation  recording  a  pre-tax  charge of approximately $17 million in its
2001  earnings.

Of the numerous allegations made against the Corporation in the 1999 adversary
proceeding,  only    fraudulent  transfer  claims  remain  pending  before the
Bankruptcy  Court.    In  addition,  MESC  subsequently filed three additional
adversary  proceedings and one arbitration proceeding against the Corporation.
The  Corporation  continues  to  contest  vigorously  MESC's  various  claims.

As of March 1, 2002, the Corporation, along with numerous other non-affiliated
companies,  was  a party to approximately 105 lawsuits in California, Florida,
Georgia,  Illinois,  Louisiana,  Mississippi, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas
state  courts  with  allegations  of  personal  injury resulting from asbestos
exposure  on  the  defendants' premises and/or allegations that the defendants
manufactured,  sold,  distributed  or  installed  products  which  cause
asbestos-related  lung  disease.  No specific product ever manufactured by the
Corporation  or  its  subsidiaries  has  been  identified by the plaintiffs as
having  caused  or  contributed  to  any  asbestos-related  lung  disease. The
Corporation  has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of
these  asbestos  cases.  All  asbestos  cases  have  been  tendered  to  the
Corporation's  insurance  carriers  for  defense  and  indemnity.

The  Corporation  is  subject  to routine litigation from time to time, which,
individually  or  in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse
effect  on  the  Corporation's  business,  financial  condition  or results of
operations.

Environmental  Matters
- ----------------------

The  Corporation  is  subject  to  federal,  state  and  local  environmental
protection laws and regulations with respect to its business operations and is
operating  in  compliance  with, or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance
with,  such  laws and regulations.  Compliance with these laws and regulations
is  not  expected  to  have  a  material  adverse  effect on the Corporation's
business,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.

The  Corporation  has  been  named  a  potentially responsible party under the
provisions  of  the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and  Liability  Act,  or  analogous  state  statutes, at  a  number  of  waste
disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate,  in
management's  opinion,  is  likely  to have a material adverse effect  on  the
Corporation's  business,  financial  condition  or results of operations.

Notwithstanding its opinion, management believes it appropriate to discuss the
following  matters  concerning  two  of  these  sites  where the Corporation's
estimated  share  of  total  site  remediation  costs, if any, cannot be
established on the basis of currently available information:

     A.  In  1994,  Scott  received  a  notice  of  responsibility from the
         Massachusetts  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  regarding
         the South Hadley  Site  in  South  Hadley,  Massachusetts. The notice
         implicated Scott Graphics, Inc., a former Scott subsidiary, as having
         disposed  of  hazardous  waste  at  the  site.    There  have  been no
         significant  developments  since the date the Corporation received the
         notice.

     B.  In  January  1998,  the  Corporation was notified by the Tennessee
         Department  of  Environment  and  Conservation  of its status as a
         potentially liable  party  at  the  Bellevue  Avenue Landfill in Shelby
         County, Tennessee. There  have  been  no significant developments since
         the date the Corporation received  the  notice.
