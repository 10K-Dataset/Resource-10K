KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION -

2019 Annual Report

PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Kimberly-Clark Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. We are a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life through product innovation and building our personal care, consumer tissue and K-C Professional brands.  We are principally engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of a wide range of products mostly made from natural or synthetic fibers using advanced technologies in fibers, nonwovens and absorbency.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "Corporation," "Kimberly-Clark," "K-C," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.

Description of Kimberly-Clark

We are organized into operating segments based on product groupings.  These operating segments have been aggregated into three reportable global business segments as follows:

•

Personal Care

brands offer our consumers a trusted partner in caring for themselves and their families by delivering confidence, protection and discretion through a wide variety of innovative solutions and products such as disposable diapers, training and youth pants, swimpants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products, and other related products.  Products in this segment are sold under the Huggies, Pull-Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites, DryNites, Kotex, U by Kotex, Intimus, Depend, Plenitud, Poise and other brand names.

•

Consumer Tissue

offers a wide variety of innovative solutions and trusted brands that responsibly improve everyday living for families around the world.  Products in this segment include facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products, and are sold under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, Viva, Andrex, Scottex, Neve and other brand names.

•

K-C Professional

("KCP") partners with businesses to create Exceptional Workplaces, helping to make them healthier, safer and more productive through a range of solutions and supporting products such as wipers, tissue, towels, apparel, soaps and sanitizers.  Our brands, including Kleenex, Scott, WypAll, Kimtech and KleenGuard are well known for quality and trusted to help people around the world work better.

These reportable segments were determined in accordance with how our chief operating decision maker and our executive managers develop and execute our global strategies to drive growth and profitability of our personal care, consumer tissue and KCP operations.  These strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management and capacity, and capital investments for each of these businesses.

Products for household use are sold directly to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, drugstores, warehouse clubs, variety and department stores and other retail outlets, as well as through other distributors and e-commerce.  Products for away-from-home use are sold through distributors and directly to manufacturing, lodging, office building, food service, and high-volume public facilities.

Net sales to Walmart Inc. as a percent of our consolidated net sales were approximately

14 percent

in


,


and


.

Patents and Trademarks

We own various patents and trademarks registered domestically and in many foreign countries.  We consider the patents and trademarks that we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products to be material to our business.  Consequently, we seek patent and trademark protection by all available means, including registration.

Raw Materials

Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or fiber recycled from recovered waste paper, is the primary raw material for our tissue products, and in the form of fluff pulp is a component of disposable diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads and incontinence care products.

Polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics, which are used in disposable diapers, training and youth pants, wet wipes, feminine pads, incontinence care products, and away-from-home wipers and apparel.  Superabsorbent materials are important components of disposable diapers, training and youth pants and incontinence care products.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

Raw materials are purchased from third parties, and we consider the supply to be adequate to meet the needs of our businesses.  See Item 1A, "Risk Factors."

Competition

We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which are larger and more diversified than us.  The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities.  For additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors."

Foreign Market Risks

We operate and market our products globally, and our business strategy includes targeted growth in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with a particular emphasis in China, Eastern Europe, ASEAN and Latin America.  See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for a discussion of foreign market risks that may affect our financial results.

Environmental Matters

Total capital expenditures for voluntary environmental controls or controls necessary to comply with legal requirements relating to the protection of the environment at our facilities are expected to be $33 and $34 in


and


, respectively.  Total operating expenses for environmental compliance, including pollution control equipment operation and maintenance costs, governmental fees, and research and engineering costs are expected to be $113 in


and $114 in


.

Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, consolidated earnings or competitive position.  Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans, changes in legal requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors.

Employees

In our consolidated operations, we had approximately 40,000 employees as of

December 31, 2019

.

Available Information

The information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the SEC.  Stockholders may also contact Stockholder Services, P.O. Box 612606, Dallas, Texas 75261-2606 or call 972-281-5317 to obtain a hard copy of these reports without charge.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

Our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control.  Any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this Form 10-K, or in our other filings with the SEC, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements.  These risks are not the only ones we face.  Other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us.

Increasing dependence on key retailers in Developed Markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business.

Our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers.  With the consolidation of retail trade, both traditional retailers and e-tailers, we are increasingly dependent on key customers, and some of these customers, including large-format retailers and large e-tailers, may have significant bargaining power.  They may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability.  We may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions.  If we lose a significant customer or if sales of


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

We operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products.  Inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, a growing e-commerce marketplace, and customers' and competitors' actions.  Our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers.  Some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices.  Alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price.  E-commerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry.   The actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results.  It may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results.

We may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products.  Demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions, consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to e-tailers, changing consumer preferences due to increased concerns in regard to post-consumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability, or other changes in consumer trends or habits.  If we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease.

Our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection.  In addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies.  The introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace.  If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position.  Some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions.  We may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products.  Also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition.

Our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results.

Our strategy includes operations growth outside the U.S., especially in developing markets such as China, Eastern Europe, ASEAN and Latin America.  About half of our net sales come from markets outside the U.S.  We and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in


countries, and sell products in more than


countries.  Our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks:

•

Exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the U.S. dollar.  A portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts where available and economically advantageous.  We do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations.

•

Increases in currency exchange restrictions.  These restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the U.S. or obtain currency exchange for U.S. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries.

•

Adverse political conditions.  Risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences, including the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), could adversely affect our financial results.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

•

Increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the U.S. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar.  There can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations.

The inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ("MD&A") and Item 8,

Note 1

to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Argentina.

Damage to the reputation of Kimberly-Clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business.

Developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others.  Our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) and other sustainability or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer.  In addition, our products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues.  Consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands.  Our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.

If our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, or we fail to comply with data privacy or similar regulations, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage.

Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business.  These systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks.  While we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.

Increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems.  Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act.  Any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, supplier, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business.  Any such event, or any failure to comply with these data privacy requirements or other laws in this area, could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability, or regulatory or other penalties.  In addition, we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events.

Significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation or other necessary supplies or services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results.

Increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

Cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations.  Cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products.  In past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility.  Increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices.  In some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility, but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks.

A number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum.  These materials are subject to price fluctuations based


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years.  We purchase these materials from a number of suppliers.  Significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials.

Our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels.  To ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites.  Our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration.  Our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses).  There can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources.

There can be no assurance that our efforts to increase selling prices in response to increased costs will be successful.

There is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.

We continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist.  In January  2018, we announced a global restructuring program.  The 2018 Global Restructuring Program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization.  In addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities.  We anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions.  Any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees, suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results.

Government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

As a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, product liability, environmental, intellectual property or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions.

If we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.  We cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents.  While it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image.

In addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business, including Brexit, which could adversely impact our financial results.  For example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials.

Disruption in our supply chain or our manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business

.

Our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations.  These activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, epidemics (including the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from China), pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products.  This interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address.

In addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services.  Disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our suppliers, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.

New or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

We are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally.  Many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies, including tax reform in the U.S. that was enacted in December 2017.  Other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity.  Increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may divest or acquire product lines or businesses, which could impact our results.

We may periodically divest product lines or businesses.  These divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses.  Furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products.

We may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns.  We may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future, or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.

The inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Introduction

This MD&A is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects.  This discussion and analysis compares


results to


. For a discussion that compares our 2018 results to 2017, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The reference to "N.M." indicates that the calculation is not meaningful.  In addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices on net sales.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exited businesses also impact the year-over-year change in net sales.  Dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.

The following will be discussed and analyzed:

Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

Throughout this MD&A, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures.  These measures include adjusted gross and operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate.  We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  There are limitations to these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.  We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to the GAAP measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures.

The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this MD&A:

•

2018 Global Restructuring Program - In 2018, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization.  See Item 8,

Note 2

to the consolidated financial statements for details.

•

Property Sale Gain - In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized a gain on the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed in 2012 as part of a past restructuring.

•

U.S. Tax Reform Related Matters - In 2018 we recognized a net charge associated with U.S. tax reform related matters.  See Item 8,

Note 11

to the consolidated financial statements for details.

Quarterly results in 2019 and 2018 were impacted by charges related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program.  See Item 8, Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Provided by Operations

Cash provided by operations was

$2.7 billion

in


compared to

$3.0 billion

in


.  The decrease was driven by increased working capital and tax payments, partially offset by higher earnings and lower pension contributions.

Obligations

The following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable.

•

The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp and utilities.  Although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.

•

The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery.

The table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain.  The following payments are not included in the table:

•

We will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately

$50

to these plans in


.

•

Other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations.  Based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately $60 through

•

Accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.

Investing

Our capital spending was

$1.2 billion

in


and $0.9 billion


, reflecting incremental spending in 2019 related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program.  Proceeds from dispositions of property in 2019 of $242 primarily reflects the proceeds from the sales of manufacturing facilities and associated real estate related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program and property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring.  We expect capital spending to be approximately $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion in 2020, including significant spending associated with the 2018 Global Restructuring Program.

Financing

We issue long-term debt in the public market periodically.  Proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness.  See Item 8,

Note 4

to the consolidated financial statements for details.

Our short-term debt, which consists of U.S. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-U.S. subsidiaries, was

$775

as of

December 31, 2019

(included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet).  The average month-end balance of short-term debt for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2019

was

$1.0

billion.  These short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations.  The level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes.

At

December 31, 2019

, total debt was

$7.7 billion

compared to

$7.5 billion

at

December 31, 2018

.

In February 2020, we issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 2.875% notes due February 7, 2050.  Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of a portion of our commercial paper indebtedness.

We maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in June 2023 and a $750 revolving credit facility which expires in June 2020.  These facilities, currently unused, support our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.

We paid $1.4 billion in dividends in 2019.  The Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 3.9 percent for 2020.  We repurchase shares of Kimberly-Clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.  During


, we repurchased

6.2 million

shares of our common stock at a cost of

$800

through a broker in the open market.  We are targeting full-year


share repurchases between $700 and $900, subject to market conditions.

We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, payments for our 2018 Global Restructuring Program, capital spending, pension contributions, dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future.  Further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period.  The critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used.  The critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments.  These critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances

Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products.  Rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales.  Promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs.  Generally, the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories, and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized.  Our related accounting policies are discussed in Item 8,

Note 1

to the consolidated financial statements.

Employee Postretirement Benefits

Substantially all regular employees in the U.S. and the United Kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain U.S. and United Kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit (the "Principal Plans").  Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees.  Our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in Item 8,

Note 6

to the consolidated financial statements.

Changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations:

•

Long-term rate of return on plan assets

.  The expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis.  In setting these assumptions, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation.  Actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately

$1.2 billion

.  These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required

.

If the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the Principal Plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2020.

•

Discount rate

.  The discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligation at

December 31, 2019

was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan.  For the United Kingdom plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities.  Each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations.   If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in


, and the December 31, 2019 pension liability would increase by about

$130

.

•

Other assumptions

.  There are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections.

Pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate

$105

in


, including incremental charges resulting from 2018 Global Restructuring Program actions.  Pension expense beyond


will depend on future investment performance,


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans.

Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans.  Changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate:

•

Discount rate

.  The determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation.  If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the impact to


other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the December 31, 2019 benefit liability would not be material.

•

Health care cost trend rate

.  The health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace.

Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments

As a global organization, we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally.  Changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the U.S. and uncertain tax positions.  Our income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in Item 8,

Note 11

to the consolidated financial statements.

•

Deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances

.  We have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets.  These carryforwards are primarily in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the U.S.  Foreign tax credits earned in the U.S. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets.  In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction.  A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

•

Undistributed earnings

.  As of December 31, 2019, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately

$7.7 billion

.  Earnings of

$5.6 billion

were previously subject to tax, primarily due to the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Any additional taxes due with respect to such previously-taxed earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to foreign and U.S. state income taxes.  Deferred taxes have been recorded on

$0.9 billion

of earnings, most of which were previously taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated.  We do not intend to distribute the remaining

$4.7 billion

of previously taxed foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and U.S. state income taxes on such earnings.  While the transition tax resulted in a reduction of the excess amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, any remaining amount of financial reporting over tax basis after such reduction could be subject to additional taxes, if repatriated.  However, we consider any excess to be indefinitely reinvested.  The determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the

$4.7 billion

of previously taxed foreign earnings is not practicable.

•

Uncertain tax positions

.  We record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns.  Where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter.  These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations.

New Accounting Standards

See Item 8,

Note 1

to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements.

Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

Certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook, including the anticipated cost savings from our FORCE program, costs and savings from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program, cash flow and uses of cash, growth initiatives, innovations, marketing and other spending, net sales, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including the impact in Argentina, raw material, energy and other input costs, effective tax rate, contingencies and anticipated transactions of Kimberly-Clark, including dividends, share repurchases and pension contributions, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting Kimberly-Clark.  There can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them.

The assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases.  In addition, many factors outside our control, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the prices and availability of our raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, our ability to maintain key customer relationships and retail trade customer actions, as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, could affect the realization of these estimates.

The factors described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K, or in our other SEC filings, among others, could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.  A variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments.  Derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation.  Foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions.  Our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date.  Credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions.

Presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices.  These analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period.  Also included is a description of our commodity price risk.

Foreign Currency Risk

A portion of our foreign currency risk is managed through the systematic use of foreign currency forward contracts.  The use of these instruments supports the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, gains or losses on the underlying foreign currency exposure.  We also utilize cross currency swaps and foreign denominated debt to hedge certain investments in foreign subsidiaries.  The gain or loss on these instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income to offset the change in value of the net investments being hedged.

Foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  An annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end.  The balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

As of

December 31, 2019

, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  This hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the

December 31, 2019

rates and the assumed rates.

Our operations in Argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the U.S. dollar.  Changes in the value of an Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar applied to our net peso monetary position are recorded in Other (income) and expense, net at the time of the change.  As of December 31, 2019, K-C Argentina had a small net peso monetary position and a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not be material.

The translation of the balance sheets of non-U.S. operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-U.S. operations into U.S. dollars.  These translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("UTA") within stockholders' equity.  The hypothetical change in UTA is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-U.S. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates.  As of

December 31, 2019

, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately

$550

.  In the view of management, the above potential UTA adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed-rate debt composed of short and long-term instruments.  The objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate.  At

December 31, 2019

, the long-term debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixed-rate debt.  F

rom time to time, we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt and those contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.

In order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations,  we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixed-rate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments.  At

December 31, 2019

, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about

$210

, which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value.

Commodity Price Risk

We are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp.  Selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp.  As previously discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices.  In some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures, including fixed price contracts, to manage volatility for a portion of our commodity costs, but derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks.

Our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions.  As previously discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources.  In addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, used in our manufacturing operations.  Derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk.

Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements present the accounts of Kimberly-Clark Corporation and all subsidiaries in which it has a controlling financial interest as if they were a single economic entity in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  All intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.  The terms "Corporation," "Kimberly-Clark," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Kimberly-Clark Corporation and all subsidiaries in which it has a controlling financial interest.  Dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known.  Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, employee postretirement benefits, and deferred income taxes and potential assessments.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are short-term investments with an original maturity date of three months or less.

Inventories and Distribution Costs

Most U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using the Last-In, First-Out ("LIFO") method, or market.  The balance of the U.S. inventories and inventories of consolidated operations outside the U.S. are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using either the First-In, First-Out ("FIFO") or weighted-average cost methods.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  Distribution costs are classified as cost of products sold.

Property and Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method.  Buildings are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, primarily


years

.  Machinery and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, primarily ranging from


to


years

.  Purchases of computer software, including external costs and certain internal costs (including payroll and payroll-related costs of employees) directly associated with developing significant computer software applications for internal use, are capitalized.  Computer software costs are amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which generally does not exceed


years

.

Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when warranted, changes are made to them.  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss would be indicated when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset group, which are identifiable and largely independent of the cash flows of other asset groups, are less than the carrying amount of the asset group.  Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.  Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.  When property is sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any gain or loss on the transaction is included in income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is assessed for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.  Impairment testing compares the reporting unit carrying amount, including goodwill, with its fair value.  Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows. If the reporting unit carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge for the excess amount above fair value would be recorded.   For


, we completed the required


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all of our reporting units using the first day of the third quarter as the measurement date and determined through quantitative impairment testing that goodwill is not impaired.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss would be indicated when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount.

An impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the fair value (based on discounted future cash flows) and the carrying amount of the asset.  Estimated useful lives range from


to


years

for trademarks and


to


years

for patents, developed technologies and other intangible assets.

Investments in Equity Companies

Investments in companies which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence and that, in general, are at least


percent-owned by us, are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income.  These investments are evaluated for impairment when warranted.  An impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary.  In judging "other than temporary," we would consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the equity company investment has been less than the carrying amount, the near-term and longer-term operating and financial prospects of the equity company, and our longer-term intent of retaining the investment in the equity company.

Revenue Recognition

Sales revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment or delivery, depending on when control passes, to unaffiliated customers, and when all of the following have occurred: a firm sales agreement is in place, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  Sales are reported net of returns, consumer and trade promotions, rebates and freight allowed.  Taxes imposed by governmental authorities on our revenue-producing activities with customers, such as sales taxes and value-added taxes, are excluded from net sales.

Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances

The cost of promotion activities provided to customers is classified as a reduction in sales revenue.  In addition, the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized.  Rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales. Promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed in the year the related advertisement or campaign is first presented through traditional or digital media.  For interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related advertising expense for the full year.

Research Expense

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Foreign Currency Translation

The income statements of foreign operations, other than those in highly inflationary economies, are translated into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange in effect each month.  The balance sheets of these operations are translated at period-end exchange rates, and the differences from historical exchange rates are reflected in stockholders' equity as unrealized translation adjustments.

As of July 1, 2018, we elected to adopt highly inflationary accounting for our subsidiaries in Argentina (“K-C Argentina”).  The effect of changes in exchange rates on peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities has been reflected in earnings in Other (income) and expense, net and was not material.  As of December 31, 2019, K-C Argentina had a small net peso monetary position.  Net sales of K-C Argentina were approximately


percent of our consolidated net sales in 2019 and 2018

.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

Our policies allow the use of derivatives for risk management purposes and prohibit their use for speculation.  Our policies also prohibit the use of any leveraged derivative instrument.  Consistent with our policies, foreign currency derivative instruments, interest rate swaps and locks, and the majority of commodity hedging contracts are entered into with major financial institutions.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

At inception, we formally designate certain derivatives as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and establish how the effectiveness of these hedges will be assessed and measured.  This process links the derivatives to the transactions or financial balances they are hedging.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in earnings as they occur.  All derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are either recorded in the income statement or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.  The gain or loss on derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are included in income in the period that changes in fair value occur.  The gain or loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is included in other comprehensive income in the period that changes in fair value occur, and is reclassified to income in the same period that the hedged item affects income.  The gain or loss on derivatives designated as hedges of investments in foreign subsidiaries is recognized in other comprehensive income to offset the change in value of the net investments being hedged.  Certain foreign-currency derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments have been entered into to manage certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.  The gain or loss on these derivatives is included in income in the period that changes in their fair values occur.  Cash flows from derivatives are classified within the consolidated statement of cash flows in the same category as the items being hedged.  Cash flows from derivatives are classified within Operating Activities, except for derivatives designated as net investment hedges which are classified in Investing Activities.  See

Note 10

for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Leases

Lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement of an arrangement where it is determined at inception that a lease exists.  Lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.  These assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term calculated using our incremental borrowing rate generally applicable to the location of the lease asset, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable.  Lease assets also include any upfront lease payments made and exclude lease incentives.  Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised.

Variable lease payments are generally expensed as incurred and include certain index-based changes in rent, certain nonlease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor, and other charges included in the lease.  Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and the expense for these short-term leases and for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Certain lease agreements with lease and nonlease components are combined as a single lease component.  The depreciable life of lease assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.

Accounting Standards - Adopted During 2019

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842),

amended by ASU 2018-11,

Leases

(Topic 842): Targeted Improvements

.  The new guidance requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months and provide additional disclosures.  The ASU requires adoption using a modified retrospective transition approach with either 1) periods prior to the adoption date being recast or 2) a cumulative-effect adjustment recognized to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date with prior periods not recast.  We adopted this standard on January 1, 2019 using the cumulative-effect adjustment approach.  We elected the package of practical expedients in transition for leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019 whereby these contracts were not reassessed or reclassified from their previous assessment as of December 31, 2018.  We also elected certain other practical expedients in transition including not reassessing existing land easements as lease contracts.  For all new and modified leases after adoption of the ASU, we have taken the component election allowing us to generally account for lease components together with nonlease components in the calculation of the lease asset and corresponding liability.  We implemented processes and a lease accounting system to ensure adequate internal controls were in place to assess our contracts and enable proper accounting and reporting of financial information upon adoption.  No cumulative-effect adjustment was recognized as the amount was not material, and the impact on our results of operations and cash flows was also not material.  See

Note 8

for the financial position impact and additional disclosures.

The FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,

Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

.

The

new standard makes more financial and non-financial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting.  It also amends presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess hedge effectiveness.  This ASU requires


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

adoption using a modified retrospective transition approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment recognized to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date with prior periods not recast.  We adopted this standard on January 1, 2019 with no cumulative-effect adjustment as the amount was not material.  The effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows were not material.

The FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13,

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)

.  The new guidance modifies disclosure requirements related to fair value measurement.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Implementation on a prospective or retrospective basis varies by specific disclosure requirement.  We early adopted this standard as of July 1, 2019 on a prospective basis.  The impact on our disclosures was not material.

Accounting Standards Issued - Not Adopted as of December 31, 2019

The FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40).

The new guidance reduces complexity for the accounting for costs of implementing a cloud computing service arrangement and aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).  We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis.  The effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows were not material.

The FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740):  Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.  The new guidance simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, hybrid taxes and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences.  It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes.  For public companies, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted in interim or annual periods with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period.  Additionally, entities that elect early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period.  Amendments are to be applied prospectively, except for certain amendments that are to be applied either retrospectively or with a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings.  The effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows are not expected to be material.

2018 Global Restructuring Program

In January 2018, we announced the 2018 Global Restructuring Program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization.  We expect to close or sell approximately


manufacturing facilities and expand production capacity at several others.  We expect to exit or divest some lower-margin businesses that generate approximately


percent of our net sales.  The restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies.  Workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of

5,000

to

5,500

.  Certain capital appropriations under the 2018 Global Restructuring Program are being finalized.  Accounting for actions related to each appropriation will commence when the appropriation is authorized for execution.

The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of


, with total costs anticipated to be

$

1.7

billion to

$

1.9

billion pre-tax (

$

1.3

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

The following net charges were incurred in connection with the 2018 Global Restructuring Program:

(a)

Other (income) and expense, net in 2019 was the result of pre-tax gains on the sales of manufacturing facilities and associated real estate which were disposed of as part of the restructuring.

(b)

Represents non-cash pension settlement and curtailment charges resulting from restructuring actions, primarily in the U.S., United Kingdom and Canada.

The asset impairments charge measurement was based on the excess of the carrying value of the impacted asset groups over their fair values.  These fair values were measured by using discounted cash flows expected over the limited time the assets would remain in use and as a result, the assets were essentially written off.  The use of discounted cash flows represents a level 3 measure under the fair value hierarchy.

The following summarizes the restructuring liabilities activity:

As of

December 31, 2019

Fair Value Information

The following fair value information is based on a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The three levels in the hierarchy used to measure fair value are:

Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets accessible at the reporting date for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not considered active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3—Prices or valuations that require inputs that are significant to the valuation and are unobservable.

A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

During


and


, there were no significant transfers to or from level 3 fair value determinations.

Derivative assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis at fair value.  At

December 31, 2019

and


, derivative assets were

$


and

$


, respectively, and derivative liabilities were

$


and

$


, respectively.  The fair values of derivatives used to manage interest rate risk and commodity price risk are based on LIBOR rates and interest rate swap curves and NYMEX price quotations, respectively.  The fair values of hedging instruments used to manage foreign currency risk are based on published quotations of spot currency rates and forward points, which are converted into implied forward currency rates.  Measurement of our derivative assets and liabilities is considered a level 2 measurement.  See

Note 10

for additional information on our use of derivative instruments.

Redeemable preferred securities of subsidiaries are measured on a recurring basis at fair value and were

$


and

$


at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  They are not traded in active markets.  For certain redeemable securities, fair values were calculated using a floating rate pricing model that compared the stated spread to the fair value spread to determine the price at which each of the financial instruments should trade.  The model used the following inputs to calculate fair values: face value, current LIBOR rate, unobservable fair value credit spread, stated spread, maturity date and interest or dividend payment dates.  The fair value of the remaining redeemable securities was based on a discounted cash flow valuation model.  Measurement of the redeemable preferred securities is considered a level 3 measurement.

Company-owned life insurance ("COLI") assets are measured on a recurring basis at fair value.  COLI assets were

$


and

$


at

December 31, 2019

, respectively.  The COLI policies are a source of funding primarily for our nonqualified employee benefits and are included in other assets. The COLI policies are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and therefore, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have a stock-based Equity Participation Plan and an Outside Directors' Compensation Plan (the "Plans"), under which we can grant stock options, restricted shares and restricted share units to employees and outside directors.  As of

December 31, 2019

, the number of shares of common stock available for grants under the Plans aggregated


million

shares.

Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and they have a term of


years.  Stock options are subject to graded vesting whereby options vest


percent at the end of each of the first two 12-month periods following the grant and


percent

at the end of the third 12-month period.

Restricted shares, time-vested restricted share units and performance-based restricted share units granted to employees are valued at the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date and vest generally at the end of

three years

.  The number of performance-based share units that ultimately vest ranges from

zero

to


percent

of the number granted, based on performance tied to return on invested capital ("ROIC") and net sales during the three-year performance period.  ROIC and net sales targets are set at the beginning of the performance period.  Restricted share units granted to outside directors are valued at the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date and vest when they are granted.  The restricted period begins on the date of grant and expires on the date the outside director retires from or otherwise terminates service on our Board.

At the time stock options are exercised or restricted shares and restricted share units become payable, common stock is issued from our accumulated treasury shares.  Dividend equivalents are credited on restricted share units on the same date and at the same rate as dividends are paid on Kimberly-Clark's common stock.  These dividend equivalents, net of estimated forfeitures, are charged to retained earnings.

Stock-based compensation costs of

$


,

$


and

$


and related deferred income tax benefits of

,


and


, respectively.

The fair value of stock option awards was determined using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model utilizing a range of assumptions related to dividend yield, volatility, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior.  Dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future dividend actions.  Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options on Kimberly-Clark's common stock.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  We estimate forfeitures based on historical data.

The weighted-average fair value of options granted was estimated at

Employee Postretirement Benefits

Substantially all regular employees in the U.S. and the United Kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain U.S. and United Kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit (the "Principal Plans").  Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees.  The funding policy for our qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute assets at least equal in amount to regulatory minimum requirements.  Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded.

Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans.  The annual increase in the consolidated weighted-average health care cost trend rate is expected to be

5.8

percent in


and to decline to

4.5

percent in


and thereafter.  Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the amounts reported for postretirement health care benefit plans.

As a result of restructuring actions related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program, aggregate pension settlement charges of

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

Summarized financial information about postretirement plans, excluding defined contribution retirement plans, is presented below:

(a)

The actuarial net losses in 2019 and the actuarial net gains in 2018 were primarily due to discount rate decreases in 2019 and discount rate increases in 2018.

Substantially all of the funded status of pension and other benefits is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet in Noncurrent Employee Benefits, with the remainder recognized in Accrued Expenses and other current liabilities and Other Assets.

Information for the Principal Plans and All Other Pension Plans

Approximately one-half of the PBO and fair value of plan assets for the Principal Plans relate to the U.S. qualified and nonqualified pension plans.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost

(a)

The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the fair value of plan assets at the remeasurement date, typically the prior year-end adjusted for estimated current year cash benefit payments and contributions, by the expected long-term rate of return.

The components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item Nonoperating expense in our consolidated income statement.

Weighted-Average Assumptions Used to Determine Net Periodic Benefit Cost for Years Ended December 31

Weighted-Average Assumptions Used to Determine Benefit Obligations at December 31

Investment Strategies for the Principal Plans

Strategic asset allocation decisions are made considering several risk factors, including plan participants' retirement benefit security, the estimated payments of the associated liabilities, the plan funded status, and Kimberly-Clark's financial condition.  The resulting strategic asset allocation is a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.  Equity investments are typically diversified across geographies and market capitalization.  Fixed income investments are diversified across multiple sectors including government issues and corporate debt instruments with a portfolio duration that is consistent with the estimated payment of the associated liability.  Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the strategic allocation when considered appropriate.  Our


target plan asset allocation for the Principal Plans is approximately


percent fixed income securities and


percent equity securities.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

The expected long-term rate of return is generally evaluated on an annual basis.  In setting this assumption, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the current asset allocation.  The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the Principal Plans was

4.59

percent in


,

4.75

percent in


and

4.72

percent in 2017, and will be

3.76

percent in


.

Set forth below are the pension plan assets of the Principal Plans measured at fair value, by level in the fair-value hierarchy.  More than 70 percent of the assets are held in pooled funds and are measured using a net asset value (or its equivalent).  Accordingly, such assets do not meet the Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 criteria of the fair value hierarchy.

Futures contracts are used when appropriate to manage duration targets.  As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the U.S. plan held directly Treasury futures contracts with a total notional value of approximately

$


and

$


, respectively, and an insignificant fair value.  As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the United Kingdom plan held through a pooled fund future contracts with a total notional value of approximately

$


and

$


, and an insignificant fair value.

During


and


, the plan assets did not include a significant amount of Kimberly-Clark common stock.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

Inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets vary according to the type of security being valued.  Substantially all of the equity securities held directly by the plans are actively traded and fair values are determined based on quoted market prices.  Fair values of U.S. government securities are determined based on trading activity in the marketplace.

Fair values of U.S. corporate debt, U.S. municipals and international bonds are typically determined by reference to the values of similar securities traded in the marketplace and current interest rate levels.  Multiple pricing services are typically employed to assist in determining these valuations.

Fair values of equity securities and fixed income securities held through units of pooled funds are based on net asset value of the units of the pooled fund determined by the fund manager.  Pooled funds are similar in nature to retail mutual funds, but are typically more efficient for institutional investors.  The fair value of pooled funds is determined by the value of the underlying assets held by the fund and the units outstanding.

Equity securities held directly by the pension trusts and those held through units in pooled funds are monitored as to issuer and industry.  Except for U.S. Treasuries, concentrations of fixed income securities are similarly monitored for concentrations by issuer and industry.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

there were no significant concentrations of equity or debt securities in any single issuer or industry.

No level 3 transfers (in or out) were made in 2019 or 2018.  Fair values of insurance contracts are based on an evaluation of various factors, including purchase price.

Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into Cost of products sold, Nonoperating expense, Interest expense, or Other (income) and expense, net, as applicable, in the consolidated income statement.

Net unrealized currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, except those in highly inflationary economies, are recorded in AOCI.  For these operations, changes in exchange rates generally do not affect cash flows; therefore, unrealized translation adjustments are recorded in AOCI rather than net income.  Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of any of these subsidiaries, the applicable unrealized translation adjustment would be removed from AOCI and reported as part of the gain or loss on the sale or liquidation.  The change in unrealized translation in


is primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar.  Also included in unrealized translation amounts are the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature and transactions designated as hedges of net foreign investments.

Legal Matters

We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inquiries, inspections, audits or investigations pertaining to issues such as contract disputes, product liability, tax matters, patents and trademarks, advertising, pricing, business practices, governmental regulations, employment and other matters.

We are party to certain legal proceedings relating to our former health care business, Avanos Medical, Inc. ("Avanos", previously Halyard Health, Inc.), which we spun-off on October 31, 2014, including civil actions, consumer class actions, qui tam matters, a shareholder derivative suit, a securities class action and certain subpoena and document requests from the federal government.

The health care matters include Bahamas Surgery Center v. Kimberly-Clark Corporation, et al., a California consumer class action relating to the sale of surgical gowns.  In April 2017, the jury awarded the plaintiff class

$

3.9

in compensatory damages and

$


in punitive damages against us.  During the first quarter of 2018, the Court reduced the punitive damages award to approximately

$


.  As a result, the total compensatory and punitive damages plus pre-judgment interest awarded against Kimberly-Clark is approximately

$


.  We intend to continue our vigorous defense of the Bahamas matter.

We also have received subpoenas from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) concerning allegations of potential criminal and civil violations of federal laws, including the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in connection with the manufacturing, marketing and sale of surgical gowns by our former health care business.  We continue to produce documents and cooperate in this ongoing investigation.  At this stage, we are unable to predict an outcome or estimate the potential range of outcomes to resolve this matter.

Under the terms of the distribution agreement we entered into with Avanos in connection with the spin-off, Avanos is obligated to indemnify us for legal proceedings, claims and other liabilities primarily related to our former health care business.  Avanos and Kimberly-Clark have each filed suits against the other seeking declaratory judgment regarding the scope of these indemnification obligations.  We intend to vigorously pursue our case against Avanos and to vigorously defend their case against us.

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and are operating in compliance with, or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with, these laws and regulations.  We have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the U.S. federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of sites where hazardous substances are present.  None of our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

Objectives and Strategies for Using Derivatives

As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to financial risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.  We employ a number of practices to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where appropriate, the use of derivative instruments.

At

December 31, 2019

and


, derivative assets were

$


and

$


, respectively, and derivative liabilities were

$


and

$


, respectively, primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange contracts.  Derivative assets are recorded in Other current assets or Other Assets, as appropriate, and derivative liabilities are recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities or Other Liabilities, as appropriate.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Translation adjustments result from translating foreign entities' financial statements into U.S. dollars from their functional currencies.  The risk to any particular entity's net assets is reduced to the extent that the entity is financed with local currency borrowings.  A portion of our balance sheet translation exposure for certain affiliates, which results from changes in translation


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

rates between the affiliates’ functional currencies and the U.S. dollar, is hedged with cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt which are designated as net investment hedges. The foreign currency exposure on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany loans and accounts payable, is hedged with primarily undesignated derivative instruments.

Derivative instruments are entered into to hedge a portion of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies for non-U.S. operations' purchases of raw materials, which are priced in U.S. dollars, and imports of intercompany finished goods and work-in-process priced predominantly in U.S. dollars and euros.  The derivative instruments used to manage these exposures are designated as cash flow hedges.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is managed using a portfolio of variable and fixed-rate debt composed of short and long-term instruments.  Interest rate swap contracts may be used to facilitate the maintenance of the desired ratio of variable and fixed-rate debt and are designated as fair value hedges.  From time to time, we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt, and these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.

Commodity Price Risk

We use derivative instruments, such as forward contracts, to hedge a limited portion of our exposure to market risk arising from changes in prices of certain commodities.  These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of specific quantities of the underlying commodity expected to be purchased in future months.  In addition, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures, including fixed price contracts, to manage volatility for a portion of our commodity costs.

Fair Value Hedges

Derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are predominantly used to manage interest rate risk.  The fair values of these derivative instruments are recorded as an asset or liability, as appropriate, with the offset recorded in current Interest expense.  The offset to the change in fair values of the related debt is also recorded in Interest expense.  Any realized gain or loss on the derivatives that hedge interest rate risk is amortized to Interest expense over the life of the related debt.  As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional values and carrying values of outstanding interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges were

$


and

$


, respectively.  For each of the three years ended

December 31, 2019

, gains or losses recognized in Interest expense for interest rate swaps were not significant.

Cash Flow Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially recorded in AOCI, net of related income taxes, and recognized in earnings in the same income statement line and period that the hedged exposure affects earnings.  As of

December 31, 2019

, outstanding commodity forward contracts were in place to hedge a limited portion of our estimated requirements of the related underlying commodities in


and future periods.  As of

December 31, 2019

, the aggregate notional value of outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges was

$


.  For each of the three years ended December 31, 2019, no significant gains or losses were reclassified into Interest expense, Cost of products sold or Other (income) and expense, net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to the original forecasted transaction no longer being probable of occurring.  At

December 31, 2019

, amounts to be reclassified from AOCI into Interest expense, Cost of products sold or Other (income), net during the next twelve months are not expected to be material.  The maximum maturity of cash flow hedges in place at

December 31, 2019

is

December 2021

.

Net Investment Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the aggregate notional value was

$

1.5

billion

at

December 31, 2019

.  We exclude the interest accruals on cross-currency swap contracts and the forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness.  We recognize the interest accruals on cross-currency swap contracts in earnings within Interest expense.  We amortize the forward points on foreign exchange contracts into earnings within Interest expense over the life of the hedging relationship.  Changes in fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in AOCI and offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, no significant unrealized gains or losses related to net investment hedge fair value changes were recorded in AOCI and no significant amounts were reclassified from AOCI to Interest expense.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

No significant amounts were excluded from the assessment of net investment, fair value or cash flow hedge effectiveness as of December 31, 2019.

Undesignated Hedging Instruments

Gains or losses on undesignated foreign exchange hedging instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) and expense, net.  Losses of

$


and

$


, and a gain of

$


were recorded in the years ending

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.  The effect on earnings from the use of these non-designated derivatives is substantially neutralized by the transactional gains and losses recorded on the underlying assets and liabilities.  At

December 31, 2019

, the notional amount of these undesignated derivative instruments was approximately

$

1.9

Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  The Tax Act made changes to the U.S. tax code, which included (1) a reduced U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, (2) implementation of a base erosion and anti-abuse tax, (3) general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, (4) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") of foreign subsidiaries which allows for the possibility of utilizing foreign tax credits to offset the tax liability (subject to some limitations), (5) a lower effective U.S. tax rate on certain revenues from sources outside the U.S., and (6) a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  In the period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional discrete net tax benefit associated with the Tax Act and related matters. The provisional amounts recorded in 2017 related to the transition tax, remeasurement of deferred taxes, our reassessment of permanently reinvested earnings, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances, and actions taken in anticipation of the Tax Act were finalized and a net expense of

$


was recorded during 2018.

During 2018, we also recorded discrete net tax expense of

$


primarily related to new guidance issued during 2018 affecting tax benefits we recorded in the period ended December 31, 2017 for the transition tax and certain tax planning actions taken in anticipation of the Tax Act.

At December 31, 2018, we finalized our policy and have elected to use the period cost method for GILTI provisions and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse in future periods.

In December 2019, we generated a nonrecurring capital loss from a legal entity restructuring. We recorded a net benefit of $47 in the fourth quarter.  There is no capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset remaining after utilization for 2019 capital gains.

An analysis of the provision for income taxes follows:


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

Income before income taxes is earned in the following tax jurisdictions:

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are composed of the following:

Valuation allowances at the end of


primarily relate to tax credits, capital loss carryforwards, and income tax loss carryforwards of

$


.  If these items are not utilized against taxable income,

$


of the income tax loss carryforwards will expire from


through


.  The remaining

$


has no expiration date.

Realization of income tax loss carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of these carryforwards.  Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets, net of applicable valuation allowances, will be realized.  The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced or increased due to changes in the tax environment or if estimates of future taxable income change during the carryforward period.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

Presented below is a reconciliation of the income tax provision computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the actual effective tax rate:

(a)

Other - net is composed of numerous items, none of which is greater than 1.05 percent and 1.75 percent of income before income taxes in 2019-2018 and  2017, respectively.

As of December 31, 2019, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately

$

7.7

billion

.  Earnings of

$

5.6

billion

were previously subject to tax, primarily due to the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings required by the Tax Act.  Any additional taxes due with respect to such previously-taxed earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to foreign and U.S. state income taxes.  Deferred taxes have been recorded on

$

0.9

billion

of earnings, most of which were previously taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated.  We do not intend to distribute the remaining

$

4.7

billion

of previously-taxed foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and U.S. state income taxes on such earnings.

Prior to the transition tax, we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries.  While the transition tax resulted in a reduction of the excess amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, any remaining amount of financial reporting over tax basis after such reduction could be subject to additional taxes, if repatriated.  However, we consider any excess to be indefinitely reinvested.  The determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the

$

4.7

billion

of previously taxed foreign earnings is not practicable.

Presented below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized income tax benefits:

The Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil ("RFB"), concluded an audit for the taxable periods from 2008-2013. This audit included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from prior acquisitions  in Brazil, and the RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to these transactions.  Administrative appeals have been exhausted, and the dispute is moving into the judicial phase.  The amount of the proposed tax adjustments and penalties is approximately

as of December 31, 2019 (translated at the December 31, 2019 currency exchange rate).  The amount ultimately in dispute will be significantly greater because of interest.  We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend these proposed adjustments; however, it is expected to take a number of years to reach resolution of this matter.

Business Segment Information

We are organized into operating segments based on product groupings.  These operating segments have been aggregated into three reportable global business segments: Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and KCP.  The reportable segments were determined in accordance with how our chief operating decision maker and our executive managers develop and execute global strategies to drive growth and profitability.  These strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology, research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management, and capacity and capital investments for each of these businesses.  Segment management is evaluated on several factors, including operating profit.  Segment operating profit excludes Other (income) and expense, net and income and expense not associated with ongoing operations of the business segments, including the costs of corporate decisions related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program described in

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of

Kimberly-Clark Corporation:

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kimberly-Clark Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Corporation") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Table of Contents at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Corporation utilizes various trade promotional programs globally. The cost of promotion activities is classified as a reduction in sales revenue and can result in a period of time between the date the customer earns a promotion and the date the customer claims the promotion. The Corporation records an accrual for estimated promotions using customer sales associated with valid promotion events, actual promotional claims, and forecasted information of amounts earned by the customer but not yet claimed. As of December 31, 2019, the accrual balance was approximately $380 million.


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

We identified trade promotions and the related accrual as a critical audit matter because of the complexity and volume of the Corporation’s processes related to trade promotion programs and the subjectivity of estimating future customer claims.  This required an extensive audit effort due to the complexity and volume of the trade promotional programs and information systems utilized globally as well as the subjectivity of estimating future customer claims related to the trade promotion accrual.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the reduction in revenue associated with trade promotions and the trade promotion accrual included the following, among others:

▪

With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:

- Identified the significant systems used to process trade promotion transactions and tested the general IT controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management controls, and IT operations controls

- Tested the effectiveness of automated controls over revenue streams, including those over the evaluation of the accuracy and completeness of trade promotions

▪

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the trade promotion claims and accrual, including those over the quantity of customer sales associated with valid promotional events and the estimated future promotional claims associated with the trade accrual.

▪

We evaluated gross sales using either analytical procedures or by evaluating individual promotional transactions. When analytical procedures were performed, we predicted gross sales based on the relationship with either cost of products sold or sales volume and average sales price per unit adjusted for changes in data such as changes in product mix, sales margin, or inflation. When individual promotional transactions were evaluated, we obtained evidence of the promotional agreement with the customer and the amounts of the promotions earned.

▪

We evaluated management’s ability to estimate future promotional claims by comparing actual promotional claims to management’s historical estimate.

▪

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of future promotional claims by testing the underlying data related to (1) customer sales associated with valid promotional events, (2) actual promotional claims, and (3) forecasted information.

We have served as the Corporation’s auditor since 1928.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of

December 31, 2019

, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)).  Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.  This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and our Board of Directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and safeguarding of our assets.  This system is supported with written policies and procedures, contains self-monitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function.  Appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified.  All internal control systems have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and, therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial statement preparation and such asset safeguarding.

We have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

.  In making this assessment, we used the criteria described in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of

December 31, 2019

, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, and has expressed an unqualified opinion in their report, which appears in this report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above in "Internal Control Over Financial Reporting" that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of

Kimberly-Clark Corporation:

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Kimberly-Clark Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, of the Corporation and our report dated February 13, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion


KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION

- 2019 Annual Report

The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A corporation’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
