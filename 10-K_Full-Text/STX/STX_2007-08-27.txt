PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

We are the leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of
    rigid disc drives. Rigid disc drives, which are commonly
    referred to as disc drives or hard drives, are used as the
    primary medium for storing electronic information in systems
    ranging from desktop and notebook computers, and consumer
    electronics devices to data centers delivering information over
    corporate networks and the Internet. We produce a broad range of
    disc drive products addressing enterprise applications, where
    our products are used in enterprise servers, mainframes and
    workstations; desktop applications, where our products are used
    in desktop computers; mobile computing applications, where our
    products are used in notebook computers; and consumer
    electronics applications, where our products are used in a wide
    variety of devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs),
    gaming devices and other consumer electronic devices that
    require storage. We also sell storage products containing our
    disc drives under the Seagate Technology (“Seagate”)
    and Maxtor Corporation (“Maxtor”) brands.

We sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment
    manufacturers (OEMs) and also market to distributors under our
    globally recognized brand names. For the fiscal years 2007, 2006
    and 2005, approximately 64%, 72% and 72%, respectively, of our
    disc drive revenue was from sales to OEMs, of which
    Hewlett-Packard (“HP”) was the only customer exceeding
    10% of our disc drive revenue in all of these respective periods
    while Dell exceeded 10% of our disc drive revenue for fiscal
    years 2006 and 2005. We have longstanding relationships with
    many of our OEM customers. We also have key relationships with
    major distributors who sell our disc drive products to small
    OEMs, dealers, system integrators and retailers throughout most
    of the world. Shipments to distributors were approximately 30%,
    25% and 26% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Retail sales of our branded storage
    products in fiscal year 2007, as a percentage of our disc drive
    revenue, was 6%, compared to 3% and 2% in fiscal years 2006 and
    2005, respectively. For fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    approximately 30%, 30% and 31%, respectively, of our disc drive
    revenue came from customers located in North America,
    approximately 27%, 27% and 28%, respectively, came from
    customers located in Europe and approximately 43%, 43% and 41%,
    respectively, came from customers located in the Far East.
    Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in
    U.S. dollars.

In addition to manufacturing and selling disc drives and branded
    storage products, we provide data storage services for small to
    medium size businesses, including online backup, data protection
    and recovery solutions through EVault, Inc.
    (“EVault”), which we acquired in fiscal year 2007.

Demand
    for Electronic Data Storage

We believe that the amount of data stored and accessed
    electronically is growing rapidly. We believe the key factor
    driving this demand is the mass proliferation of digital
    content. While the electronic data storage industry has
    traditionally been focused on compute applications for the
    enterprise and corporate markets, a continued proliferation of
    non-compute applications in the consumer electronics market is
    increasingly driving the broad, global expansion of the demand
    for electronic data storage driven by:

•

the

creation

of all types of digital content such as
    digital photos, video, movies and music by consumers, as well as
    devices for enjoyment, consumption and preservation of such
    content such as DVRs, digital music players, handheld
    applications, gaming consoles and storage devices in automobiles;

•

the

aggregation and distribution

of digital content
    through services and other offerings by companies such as
    YouTube by Google Inc. (“Google”), Flickr by Yahoo!
    Inc. (“Yahoo”), iTunes by Apple and MySpace by News
    Corporation (“News Corp.”).

We believe that because digital content is increasingly rich in
    media with the mass utilization of photos, video, movies and
    music, the related storage applications and solutions
    increasingly require higher storage capacity to store, manage,
    distribute, utilize and back up richer media digital content.
    This in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for
    electronic data storage hardware solutions that either directly
    utilize disc drives, or indirectly drive the demand for
    additional disc drive storage to store, host or back up related
    electronic data content.



Additionally, we believe that demand for electronic data storage
    in the enterprise and traditional compute markets have also
    increased as increasing legal and regulatory requirements and
    changes in the nature and amount of data being stored has
    necessitated additional storage.

Demand
    for Disc Drives

Disc drives store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating
    platters with magnetic surfaces. Disc drives provide reliable,
    large capacity data storage, and are characterized by relatively
    low-cost per gigabyte of storage. Disc drives are presently the
    most common storage solution in enterprise, desktop, mobile and
    higher capacity consumer electronics applications.

Disc Drives for Enterprise Storage.

The need
    to address the expansion in data storage management requirements
    has increased the demand for new hardware storage solutions for
    both mission critical and business critical enterprise storage.

Many enterprises are moving away from the use of server-attached
    storage to network-attached storage for mission critical
    enterprise storage. We expect the market for these solutions
    will likely grow, resulting in greater opportunities for the
    sale of high-performance, high capacity disc drives. Many
    enterprises are also consolidating data centers, aiming to
    increase speed and reliability within a smaller space, reduce
    network complexity and increase savings associated with hardware
    costs and maintenance. This has led to an increased demand for
    more energy efficient, smaller form factor disc drives.
    Recently, solid state drives (SSDs) storage applications that
    use flash storage technology as an alternative to disc drive
    storage technology, have been introduced as a potential
    alternative to redundant system startup or boot disc drives.

In addition to the growth in mission critical enterprise
    storage, there has also been significant growth in the use of
    high capacity, enterprise class serial advanced technology
    architecture (SATA) products in business critical storage
    systems used by enterprises to store and access
    capacity-intensive non-critical data. This application is
    exemplified by growth in content aggregation and distribution by
    companies like Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and News Corp as well as
    storage service providers. We believe that this growth in demand
    for disc drives for use in business critical storage systems is
    likely to shift some demand from disc drives used in traditional
    mission critical enterprise storage in the longer term.

Disc Drives for Mobile Computing.

The mobile
    computing market is expected to grow faster than that for
    desktop computers as price and performance continue to improve.
    Notebooks are increasingly replacing desktop computers and are
    progressively more desirable to consumers as the need for
    mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance.
    We estimate that in fiscal year 2007, industry shipments of disc
    drives for mobile compute applications grew approximately 35%
    from fiscal year 2006.

The disc drive industry has recently introduced hybrid disc
    drives for mobile compute applications that add flash memory to
    a disc drive to provide customers with a single, integrated
    solution with enhanced performance, better power utilization,
    quicker

start-up

speed and prolonged disc drive durability. Certain companies
    have also recently introduced SSDs for mobile compute
    applications that directly compete with mobile disc drives. The
    current cost per gigabyte for SSDs is significantly higher than
    the cost per gigabyte for disc drives and is projected to remain
    higher for the foreseeable future, which we believe will largely
    inhibit the use of SSDs in many price-sensitive mass-market
    mobile compute applications.

Disc Drives for Desktop Computing.

We believe
    growth in disc drives for desktop computing has recently
    moderated, in part due to the shift from desktop computers to
    notebook computers, particularly in developed countries. We
    believe that current growth in demand for disc drives in desktop
    computing is concentrated in developing markets where price
    remains a primary consideration in compute application data
    storage purchases.

Disc Drives for Consumer Electronics.

Disc
    drives in the consumer electronics markets are primarily used in
    DVRs and gaming consoles which require more storage capability
    than can be provided in a cost-effective manner through
    alternative technologies such as flash memory, which are better
    suited to lower capacity consumer electronics applications. We
    believe the demand for disc drives in consumer electronics will
    become more pronounced with the increased amount of high
    definition content that requires larger amounts of storage
    capacity. With respect to handheld applications, we believe disc
    drive products smaller than 1.8-inch form factors have to a



large extent been replaced by competing storage technologies,
    such as solid state or flash memory. However, we believe that
    disc drives continue to be well suited in applications requiring
    capacities of 20 gigabytes (GB) or more, and that the demand for
    disc drives as additional storage to store, hold or back up
    related media content from such handheld devices, continues to
    grow.

Disc Drives for Branded Solutions.

We believe
    that industry demand for storage products like our branded
    storage products is increasing due to the proliferation of
    media-rich digital content in consumer applications and is
    fuelling increased consumer demand for storage. This has led to
    the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to
    provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case
    of disaster or system failure, or to provide independent storage
    solutions for multiple users in home or small business
    environments.

Success
    in the Disc Drive Industry Depends on Technology and
    Manufacturing Leadership, High Levels of Capital and Research
    and Development Investments and Large Scale

The design and manufacturing of disc drives depends on highly
    advanced technology and manufacturing techniques, especially in
    the areas of read/write heads and recording media, thereby
    requiring high levels of capital and research and development
    investments. We believe the competitive dynamics of the disc
    drive industry favor integrated manufacturers such as ourselves,
    with the large scale and resources to make substantial
    technology investments and apply them across a broad product
    portfolio and a wide variety of customers.

Integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce
    the critical components, including read/write heads and
    recording media, used in their disc drives. An integrated
    approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to
    improve the functionality of components so that they work
    together efficiently. Due to the significant challenges posed by
    the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing
    efficiency and because of the increasing amounts of capital and
    research and development investments required, the disc drive
    industry has undergone significant consolidation as disc drive
    manufacturers and component suppliers merged with other
    companies or exited the industry. Through such combinations,
    disc drive manufacturers have also become increasingly
    vertically integrated. For instance, Maxtor acquired Quantum in
    April 2001. Then, International Business Machines Corporation
    (“IBM”) merged its rigid disc drive business with that
    of Hitachi through the formation of Hitachi Global Storage
    Technologies in December 2002. This trend of disc drive
    manufacturer consolidation continued with our acquisition of
    Maxtor in May 2006. In March 2007, TDK, a disc drive head
    manufacturer, announced its pending acquisition of Alps, also a
    disc drive head manufacturer, while in June 2007, Western
    Digital announced that it is acquiring Komag. We believe
    consolidation is likely to continue in the disc drive industry
    through combination of disc drive manufacturers, component
    manufacturers, or both, as the technological challenges and the
    associated levels of required investment grow, increasing the
    competitive necessity of larger-scale operations.

Disc
    Drive Technology

Overview

All disc drives incorporate the same basic technology although
    individual products vary. One or more discs are attached to a
    spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the
    discs at a high constant speed around a hub. The discs, or
    recording media, are the components on which data is stored and
    from which it is retrieved. Each disc typically consists of a
    substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a
    thin-film magnetic material. Read/write heads, mounted on an arm
    assembly similar in concept to that of a record player, fly
    extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and
    retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the
    rotating discs. The read/write heads are mounted vertically on
    an

E-shaped

assembly. The

E-block

and
    the recording media are mounted inside a metal casing, called
    the base casing.

Upon instructions from the drive’s electronic circuitry, a
    head positioning mechanism, or actuator, guides the heads to the
    selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or
    retrieved. Application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and
    ancillary electronic control chips are collectively mounted on
    printed circuit boards. ASICs move data to and from the
    read/write head and the internal controller, or interface, which
    communicates with the host computer. Disc drive manufacturers
    typically use one or more of several industry standard
    interfaces such as



advanced technology architecture (ATA); SATA, which provides
    higher data transfer rates than the previous ATA standard; small
    computer system interface (SCSI); serial attached SCSI (SAS);
    and Fibre Channel.

Disc
    Drive Performance

Disc drive performance is commonly assessed by six key
    characteristics:

•

storage capacity, commonly expressed in GB or terabytes (TB),
    which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disc;

•

spindle rotation speed, commonly expressed in revolutions per
    minute (RPM), which has an effect on speed of access to data;

•

interface transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per
    second, which is the rate at which data moves between the disc
    drive and the computer controller;

•

average seek time, commonly expressed in milliseconds, which is
    the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on
    the disc surface,

•

data transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second,
    which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the
    disc; and

•

product quality and reliability, commonly expressed in
    annualized return rates (ARR).

Areal
    Density

Areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch
    on the recording surface of a disc. Current areal densities are
    sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today.
    We expect the long-term demand for increased drive capacities
    will continue to grow proportionately with the shift in storage
    applications from predominantly compute applications to more
    high-resolution media content. In particular, audio, video and
    image storage data continue to increase in size, with high
    definition video content an example of data requiring many
    multiples of the storage capacity of standard video. Demand will
    further intensify by the proliferation of these forms of
    content. We have pursued, and expect to continue to pursue, a
    number of technologies to increase areal densities across the
    entire range of our products to increase disc drive capacities
    and to enable the production of higher capacity, smaller form
    factor disc drives. We led the industry in transitioning from
    longitudinal to perpendicular recording technology, in which
    data bits are oriented vertically on the disc platter
    (perpendicular to the disc surface), rather than flat to the
    surface in order to increase areal density and capacity.

Manufacturing

We pursue an integrated business strategy based on the ownership
    of critical component technologies. This vertical integration
    strategy allows us to maintain control over our product roadmap
    and component cost, quality and availability. Our manufacturing
    efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our
    integrated business strategy. We continuously seek to improve
    our manufacturing efficiency and cost by:

•

consolidating the number and location of facilities we operate
    and reducing the number of personnel we employ;

•

employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency and
    flexibility;

•

applying Six Sigma to improve product quality and reliability
    and reduce costs;

•

integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to
    enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital
    requirements; and

•

coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research
    and development organization to rapidly achieve volume
    manufacturing and enhance our product quality and reliability.

Manufacturing our disc drives is a complex process that begins
    with the production of individual components and ends with a
    fully assembled unit. We design, fabricate

and/or

assemble a number of the most important



components found in our disc drives, including read/write heads,
    recording media and printed circuit boards. Our design and
    manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that
    are used to produce various disc drive products that serve
    multiple disc drive applications and markets. As an example, our
    3.5-inch ATA disc drive with perpendicular recording technology
    platform is sold to customers for use in desktop, enterprise and
    consumer electronics applications. Our main technology platforms
    are primarily focused around areal density of media and
    read/write head technologies. In addition, we also invest in
    certain other technology platforms including motors, servo
    formatting read/write channels, solid-state technologies and
    sealed drive technologies. Our integrated platform technologies
    and manufacturing allow our set of products to be used in a wide
    range of electronic data storage applications and in a wide
    range of industries.

We believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing
    strategy, we are well suited to meet the challenges posed by the
    close interdependence of components for disc drives, which is
    especially critical in the design and production of products
    incorporating perpendicular recording technology.

Read/Write Heads.

The function of the
    read/write head is to scan across the disc as it spins,
    magnetically recording or reading information. The tolerances of
    recording heads are extremely demanding and require
    state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our read/write heads
    are manufactured with thin-film and photolithographic processes
    similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated
    circuits, though challenges in magnetic film properties and
    topographical structures are unique to the disc drive industry.
    Beginning with six and eight-inch round ceramic wafers, we
    process more than 30,000 head elements at one time. Each of
    these head elements goes through more than 500 steps, all in
    clean room environments. As we expect to essentially complete
    our product transition to perpendicular recording technology by
    the end of calendar year 2008, we have upgraded our fabrication
    facilities in capital equipment and systems to deliver the
    required complexity and precision. Additional capital
    investments will be driven primarily by volume. We perform all
    primary stages of design and manufacture of read/write heads at
    our facilities. We currently manufacture virtually all of our
    read/write heads.

Recording Media.

The function of the recording
    media is to magnetically store information. The domains where
    each bit of magnetic code is stored are extremely small and
    precisely placed. As a result, the manufacturing of recording
    media requires sophisticated thin-film processes. Each disc is a
    sequentially processed set of sputtered layers that consist of
    structural, magnetic, protective and lubricating materials
    deposited on a disc substrate. Once complete, the disc must have
    a high degree of physical uniformity to assure reliable and
    error-free storage. Recording media is deposited on aluminum or
    glass substrates.

The percentage of our requirements for recording media that we
    produce internally varies from quarter to quarter. We are
    continuing to expand our media production facilities in
    Singapore, and have relocated certain of the acquired Maxtor
    media manufacturing equipment to Asia. We do not expect our new
    media facility in Singapore to be fully operational until
    towards the end of fiscal year 2008. Our long-term strategy is
    to externally purchase no more than 15% of total recording media
    requirements.

We purchase approximately 70% of our aluminum substrates for
    recording media production from third parties. We are in the
    process of adding an aluminum substrate manufacturing facility
    in Johor, Malaysia which will allow us to decrease our purchases
    of aluminum substrates from third parties. We also purchase all
    of our glass substrates from third parties (mainly in Japan),
    which are used in manufacturing our disc drives for mobile and
    small form factor consumer electronics products.

Recently, substantially all of our purchases of recording media
    and a significant portion of our aluminum substrates from
    third-party suppliers have been sourced from Komag, which is in
    the process of being acquired by Western Digital. We are engaged
    in discussions with all our suppliers to ensure supply
    continuity. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our
    Business — Dependence on Supply of Components,
    Equipment, and Raw Materials — If we experience
    shortages or delays in the receipt of critical components,
    equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our
    products, we may suffer lower operating margins, production
    delays and other material adverse effects.”

Raw Materials.

Perpendicular recording
    technology requires recording media with more layers and the use
    of more precious metals and scarce alloys in the sputtering
    process required to create such layers. As a result, products
    utilizing perpendicular recording technology are more sensitive
    to fluctuations in prices and availability of



precious metals and scarce alloys such as platinum and
    ruthenium. As our product offerings have transitioned to
    perpendicular recording technology, we have increased inventory
    of these precious metals and scarce alloys and may continue to
    be required to increase inventory over time.

Printed Circuit Boards.

We assemble and test a
    significant portion of the printed circuit boards used in our
    disc drives. Printed circuit boards are the boards that contain
    the electronic circuitry and ASICs that provide the electronic
    controls of the disc drive and on which the head-disc assembly
    is mounted. We assemble printed circuit boards at our facilities
    in Malaysia and China.

Spindle Motors.

We participate in the design
    of many of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from
    outside vendors in Asia, whom we have licensed to use our
    intellectual property and technology.

ASICs.

We participate in the design of many of
    the ASICs used in our disc drives for motor and actuator
    control, such as interface controllers, read/write channels and

pre-amplifiers.

We do not manufacture any ASICs but, rather, buy them from
    third-party suppliers.

Disc Drive Assembly.

Following the production
    of the individual components of the disc drive, the first step
    in the manufacture of a disc drive itself is the assembly of the
    actuator arm, read/write heads, discs and spindle motor in a
    housing to form the head-disc assembly. The production of the
    head-disc assembly involves largely automated processes. Printed
    circuit boards are then mated to the head-disc assembly and the
    completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment. Disc
    drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities
    located in China, Singapore and Thailand. We perform subassembly
    and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in
    China, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Thailand, and in
    the United States, in California and Minnesota. In addition,
    third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in
    various Asian countries, including China, Japan, Korea,
    Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
    Vietnam, in Europe and the United States.

Customers

We sell our disc drive products primarily to major OEMs and
    distributors. OEM customers incorporate our disc drives into
    computer systems and storage systems for resale. Distributors
    typically sell our disc drives to small OEMs, dealers, system
    integrators and other resellers. Shipments to OEMs were
    approximately 64%, 72% and 72% of our disc drive revenue in
    fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Shipments to
    distributors were approximately 30%, 25% and 26% of our disc
    drive revenue in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Sales to HP accounted for approximately 16%, 17% and 18% of our
    disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, while sales to Dell, as a percentage of our disc
    drive revenue, were 9%, 11% and 12% in fiscal years 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or
    more of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
    2005. Retail sales of our branded storage products in fiscal
    year 2007 as a percentage of our disc drive revenue increased to
    6% from 3% and 2% in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    See “Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our
    Business — Dependence on Key Customers — We
    may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced, delayed or
    cancelled purchases by, one or more of our larger
    customers.”

OEM customers typically enter into master purchase agreements
    with us. These agreements provide for pricing, volume discounts,
    order lead times, product support obligations and other terms
    and conditions. The term of these agreements is usually 12 to
    36 months, although our product support obligations
    generally extend substantially beyond this period. These master
    agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any
    minimum quantity of products, or create exclusive relationships.
    Deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders.
    In addition, with limited lead-time, customers may cancel or
    defer most purchase orders without significant penalty.
    Anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past
    failed to materialize or OEM delivery schedules have been
    deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business
    needs.

Our distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements
    for the redistribution of our products. They typically furnish
    us with a non-binding indication of their near-term requirements
    and product deliveries are generally scheduled based on a weekly
    confirmation by the distributor of its requirements for that
    week. The agreements typically provide the distributors with
    price protection with respect to their inventory of our disc
    drives at the time of a reduction by us in our selling price for
    the disc drives and also provide limited rights to return the
    product.

We have significantly increased our sales of branded storage
    products to retail customers in the last two years with the
    Maxtor acquisition further expanding our retail customer base.
    Retail sales typically require higher marketing support, sales
    incentives and longer price protection periods.

We also regularly enter into agreements with our customers,
    which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses
    resulting from intellectual property claims. These agreements
    are customary in our industry and typically require us to
    indemnify our customer against certain damages and costs
    incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims
    arising as a result of their use of our products.

Sales,
    Marketing and Customer Service

Our marketing organization works to increase demand for our disc
    drive products through strategic collaboration with key OEM
    customers and distribution partners to align our respective
    product roadmaps and to build our brand and end-customer
    relationships. As customer and markets increasingly demand a
    broad variety of products with different performance and cost
    attributes, we have recently organized our marketing
    organization with groups focused on the strategic needs of our
    increasingly diverse customer base. We believe this enables us
    to serve both our core markets and better identify, develop and
    serve emerging markets.

Our sales organization focuses on deepening our relationship
    with our customers. The worldwide sales group focuses on
    geographic coverage of OEMs and distributors throughout most of
    the world. The worldwide sales group is organized by customer
    type and regionally among North America, Japan, Asia-Pacific
    (excluding Japan) and



Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In addition, we have a sales
    operation group which focuses on aligning our production levels
    with customers’ product requirements. Our sales force works
    directly with our marketing organization to coordinate our OEM
    and distribution channel relationships. We maintain sales
    offices throughout the United States and in Australia, China,
    France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

With the acquisition of Maxtor, we acquired the right to the use
    the Maxtor and other related brand names. We believe the Maxtor
    brand is a valuable asset, and we intend to continue to offer
    the Maxtor brand of products to consumers globally to broaden
    our reach into and coverage of these channels as well as
    optimize the impact of our marketing investments.

Our customer service organization maintains a global network of
    service points to process warranty returns and manage outsourced
    repair vendors. We generally warrant our products for periods
    ranging from one year to five years.

Foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other
    restrictions, including, in the case of some countries, approval
    by the Office of Export Administration of the
    U.S. Department of Commerce and other
    U.S. governmental agencies.

Competition

The markets that we compete in are intensely competitive, with
    disc drive manufacturers not only competing for a limited number
    of major disc drive customers, but also increasingly competing
    with other companies in the electronic data storage industry
    that provide alternative storage solutions, such as flash memory
    and SSDs. Some of the principal factors used by customers to
    differentiate among electronic data storage solutions
    manufacturers are storage capacity; price per unit and price per
    gigabyte; storage/retrieval access times; data transfer rates;
    product quality and reliability; production volume capability;
    form factor; responsiveness to customer preferences and demands;
    warranty; and brand.

We believe that our disc drive products are competitive with
    respect to each of these factors in the markets that we
    currently address. We summarize below our principal disc drive
    competitors, other competitors, the effect of competition on
    price erosion for our products and product life cycles and
    technology.

Principal Disc Drive Competitors.

We have
    experienced and expect to continue to experience intense
    competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies,
    some of which have greater financial and other resources than we
    have. These competitors include independent disc drive
    manufacturers such as Western Digital, as well as large captive
    manufacturers such as Fujitsu, Samsung, Hitachi, and Toshiba.
    Because they produce complete computer systems and other
    non-compute consumer electronics and mobile devices, these
    “captive manufacturers” can derive a greater portion
    of their operating margins from other components, which reduces
    their need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in
    their computer systems and allows them to sell disc drives to
    third parties at very low margins. Many captive manufacturers
    are also formidable competitors because they have more
    substantial resources and greater access to their internal
    customers than we do. In addition, Hitachi (together with
    affiliated entities), Toshiba and Samsung, each are increasingly
    integrating other storage technologies such as flash memory,
    hybrid disc drives and SSDs into its product offerings. Not only
    may they be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin
    to advance their overall business strategy, their portfolio
    allows them to be indifferent to which technology prevails over
    the other. They can offer a broad range of storage media and
    solutions and focus on those with lowest costs and greatest
    sales. In connection with our branded storage products, in
    addition to competing with our disc drive competitors, we also
    compete with companies such as LaCie S.A. that purchase
    disc drives for use in their branded storage products from us
    and our competitors.

Other Competitors.

We also are experiencing
    competition from companies that provide alternative storage
    technologies such as flash memory, which have substantially
    replaced disc drives in lower capacity handheld devices.
    Principal competitors include Samsung, Hitachi, Micron and
    SanDisk.



Price Erosion.

Our industry has been
    characterized by continuous price erosion for disc drive
    products with comparable capacity, performance and feature sets
    (i.e., “like-for-like products”). Price erosion for
    like-for-like products is more pronounced during periods of:

•

industry consolidation in which competitors aggressively use
    discounted price to gain market share;

•

few newer product introductions when multiple competitors have
    comparable product offerings;

•

temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand; and

•

seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply.

Disc drive manufacturers typically attempt to off-set price
    erosion with an improved mix of disc drive products
    characterized by higher capacity, better performance and
    additional feature sets

and/or

product cost reductions.

We expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for
    the foreseeable future. To remain competitive, it will be
    necessary to continue to reduce our prices, as well as introduce
    new product offerings with increased disc drive capacities

and/or

improved feature sets, utilizing advanced technologies prior to
    our competitors to take advantage of potentially higher initial
    profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products.
    We have established production facilities in China, Malaysia,
    Singapore and Thailand to achieve cost reductions.

Product Life Cycles and Changing
    Technology.

Historically, competition and
    changing customer preference and demand in the electronic data
    storage industry have shortened product life cycles and caused
    acceleration in the development and introduction of new
    technology. We believe that our future success will depend upon
    our ability to develop, manufacture and market products of high
    quality and reliability which meet changing user needs and which
    successfully anticipate or respond to changes in technology and
    standards on a cost-effective and timely basis. Introduction of
    any technology that delivers storage at an attractive price, or
    has other features not available to disc drives, will be
    disruptive to the disc drive industry. Product life cycles are
    also being shortened with the increasing capabilities of flash
    and SSD. For example, our

1-inch

disc
    drive’s life cycle was shortened when it was replaced by
    flash memory in smaller capacity handheld consumer electronics
    applications.

Seasonality

The disc drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal
    variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second
    half of the calendar year. This seasonality is driven by
    consumer spending in the back-to-school season from late summer
    to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to
    winter. In addition, corporate demand is higher during the
    second half of the calendar year when IT budget calendars
    typically provide for more spending.

Research
    and Development

We are committed to developing new component technologies and
    products and evaluating alternative storage technologies,
    including flash storage technology. We have increased our focus
    on research and development and realigned our disc drive
    development process. This structured product process is designed
    to bring new products to market in a high volume environment and
    with quality attributes that our customers expect. Our research
    group, which is based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is dedicated
    to the transition and extending the capacity of perpendicular
    recording technology as well as exploring alternative data
    storage technologies. Our advanced technology integration effort
    focuses disc drive and component research on recording
    subsystems, including read/write heads and recording media,
    market-specific product technology as well as technology focused
    towards new business opportunities. The primary purpose of our
    advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely
    availability of mature component technologies to our product
    development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and
    coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our
    products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the
    marketplace. During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we had
    product development expenses of $904 million,
    $805 million and $645 million, respectively, which
    represented 8%, 9% and 9% of our consolidated revenue,
    respectively.



Patents
    and Licenses

As of June 29, 2007, we had approximately 3,857
    U.S. patents and 761 patents issued in various foreign
    jurisdictions as well as approximately 1,287 U.S. and 651
    foreign patent applications pending. The number of patents and
    patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our
    ongoing patent portfolio management activity. Due to the rapid
    technological change that characterizes the information storage
    industry, we believe that the improvement of existing products,
    reliance upon trade secret law, the protection of unpatented
    proprietary know-how and development of new products are
    generally more important than patent protection in establishing
    and maintaining a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, we
    believe that patents are valuable to our business and intend to
    continue our efforts to obtain patents, where available, in
    connection with our research and development program.

The information storage industry is characterized by significant
    litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property
    rights. Because of rapid technological development in the
    information storage industry, some of our products have been,
    and in the future could be, alleged to infringe existing patents
    of third parties. From time to time, we receive claims that our
    products infringe patents of third parties. Although we have
    been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by
    obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question
    without a material adverse affect on us, other claims have
    resulted in adverse decisions or settlements. In addition, other
    claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could
    have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations. For more information on these claims, see
    “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” The costs of
    engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have
    been and may be substantial regardless of the merit of the claim
    or the outcome. We have patent cross-licenses with a number of
    companies. Additionally, as part of our normal intellectual
    property practices, we are engaged in negotiations with other
    major disc drive companies and component manufacturers with
    respect to ongoing patent cross-licenses.

Backlog

In view of customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with
    little or no penalty, we believe backlog in the disc drive
    industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future
    performance and results.

Employees

At June 29, 2007, we employed approximately
    54,000 employees, temporary employees and contractors
    worldwide, of which approximately 43,000 employees were
    located in our Asian operations. We believe that our future
    success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain
    qualified employees at all levels. We believe that our employee
    relations are good.

Environmental
    Matters

Our operations are subject to comprehensive U.S. and
    foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants
    into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous
    substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
    Some of our operations require environmental permits and
    controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and
    these permits are subject to modification, renewal and
    revocation by issuing authorities.

We believe that our operations are currently in substantial
    compliance with all environmental laws, regulations and permits.
    We incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to
    comply with environmental laws. If additional or more stringent
    requirements are imposed on us in the future, we could incur
    additional operating costs and capital expenditures.

Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal superfund
    law and similar state statutes, can impose liability for the
    cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or
    former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste
    to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator
    owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous
    substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity.
    We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at
    several superfund sites. At each of these sites, the government
    has assigned to us a



portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount
    of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site
    and the number of financially viable parties.

Some of our current and former sites have a history of
    commercial and industrial operations, including the use of
    hazardous substances. Groundwater and soil contamination
    resulting from historical operations has been identified at
    several of our current and former facilities and we are
    addressing the cleanup of these sites in cooperation with the
    relevant government agencies.

While our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is
    difficult to predict with complete accuracy, based on our
    current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation
    of these costs, we do not expect costs in connection with these
    superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material.

We may be subject to various state, federal and international
    laws and regulations governing the environment, including those
    restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic
    products. For example, the European Union (“EU”) has
    enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous
    Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment
    (“RoHS”), which prohibits the use of certain
    substances, including lead, in certain products, including hard
    drives, put on the market after July 1, 2006 as well as the
    Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”)
    directive, which makes producers of electrical goods, including
    disc drives, financially responsible for specified collection,
    recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered
    products. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in
    other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada,
    Mexico, China and Japan. We will need to ensure that we comply
    with such laws and regulations as they are enacted, and that our
    component suppliers also timely comply with such laws and
    regulations. If we fail to timely comply with the legislation,
    our customers may refuse to purchase our products, which would
    have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Risks
    Related to Our Business

Competition —
    Our industry is highly competitive and our products have
    experienced and will continue to experience significant price
    erosion and market share variability.

Even during periods when demand is stable, the disc drive
    industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically
    experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product.
    Our competitors have historically offered existing products at
    lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market
    share and customers, and we expect these practices to continue.
    We will need to continually reduce our prices to retain our
    market share, which could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

We believe this basic industry condition of continuing price
    erosion and market share variability will continue, as our
    competitors engage in aggressive pricing actions targeted to
    encourage shifting of customer demand. As a result, the pricing
    environment in 2007 continued to be very competitive, especially
    in the March and June 2007 quarters in the mobile compute market
    and the market for high capacity 3.5-inch ATA disc drives, and
    we expect pricing to remain competitive for the remainder of
    fiscal year 2008 as our competitors continue these efforts.

To the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue,
    product life cycles may lengthen, our competitors may have more
    time to enter the market for a particular product and we may be
    unable to offset these factors with new product introductions at
    higher average prices. A second general industry trend that may
    contribute to increased average price erosion is the growth of
    sales to distributors that serve producers of non-branded
    products in the personal storage sector. These customers
    generally have limited product qualification programs, which
    increases the number of competing products available to satisfy
    their demand. As a result, purchasing decisions for these
    customers are based largely on price and terms. Any increase in
    our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our
    result of operations.

Additionally, a significant portion of our success in the past
    has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense
    of our competitors, particularly in the notebook and small form
    factor enterprise markets. Our market share for our products can
    be negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their
    sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for
    particular products. When our competitors successfully introduce
    product offerings, which are competitive with our recently
    introduced new products, our customers may quickly diversify
    their sources of supply. Any significant decline in our market
    share would adversely affect our results of operations.

Principal
    Competitors — We compete with both independent
    manufacturers, whose primary focus is producing technologically
    advanced disc drives, and captive manufacturers, who do not
    depend solely on sales of disc drives to maintain their
    profitability.

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense
    competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies,
    including other independent disc drive manufacturers and large
    captive manufacturers such as:

Independent

Captive

Western Digital Corporation

Fujitsu Limited

GS Magicstor Inc.

Hitachi Global Storage
    Technologies

Samsung Electronics Incorporated

Toshiba Corporation

The term “independent” in this context refers to
    manufacturers that primarily produce disc drives as a
    stand-alone product, and the term “captive” refers to
    disc drive manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated
    entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain
    disc drives or other information storage products. Captive
    manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the
    ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard
    to the margins on individual components. Because components
    other than disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of
    the operating margin on a complete computer system than do disc
    drives, captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize
    a profit on the disc drives included in a computer system and,
    as a result, may be willing to sell disc drives to third parties
    at very low margins. Many captive manufacturers are also
    formidable competitors because they have more substantial
    resources than we do. In addition, Samsung and



Hitachi (together with affiliated entities) also sell other
    products to our customers, including critical components like
    flash memory, ASICs and flat panel displays, and may be willing
    to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their
    overall business strategy. This may improve their ability to
    compete with us. To the extent we are not successful competing
    with captive or independent disc drive manufacturers, our
    results of operations will be adversely affected.

In addition, in response to customer demand for high-quality,
    high-volume and low-cost disc drives, manufacturers of disc
    drives have had to develop large, in some cases global,
    production facilities with highly developed technological
    capabilities and internal controls. The development of large
    production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute
    to the intensification of competition. We also face indirect
    competition from present and potential customers who evaluate
    from time to time whether to manufacture their own disc drives
    or other information storage products.

We have also experienced competition from other companies that
    produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory,
    where increased capacity, improving cost, lower power
    consumption and performance ruggedness have resulted in
    competition with our lower capacity, smaller form factor disc
    drives in handheld applications. While this competition has
    traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer
    electronics applications like personal media players, these
    competitors have recently announced SSD products for notebook
    and enterprise compute applications. Some of these companies,
    like Samsung, also sell disc drives.

Volatility
    of Quarterly Results — Our quarterly operating results
    fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may
    cause our shares prices to decline.

In the past, our quarterly revenue and operating results have
    fluctuated significantly from period to period. We expect this
    fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons, including:

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our
    competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand;

•

delays or problems in the introduction of our new products,
    particularly new disc drives with lower cost structures due to
    inability to achieve high production yields, delays in customer
    qualification or initial product quality issues;

•

changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers;

•

increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies
    of raw materials or components;

•

the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we may
    engage in;

•

changes in the demand for the computer systems, storage
    subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our disc
    drives, due to seasonality and other factors;

•

changes in purchases from period to period by our primary
    customers, particularly, as our competitors are able to
    introduce and produce in volume competing disc drive solutions
    or alternative storage technology solutions, such as flash
    memory or SSDs;

•

shifting trends in customer demand which, when combined with
    overproduction of particular products, particularly at times
    such as the present time when the industry is served by multiple
    suppliers, results in supply/demand imbalances;

•

adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the United
    States and other major regions in which we do business;

•

our high proportion of fixed costs, including research and
    development expenses; and

•

announcements of new products, services or technological
    innovations by us or our competitors.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of
    our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and
    that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our
    future performance. Our operating



results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the
    expectations of investment research analysts or investors, which
    could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading
    price of our common shares.

New
    Product Offerings — Market acceptance of new product
    introductions cannot be accurately predicted, and our results of
    operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new
    products than is anticipated.

We are continually developing new products with the goal that we
    will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower
    cost disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors.
    We are particularly depending on the successful introduction,
    qualification and volume sales of new lower cost products for
    our results in the next few quarters.

The success of our new product introductions is dependent on a
    number of factors, including market acceptance, our ability to
    manage the risks associated with product transitions, the
    effective management of inventory levels in line with
    anticipated product demand, and the risk that our new products
    will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages
    of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those
    products. Accordingly, we cannot accurately determine the
    ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results
    of operations.

In addition, the success of our new product introductions is
    dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of
    supply with our OEM customers. In order for our products to be
    considered by our customers for qualification, we must be among
    the leaders in time-to-market with those new products. Once a
    product is accepted for qualification testing, any failure or
    delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we
    requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until
    new products are introduced. The limited number of high-volume
    OEMs magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification
    opportunity. These risks are further magnified because we expect
    competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining
    gross margins on our current generation products. We cannot
    assure you that we will be among the leaders in time-to-market
    with new products or that we will be able to successfully
    qualify new products with our customers in the future.

Smaller
    Form Factor Disc Drives — If we do not continue
    to successfully market smaller form factor disc drives, our
    business may suffer.

The disc drive industry is experiencing significant increases in
    sales of smaller form factor disc drives for an expanding number
    of applications, in particular notebook computers and consumer
    electronics devices, but also including personal computers and
    enterprise storage applications. Much of our recent revenue
    growth is derived from the sale of drives for small form factor
    drives for notebook and enterprise applications.

We have experienced competition from other companies that
    produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory,
    where increased capacity, improving cost, lower power
    consumption and performance ruggedness have resulted in
    competition with our lower capacity, smaller form factor disc
    drives in handheld applications. This competition has largely
    replaced disc drive products smaller than 1.8-inch with flash
    memory. However, we believe that disc drives continue to be well
    suited in applications requiring capacities of 20 gigabytes or
    more and that the demand for additional storage to store, hold
    or back up related media content from such handheld devices
    using flash memory, continues to grow. While this competition
    has traditionally been in the markets for handheld consumer
    electronics applications like digital music players and personal
    media players, these competitors are also attempting to
    introduce SSD products for notebook and enterprise compute
    applications.

If we do not suitably adapt our product offerings to
    successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disc
    drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage
    technology, or if flash competitors are successful in achieving
    customer acceptance of SSD products for notebook and enterprise
    compute applications, customers may decrease the amounts of our
    products that they purchase which would adversely affect our
    results of operations.



Perpendicular
    Recording Technology — If products based on this
    technology suffer unanticipated or atypical reliability or
    operability problems, our operating results will be adversely
    impacted. In addition, products based on perpendicular
    technology require increased quantities of precious metals and
    scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium which increases risk
    of higher costs and production delays that could adversely
    impact our operating results.

In fiscal year 2007, we converted more than half of our products
    to products using perpendicular technology and we expect that by
    the end of fiscal year 2008 that all of our products will be
    based on perpendicular technology. Perpendicular recording
    technology poses various technological challenges including a
    complex integration of the recording head, the disc, recording
    channel and drive firmware as a system.

If these perpendicular technology based products suffer
    unanticipated or atypical failures that were not anticipated in
    the design of those products, our service and warranty costs may
    materially increase which would adversely impact our operating
    results.

Perpendicular recording technology also requires recording media
    with more layers and the use of more precious metals and scarce
    alloys like platinum and ruthenium to create such layers. These
    precious metals and scarce alloys have recently become
    increasingly expensive and at times difficult to acquire. As our
    product offerings shift increasingly to perpendicular
    technology, we will be exposed to increased risks that higher
    costs or reduced availability of these precious metals and
    scarce alloys could adversely impact our operating results.

Seasonality —
    Because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products,
    our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted
    during our fourth fiscal quarter.

Because sales of computer systems, storage subsystems and
    consumer electronics tend to be seasonal, we expect to continue
    to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to
    variations in our customers’ demand for disc drives. In
    particular, we anticipate that sales of our products will
    continue to be lower during our fourth fiscal quarter than the
    rest of the year. In the desktop computer, notebook computer and
    consumer electronics sectors of our business, this seasonality
    is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales
    of personal computers and consumer electronics during the winter
    holiday season. In the enterprise sector of our business, our
    sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and
    purchasing cycles of our end users. Because our working capital
    needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production
    in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received, our
    operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the
    forecasted demand for our products proves accurate.

Furthermore, it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to
    which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods
    because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions
    and new product introductions, particularly in the consumer
    electronics market.

Difficulty
    in Predicting Quarterly Demand — If we fail to predict
    demand accurately for our products in any quarter, we may not be
    able to recapture the cost of our investments.

The disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles,
    with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the
    end of that quarter. Our manufacturing process requires us to
    make significant product-specific investments in inventory in
    each quarter for that quarter’s production. Because we
    typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after
    we have made our investments, there is a risk that our orders
    will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our
    investment before the products resulting from that investment
    have become obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be able
    to accurately predict demand in the future.

Other factors that may negatively impact our ability to
    recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include:

•

the impact of variable demand and the aggressive pricing
    environment for disc drives;

•

the impact of competitive product announcements and possible
    excess industry supply both with respect to particular disc
    drive products (particularly now that there are no material
    limitations on disc drive



component supply for our competitors), and with respect to
    competing alternative storage technology solutions such as SSDs
    in notebook and enterprise applications;

•

our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any
    quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy, which
    means that we make more capital investments than we would if we
    were not vertically integrated;

•

dependence on our ability to successfully qualify, manufacture
    and sell in increasing volumes on a cost-effective basis and
    with acceptable quality its disc drive products, particularly
    the new disc drive products with lower cost structures;

•

uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor
    customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of
    our total sales;

•

our product mix and the related margins of the various products;

•

accelerated reduction in the price of our disc drives due to
    technological advances

and/or

an
    oversupply of disc drives in the market, a condition that is
    exacerbated when the industry is served by multiple suppliers
    and shifting trends in demand which can create supply demand
    imbalances;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions, particularly at our major
    manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore and
    Thailand;

•

variations in the cost of components for our products;

•

limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a
    limited number of suppliers;

•

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the
    cost of producing our products and the effective price of our
    products to foreign consumers; and

•

operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated
    nature of our manufacturing processes.

Dependence
    on Sales of Disc Drives in Consumer Electronics
    Applications — Our sales of disc drives for consumer
    electronics applications which have contributed significant
    revenues to our results, can experience significant volatility
    due to seasonal and other factors which could materially
    adversely impact our future results of operations.

Our sales of disc drives for consumer electronics applications
    have contributed significant revenues to our results for the
    past several years. The growth rate in consumer electronics
    products has recently begun to moderate and show more seasonal
    demand variability. The demand for consumer electronics products
    can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for
    compute products. In some cases, our products manufactured for
    consumer electronics applications are uniquely configured for a
    single customer’s applications, which creates a risk of
    exposure if the anticipated volumes are not realized. This
    potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the
    possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like
    flash memory, meeting the customers’ cost and capacity
    metrics, resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products
    and disc drive technology, generally, to alternative storage
    technologies. Unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our
    products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to
    alternative storage technologies in new consumer electronics
    applications could materially adversely impact our future
    results of operations.

Dependence
    on Supply of Components, Equipment, and Raw
    Materials — If we experience shortages or delays in
    the receipt of critical components, equipment or raw materials
    necessary to manufacture our products, we may suffer lower
    operating margins, production delays and other material adverse
    effects.

The cost, quality and availability of components, certain
    equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disc drives and
    key components like recording media and heads are critical to
    our success. The equipment we use to manufacture our products
    and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few
    suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing
    equipment can be significant. Particularly important components
    for disc drives include read/write heads, aluminum or glass
    substrates for recording media, ASICs, spindle motors, printed
    circuit boards and suspension assemblies. We rely on sole
    suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for some of



these components, including recording media and aluminum and
    glass substrates that we do not manufacture, ASICs, spindle
    motors, printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies.
    Recently, substantially all of our purchases of recording media
    and a significant portion of our aluminum substrates from
    third-party suppliers have been sourced from Komag, which is in
    the process of being acquired by Western Digital. There can be
    no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain
    alternative supply following the purchase of Komag by Western
    Digital.

In the past, we have experienced increased costs and production
    delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or
    sufficient quantities of some components

and/or

have
    been forced to pay higher prices or make volume purchase
    commitments or advance deposits for some components, equipment
    or raw materials, such as precious metals like platinum and
    ruthenium, that were in short supply in the industry in general.

Historically, the technology sector specifically, and the
    economy generally have experienced economic pressure, which has
    resulted in consolidation among component manufacturers and may
    result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or
    not making sufficient investments in research to develop new
    components.

If there is a shortage of, or delay in supplying us with,
    critical components, equipment or raw materials, then:

•

it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and, if
    we could not pass these price increases to our customers, our
    operating margin would decline;

•

we might have to reengineer some products, which would likely
    cause production and shipment delays, make the reengineered
    products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of return
    on these products;

•

we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to
    certain of our products and ship less of others, which could
    reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to
    customers who could purchase more of their required products
    from manufacturers that either did not experience these
    shortages or delays or that made different allocations; and

•

we might be late in shipping products, causing potential
    customers to make purchases from our competitors, thus causing
    our revenue and operating margin to decline.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical
    components in a timely and economic manner, or at all.

Importance
    of Reducing Operating Costs — If we do not reduce our
    operating expenses, we will not be able to compete effectively
    in our industry.

Our strategy involves, to a substantial degree, increasing
    revenue and product volume while at the same time reducing
    operating expenses. In the past, these activities have included
    closures and transfers of facilities, significant personnel
    reductions and efforts to increase automation. Moreover, the
    reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely
    affect our ability to manufacture our products in required
    volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other
    disruptions that affect our products and customer service. In
    addition, the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to
    a different facility frequently requires qualification of the
    new facility by some of our OEM customers. We cannot assure you
    that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a
    cost-effective basis without delays or disruption in our
    production and without adversely affecting our customer
    relationships and results of operations.

Industry
    Demand — Changes in demand for computer systems and
    storage subsystems has caused and may cause in the future a
    decline in demand for our products.

Our disc drives are components in computers, computer systems,
    storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices. The demand
    for these products has been volatile. In a weak economy,
    consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for
    personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to
    decrease, as does enterprise demand for computer systems and
    storage subsystems. Unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer
    systems and storage subsystems generally cause sharp declines in
    demand for disc drive products.



Additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the
    past have included announcements or introductions of major new
    operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in
    consumer preferences, such as the shift from desktop to notebook
    computers. We believe these announcements and introductions have
    from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and
    made inventory obsolete. Whenever an oversupply of disc drives
    causes participants in our industry to have higher than
    anticipated inventory levels, we experience even more intense
    price competition from other disc drive manufacturers than usual.

Dependence
    on Distributors — We are dependent on sales to
    distributors, which may increase price erosion and the
    volatility of our sales.

A substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of
    desktop disc drive products. Product qualification programs in
    this distribution channel are limited, which increases the
    number of competing products that are available to satisfy
    demand, particularly in times of lengthening product cycles. As
    a result, purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely
    on price, terms and product availability. Sales volumes through
    this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater
    volatility than sales to our OEM customers.

To the extent that distributors reduce their purchases of our
    products or prices decline significantly in the distribution
    channel, and to the extent that our distributor relationships
    are terminated, our revenues and results of operations would be
    adversely affected.

Importance
    of Time-to-Market — Our operating results may depend
    on our being among the first-to-market and achieving sufficient
    production volume with our new products.

To achieve consistent success with our OEM customers, it is
    important that we be an early provider of new types of disc
    drives featuring leading, high-quality technology and lower per
    gigabyte storage cost. Historically, our operating results have
    substantially depended upon our ability to be among the
    first-to-market with new product offerings. Our market share and
    operating results in the future may be adversely affected if we
    fail to:

•

consistently maintain our time-to-market performance with our
    new products;

•

produce these products in sufficient volume;

•

qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by
    meeting our customers’ performance and quality
    specifications; or

•

achieve acceptable manufacturing yields, quality and costs with
    these products.

If delivery of our products is delayed, our OEM customers may
    use our competitors’ products to meet their production
    requirements. If the delay of our products causes delivery of
    those OEMs’ computer systems into which our products are
    integrated to be delayed, consumers and businesses may purchase
    comparable products from the OEMs’ competitors.

Moreover, we face the related risk that consumers and businesses
    may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new
    product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released.
    If this were to occur, we may be unable to sell our existing
    inventory of products that may have become less efficient and
    cost effective compared to new products. As a result, even if we
    are among the first-to-market with a given product, subsequent
    introductions or announcements by our competitors of new
    products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a
    positive return on our investment in existing products and
    inventory.

Accounting
    Charges and Pre-Acquisition Contingencies not Previously
    Identified Related to Acquisition of Maxtor — We
    expect the acquisition of Maxtor with Seagate will continue to
    result in additional accounting charges, that may continue to
    have an adverse effect on our fiscal year 2008 operating
    results.

We expect that, as a result of the acquisition of Maxtor, our
    fiscal year 2008 results of operations will continue to be
    adversely affected by non-cash accounting charges, the most
    significant of which relates to the amortization of acquired
    intangible assets. In addition, pre-acquisition contingencies
    not previously identified will adversely affect our results of
    operations.



Dependence
    on Key Customers — We may be adversely affected by the
    loss of, or reduced, delayed or cancelled purchases by, one or
    more of our larger customers.

Some of our key customers, including HP, Dell, Sony Corporation
    (“Sony”), EMC and IBM, account for a large portion of
    our disc drive revenue. Our recent acquisition of Maxtor may
    increase our business with certain of our larger customers. We
    have longstanding relationships with many of our customers,
    however, if any of our key customers were to significantly
    reduce their purchases from us, our results of operations would
    be adversely affected. While sales to major customers may vary
    from period to period, a major customer that permanently
    discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us
    could be difficult to replace. In line with industry practice,
    new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and
    rigorous qualification process at the customer’s cost.
    Accordingly, it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new
    major customers. Additionally, mergers, acquisitions,
    consolidations or other significant transactions involving our
    customers generally entail risks to our business. If a
    significant transaction involving any of our key customers
    results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key
    customers, it could have a materially adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations, financial condition and
    prospects.

Impact
    of Technological Change — Increases in the areal
    density of disc drives may outpace customers’ demand for
    storage capacity.

The rate of increase in areal density, or storage capacity per
    square inch on a disc, may be greater than the increase in our
    customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity,
    particularly in certain market applications like commercial
    desktop compute. As a result, our customers’ storage
    capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced, low capacity
    disc drives. These factors could decrease our sales, especially
    when combined with continued price erosion, which could
    adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes
    in Information Storage Products — Future changes in
    the nature of information storage products may reduce demand for
    traditional disc drive products.

We expect that in the future, new personal computing devices and
    products will be developed, some of which, such as Internet
    appliances, may not contain a disc drive. While we are investing
    development resources in designing disc drives for new
    applications, it is too early to assess the impact of these new
    applications on future demand for disc drive products. Products
    using alternative technologies, such as flash memory, optical
    storage and other storage technologies could become a
    significant source of competition to particular applications of
    our products, which could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

New
    Product Development and Technological Change — If we
    do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological
    changes, our operating results will be adversely
    affected.

Our customers have demanded new generations of disc drive
    products as advances in computer hardware and software have
    created the need for improved storage products, with features
    such as increased storage capacity, improved performance and
    reliability and lower cost. We, and our competitors, have
    developed improved products, and we will need to continue to do
    so in the future. For the fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we
    had product development expenses of $904 million,
    $805 million and $645 million, respectively. We cannot
    assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the
    design or introduction of new products in a timely manner, that
    we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient
    volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields, that we will be
    able to successfully market these new products or that these
    products will perform to specifications on a long-term basis. In
    addition, the impact of slowing areal density growth may
    adversely impact our ability to be successful.

When we develop new products with higher capacity and more
    advanced technology, our operating results may decline because
    the increased difficulty and complexity associated with
    producing these products increases the likelihood of
    reliability, quality or operability problems. If our products
    suffer increases in failures, are of low quality or are not
    reliable, customers may reduce their purchases of our products
    and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and
    warranty costs may increase. In addition, a decline in the
    reliability of our products may make us less competitive as
    compared with other disc drive manufacturers.



Risks
    Associated with Future Acquisitions — We may not be
    able to identify suitable strategic alliance, acquisition or
    investment opportunities, or successfully acquire and integrate
    companies that provide complementary products or
    technologies.

Our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances
    with, and making acquisitions of or investments in, other
    companies that are complementary to our business. There is
    substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance,
    acquisition and investment candidates. We may not be able to
    identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic
    partnership candidates. Even if we were able to identify them,
    we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with,
    acquire or invest in suitable candidates, or integrate acquired
    technologies or operations successfully into our existing
    technologies and operations. Our ability to finance potential
    acquisitions will be limited by our high degree of leverage, the
    covenants contained in the indentures that govern our
    outstanding indebtedness, the credit agreement that governs our
    senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing
    any other debt we may incur.

If we are successful in acquiring other companies, these
    acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating
    results, particularly while the operations of the acquired
    business are being integrated. It is also likely that
    integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key
    employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those
    companies. In addition, the integration of any acquired
    companies would require substantial attention from our senior
    management, which may limit the amount of time available to be
    devoted to our day-to-day operations or to the execution of our
    strategy. Growth by acquisition involves an even higher degree
    of risk to the extent we combine new product offerings and enter
    new markets in which we have limited experience, and no
    assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or
    alternative business models, such as our recent acquisition of
    EVault, will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated
    objectives. Furthermore, the expansion of our business involves
    the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively, that
    we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or
    investments and that we would incur substantial charges relating
    to the write-off of in-process research and development, similar
    to that which we incurred in connection with several of our
    prior acquisitions. Each of these items could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position and results of
    operations.

In addition, we could issue additional common shares in
    connection with future acquisitions. For example, in May 2006,
    we issued approximately 97 million of our common shares in
    connection with our acquisition of Maxtor Corporation. Issuing
    shares in connection with acquisitions would have the effect of
    diluting your ownership percentage of the common shares and
    could cause the price of our common shares to decline.

Risk
    of Intellectual Property Litigation — Our products may
    infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may
    cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling
    our products.

We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not
    infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of
    others. Historically, patent applications in the United States
    and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed
    until the patent is issued, and we may not be aware of currently
    filed patent applications that relate to our products or
    technology. If patents are later issued on these applications,
    we may be liable for infringement. We may be subject to legal
    proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged infringement
    of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property
    rights of third parties by us, or our licensees in connection
    with their use of our products.

We are
    currently subject to lawsuits involving intellectual property
    claims brought by Convolve, Inc. and the Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology in the United States, Shao Tong in Nanjing, China
    and Siemens AG and StorMedia Texas LLC in the United States
    which could cause us to incur significant additional costs or
    prevent us from selling our products; which could adversely
    effect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Intellectual property litigation is expensive and
    time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could
    divert our management’s attention from operating our
    business. In addition, intellectual property lawsuits are
    subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the
    technical issues involved, and we cannot assure you that we will
    be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual
    property claims. Moreover, patent litigation



has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the
    increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in
    the field. If we were to discover that our products infringe the
    intellectual property rights of others, we would need to obtain
    licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our
    products in order to avoid infringement. We might not be able to
    obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or
    be able to reengineer our products successfully. Moreover, if we
    are sued for patent infringement and lose the suit, we could be
    required to pay substantial damages

and/or

be
    enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or
    technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur
    significant costs and prevent us from selling our products which
    could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Dependence
    on Key Personnel — The loss of some key executive
    officers and employees could negatively impact our business
    prospects.

Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the
    continued service of key members of management as well as
    marketing, sales and product development personnel. The loss of
    one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. We believe our future success will also depend in
    large part upon our ability to attract, retain and further
    motivate highly skilled management, marketing, sales and product
    development personnel. We have experienced intense competition
    for personnel, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to
    retain our key employees or that we will be successful in
    attracting, assimilating and retaining personnel in the future.

Substantial
    Leverage — Our substantial leverage may place us at a
    competitive disadvantage in our industry.

We are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
    Our significant debt and debt service requirements could
    adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may
    limit our ability to take advantage of potential business
    opportunities. For example, our high level of debt presents the
    following risks:

•

we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt,
    thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund
    working capital, capital expenditures, product development
    efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and
    other general corporate requirements;

•

our interest expense could increase if prevailing interest rates
    increase, because a substantial portion of our debt bears
    interest at floating rates;

•

our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic
    downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and
    could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those
    of our competitors that are less leveraged;

•

our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in
    planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our
    industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business
    opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in
    the future and implement our business strategies;

•

our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional
    financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital
    expenditures, product development efforts, strategic
    acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general
    corporate requirements; and

•

covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay
    dividends or make other restricted payments and investments.

Significant
    Debt Service Requirements — Servicing our debt
    requires a significant amount of cash and our ability to
    generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our
    control.

Our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient
    to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on, our
    indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, including
    working capital, capital expenditures, product development
    efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and
    other general corporate requirements.



Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic,
    financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other
    factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that:

•

our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;

•

we will continue to realize the cost savings, revenue growth and
    operating improvements that resulted from the execution of our
    long-term strategic plan; or

•

future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts
    sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs.

If we cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take
    actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures,
    product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments
    and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our
    debt, or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you
    that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on
    commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our
    existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant
    amount of additional debt. If we incur additional debt above the
    levels now in effect, the risks associated with our substantial
    leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service
    our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity
    needs, could intensify.

Restrictions
    Imposed by Debt Covenants — Restrictions imposed by
    our existing credit facility may limit our ability to finance
    future operations or capital needs or engage in other business
    activities that may be in our interest.

Our existing credit facility imposes, and the terms of any
    future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us.
    Our existing credit facility may also limit, among other things,
    our ability to:

•

pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our shares;

•

redeem or repurchase shares;

•

make investments or other restricted payments;

•

sell assets;

•

issue or sell shares of restricted subsidiaries;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

create liens; and

•

effect a consolidation or merger.

These covenants are subject to a number of important
    qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions that permit
    us to make significant dividends.

Our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with
    specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these
    ratios may be affected by events beyond our control.

A breach of any of the covenants described above or our
    inability to comply with the required financial ratios could
    result in a default under our credit facility. If a default
    occurs, the Administrative Agent of the credit facility may
    elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations under the
    credit facility, together with accrued interest and other fees,
    to be immediately due and payable. If our outstanding
    indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that
    our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and
    any potential future indebtedness, which would cause the market
    price of our common shares to decline significantly.

System
    Failures — System failures caused by events beyond our
    control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic
    data on which our operations depend.

Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our
    computer equipment and the information stored in our databases
    from damage by, among other things, earthquake, fire, natural
    disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized
    intrusion and other catastrophic events. As our operations
    become more automated and increasingly interdependent, our
    exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will
    increase. We do not



have a contingency plan for addressing the kinds of events
    referred to in this paragraph that would be sufficient to
    prevent system failures and other interruptions in our
    operations that could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial condition.

Economic
    Risks Associated with International Operations — Our
    international operations subject us to risks related to currency
    exchange fluctuations, longer payment cycles for sales in
    foreign countries, seasonality and disruptions in foreign
    markets, tariffs and duties, price controls, potential adverse
    tax consequences, increased costs, our customers’ credit
    and access to capital and health-related risks.

We have significant operations in foreign countries, including
    manufacturing facilities, sales personnel and customer support
    operations. We have manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia,
    Northern Ireland, Singapore and Thailand, in addition to those
    in the United States. A substantial portion of our desktop disc
    drive assembly occurs in our facility in China.

Our international operations are subject to economic risks
    inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including the
    following:

•

Disruptions in Foreign Markets.

Disruptions in
    financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying
    economic conditions in the past in some countries, including
    those in Asia, have had an impact on our sales to customers
    located in, or whose end-user customers are located in, these
    countries.

•

Fluctuations in Currency Exchange
    Rates.

Prices for our products are denominated
    predominately in U.S. dollars, even when sold to customers
    that are located outside the United States. Currency instability
    in Asia and other geographic markets may make our products more
    expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are
    priced in the local currency. Moreover, many of the costs
    associated with our operations located outside the United States
    are denominated in local currencies. As a consequence, the
    increased strength of local currencies against the
    U.S. dollar in countries where we have foreign operations
    would result in higher effective operating costs and,
    potentially, reduced earnings. From time to time, fluctuations
    in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our
    operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that
    these fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and
    profitability in the future.

•

Longer Payment Cycles.

Our customers outside
    of the United States are often allowed longer time periods for
    payment than our U.S. customers. This increases the risk of
    nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition
    of particular customers may worsen during the course of the
    payment period.

•

Seasonality.

Seasonal reductions in the
    business activities of our customers during the summer months,
    particularly in Europe, typically result in lower earnings
    during those periods.

•

Tariffs, Duties, Limitations on Trade and Price
    Controls.

Our international operations are
    affected by limitations on imports, currency exchange control
    regulations, transfer pricing regulations, price controls and
    other restraints on trade. In addition, the governments of many
    countries, including China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, in
    which we have significant operating assets, have exercised and
    continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of
    their domestic economies and international trade.

•

Potential Adverse Tax Consequences.

Our
    international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax
    consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes
    on payments by subsidiaries.

•

Increased Costs.

The shipping and
    transportation costs associated with our international
    operations are typically higher than those associated with our
    U.S. operations, resulting in decreased operating margins
    in some foreign countries.

•

Credit and Access to Capital Risks.

Our
    international customers could have reduced access to working
    capital due to higher interest rates, reduced bank lending
    resulting from contractions in the money supply or the
    deterioration in the customer’s or its bank’s
    financial condition, or the inability to access other financing.



Political
    Risks Associated with International Operations — Our
    international operations subject us to risks related to
    political unrest and terrorism.

We have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that
    periodically experience political unrest. This could disrupt our
    ability to manufacture important components as well as cause
    interruptions

and/or

delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for
    continued manufacture and assembly. Any such delays or
    interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill
    orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operation
    and financial condition. U.S. and international responses
    to the ongoing hostilities in Afghanistan and Iraq and the risk
    of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could
    exacerbate these risks.

Legal
    and Operational Risks Associated with International
    Operations — Our international operations subject us
    to risks related to staffing and management, legal and
    regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual
    property.

Operating outside of the United States creates difficulties
    associated with staffing and managing our international
    manufacturing facilities, complying with local legal and
    regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual
    property. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be found
    to be operating in compliance with applicable customs, currency
    exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or
    any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject. We
    also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified.

SOX
    404 Compliance — While we believe that we currently
    have adequate internal control procedures in place, we are still
    exposed to future risks of non-compliance and will continue to
    incur costs associated with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

We have completed the evaluation of our internal controls over
    financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although our assessment, testing,
    and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of
    June 29, 2007, our internal controls over financial
    reporting were effective, we cannot predict the outcome of our
    testing in future periods. If our internal controls are
    ineffective in future periods, our financial results or the
    market price of our shares could be adversely affected. We will
    incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s
    time in connection with further evaluations.

Volatile
    Public Markets — The price of our common shares may be
    volatile and could decline significantly.

The stock market in general, and the market for technology
    stocks in particular, has recently experienced volatility that
    has often been unrelated to the operating performance of
    companies. If these market or industry-based fluctuations
    continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline
    significantly independent of our actual operating performance,
    and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment.
    The market price of our common shares could fluctuate
    significantly in response to several factors, including among
    others:

•

actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;

•

announcements of innovations, new products or significant price
    reductions by us or our competitors, including those competitors
    who offer alternative storage technology solutions;

•

our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment
    research analysts;

•

the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of
    significant contracts or acquisitions;

•

general stock market conditions;

•

the occurrence of major catastrophic events;

•

changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts;
    and

•

the sale of our common shares held by certain equity investors
    or members of management.



Failure
    to Pay Quarterly Dividends — Our failure to pay
    quarterly dividends to our common shareholders could cause the
    market price of our common shares to decline
    significantly.

We paid quarterly dividends aggregating $0.38 per share on
    September 1, 2006, November 17, 2006,
    February 16, 2007 and May 18, 2007 to our common
    shareholders of record as of August 18, 2006,
    November 3, 2006, February 2, 2007 and May 4,
    2007, respectively. On July 19, 2007, we declared a
    quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share that was paid by
    August 17, 2007 to our common shareholders of record as of
    August 3, 2007.

Our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to, among
    other things, general business conditions within the disc drive
    industry, our financial results, the impact of paying dividends
    on our credit ratings, and legal and contractual restrictions on
    the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to
    our common shareholders, including restrictions imposed by the
    credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. Any
    reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause
    the market price of our common shares to decline significantly.
    Our payment of dividends to holders of our common shares may in
    certain future quarters result in upward adjustments to the
    conversion rate of the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2012. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly dividends
    is reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume
    paying dividends at historical levels could result in a
    persistently low market valuation of our common shares.

Potential
    Governmental Action — Governmental action against
    companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a
    reduction in the demand for our common shares.

Recent federal and state legislation has been proposed, and
    additional legislation may be proposed in the future which, if
    enacted, could have an adverse tax impact on either Seagate or
    its shareholders. For example, the eligibility for favorable tax
    treatment of taxable distributions paid to
    U.S. shareholders of Seagate as qualified dividends could
    be eliminated.

Securities
    Litigation — Significant fluctuations in the market
    price of our common shares could result in securities class
    action claims against us.

Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with
    respect to the publicly traded securities of disc drive
    companies and technology companies generally. The price of our
    common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the
    past, following periods of decline in the market price of a
    company’s securities, class action lawsuits have often been
    pursued against that company. If similar litigation were pursued
    against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion
    of management’s attention and resources, which could
    materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial
    condition and liquidity.

Performance
    Graph

The performance graph below shows the cumulative total
    shareholder return on our common shares for the period starting
    on December 11, 2002, which was the initial trading date of
    the common shares, to June 29, 2007. This is compared with
    the cumulative total return of the Dow Jones US Computer
    Hardware Index and the Standard & Poor’s 500
    Stock Index over the same period. The graph assumes that on
    December 11, 2002, $100 was invested in our common shares
    and $100 was invested in each of the other two indices, with
    dividends reinvested on the date of payment without payment of
    any commissions. Dollar amounts in the graph are rounded to the
    nearest whole dollar. The performance shown in the graph
    represents past performance and should not be considered an
    indication of future performance.

Seagate Technology operates on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year
    which ends on the Friday closest to June 30. Accordingly,
    the last trading day of Seagate Technology’s fiscal year
    may vary. Fiscal year 2005 was 52 weeks long and ended on
    July 1, 2005. Fiscal year 2006 was 52 weeks long and
    ended on June 30, 2006. Fiscal year 2007 was 52 weeks

Dividends

We are currently paying our shareholders a quarterly dividend of
    no more than $0.10 per share (up to $0.40 per share annually) so
    long as the aggregate amount of the dividend does not exceed 50%
    of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100% of net cash
    proceeds received from the issuance of capital all of which are



measured from the period beginning June 30, 2001 and ending
    the most recent fiscal quarter in which financial statements are
    internally available.

We are restricted in our ability to pay dividends by the
    covenants contained in the revolving credit facility. Our
    declaration of dividends is also subject to Cayman Islands law
    and the discretion of our board of directors. Under the terms of
    the Seagate Technology shareholders agreement (which was amended
    on September 2, 2004) at least seven members of our
    board of directors must approve the payment of dividends in
    excess of 15% of our net income in the prior fiscal year
    (provided that such consent is not required to declare and pay
    our regular quarterly dividend of up to $0.10 per share). In
    deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends, our
    directors will take into account such factors as general
    business conditions within the disc drive industry, our
    financial results, our capital requirements, contractual and
    legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our
    subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, the impact of
    paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as
    our board of directors may deem relevant.

Since the closing of our initial public offering in December
    2002, we have paid dividends, pursuant to our quarterly dividend
    policy totaling approximately $604 million in the
    aggregate. The following are dividends paid in the last two
    fiscal years:

Because we had current earnings and profits in excess of
    distributions for our taxable year ended June 29, 2007,
    distributions on our common shares to U.S. shareholders
    during this period were treated as dividend income for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes. We anticipate that we
    will have earnings and profits in excess of distributions in
    fiscal year 2008. Therefore, distributions to
    U.S. shareholders in fiscal year 2008 are anticipated to be
    treated as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax
    purposes.

Non-U.S. shareholders

should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax
    treatment.

Furthermore, we believe that we were a foreign personal holding
    company for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our
    taxable years ended July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004.
    Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, foreign
    corporations will be excluded from the application of the
    personal holding company rules of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Code”), effective for taxable
    years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31,
    2004. For us, the effective date was our fiscal year beginning
    July 2, 2005. As a result, if taxable distributions on our
    common shares are made after July 1, 2005,
    U.S. shareholders who are individuals may be eligible for
    reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income
    (currently a maximum rate of 15%) on distributions made after
    the effective date.

Repurchases
    of Our Equity Securities

On August 8, 2006, we announced that our board of directors
    had authorized the use of up to $2.5 billion for the
    repurchase of our outstanding common shares over a two-year
    period. From the authorization of this repurchase program and
    through the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, we repurchased
    approximately 62.0 million shares at an average price of
    $24.62, all of which were considered cancelled and are no longer
    outstanding. We repurchased these shares through a combination
    of open market purchases and prepaid forward agreements with
    large financial institutions, according to which we prepaid the
    financial institutions a fixed amount to deliver a variable
    number of shares at future dates. We entered into these
    agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at
    a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price
    (“VWAP”) of our common shares. Our policy to date



has been to enter into such transactions only when the discount
    that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash
    prepayment to the financial institution. There were no explicit
    commissions or fees on these prepaid forward agreements. Under
    the terms of these agreements, there was no requirement for the
    financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment
    to us. These prepaid forward agreements were not derivatives
    because the Company had prepaid all amounts and had no remaining
    obligation. The agreements do not contain an embedded
    derivative. The prepayments were recorded as a reduction to
    shareholders’ equity when paid and the shares were deducted
    from shares outstanding. The agreements require the physical
    delivery of shares; there were no settlement alternatives,
    except in the case of certain defined extraordinary events which
    are outside the control of Seagate and the financial
    institutions. The parameters used to calculate the final number
    of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the
    contract and the average VWAP of our common shares during the
    contract period less the agreed upon discount. The contracts are
    indexed solely to the price of Seagate’s common shares.

During fiscal year 2007, we repurchased 24.3 million shares
    through open market repurchases. In addition, we made payments
    totaling $950 million under prepaid forward agreements and
    took delivery of 37.7 million shares using prepaid forward
    agreements. Shares physically delivered to us were cancelled and
    are no longer outstanding. At June 29, 2007, there were no
    outstanding prepaid forward agreements to repurchase our common
    shares.

As of June 29, 2007, we had approximately $974 million
    remaining under the authorized $2.5 billion stock
    repurchase program. Share repurchases during fiscal year 2007
    were as follows:

    outstanding authority for further shares to be purchased under

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion of the financial condition and
    results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 29,
    2007, June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005. Unless the
    context indicates otherwise, as used herein, the terms
    “we,” “us” and “our” refer to
    Seagate Technology, an exempted company incorporated with
    limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and its
    subsidiaries.

You should read this discussion in conjunction with
    “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and
    “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” included elsewhere in this report. Except as noted,
    references to any fiscal year mean the twelve-month period
    ending on the Friday closest to June 30 of that year.

Our
    Company

We are the leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of
    rigid disc drives. Rigid disc drives, which are commonly
    referred to as disc drives or hard drives, are used as the
    primary medium for storing electronic information in systems
    ranging from desktop and notebook computers, and consumer
    electronics devices to data centers delivering information over
    corporate networks and the Internet. We produce a broad range of
    disc drive products addressing enterprise applications, where
    our products are used in enterprise servers, mainframes and
    workstations; desktop applications, where our products are used
    in desktop computers; mobile computing applications, where our
    products are used in notebook computers; and consumer
    electronics applications, where our products are used in a wide
    variety of devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs),
    gaming devices and other consumer electronic devices that
    require storage. We also sell under the Seagate and Maxtor
    brands storage products containing our disc drives.

We sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment
    manufacturers (OEMs), and also market to distributors under our
    globally recognized brand names. For the fiscal years 2007, 2006
    and 2005, approximately 64%, 72% and 72%, respectively, of our
    disc drive revenue was from sales to OEMs, of which
    Hewlett-Packard was the only customer exceeding 10% of our disc
    drive revenue in all of these respective periods while Dell
    exceeded 10% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2006 and
    2005. We have longstanding relationships with many of our OEM
    customers. We also have key relationships with major
    distributors, who sell our disc drive products to small OEMs,
    dealers, system integrators and retailers throughout most of the
    world. Shipments to distributors were approximately 30%, 25% and
    26% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Retail sales in fiscal year 2007, as a
    percentage of our disc drive revenue, was 6%, compared to 3% and
    2% in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. For fiscal years
    2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 30%, 30% and 31%,
    respectively, of our disc drive revenue came from customers
    located in North America, approximately 27%, 27% and 28%,
    respectively, came from customers located in Europe and
    approximately 43%, 43% and 41%, respectively, came from
    customers located in the Far East. Substantially all of our
    revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.



In addition to manufacturing and selling disc drives and branded
    storage products, we provide data storage services for small to
    medium size businesses, including online backup, data protection
    and recovery solutions through EVault, Inc.
    (“EVault”), which we acquired in fiscal year 2007.

Industry
    Overview

Our industry is characterized by several trends that have a
    material impact on our strategic planning, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Disc
    Drive Industry Consolidation

Due to the significant challenges posed by the need to
    continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency and
    because of the increasing amounts of capital and research and
    development expenditure required, the disc drive industry has
    undergone significant consolidation as disc drive manufacturers
    and component suppliers merged with other companies or exited
    the industry. Through such combinations, disc drive
    manufacturers have also become increasingly vertically
    integrated. Our recent acquisition of Maxtor Corporation
    (“Maxtor”) in May 2006 is an example of such
    industry consolidation. In March 2007, TDK, a disc drive head
    manufacturer, announced its pending acquisition of Alps, also a
    disc drive head manufacturer, while in June 2007, Western
    Digital announced that it is acquiring Komag. We believe
    industry consolidation is likely to continue in the disc drive
    industry through combinations of disc drive manufacturers,
    component manufacturers, or both, as the technological
    challenges and the associated levels of required investment
    grow, increasing the competitive necessity of larger-scale
    operations.

Price
    Erosion

Our industry has been characterized by continuous price erosion
    for disc drive products with comparable capacity, performance
    and feature sets (i.e., “like-for-like products”).
    Price erosion for like-for-like products is more pronounced
    during periods of:

•

industry consolidation in which competitors aggressively use
    discounted price to gain market share;

•

few new product introductions when multiple competitors have
    comparable or alternative product offerings;

•

temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand; and

•

seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply.

Disc drive manufacturers typically attempt to off-set price
    erosion with an improved mix of disc drive products
    characterized by higher capacity, better performance and
    additional feature sets

and/or

product cost reductions.

We expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for
    the foreseeable future. To remain competitive, we believe it
    will be necessary to continue to reduce our prices as well as
    introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced
    technologies prior to that of our competitors to take advantage
    of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost
    structure on these new products. We have established production
    facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand to achieve
    cost reductions.

Disc
    Drive Industry Demand Trends

We believe that the disc drive industry is experiencing the
    following growth trends relative to overall unit demand,
    including:

•

The broad, global expansion of the creation, aggregation,
    distribution and consumption of all types of digital content has
    resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data
    storage hardware solutions that either directly utilize disc
    drives or indirectly drive the demand for additional disc drive
    storage to store, host or back up related digital content.

•

The need to address the expansion in data storage management
    requirements has increased the demand for new hardware storage
    solutions for both mission critical and business critical
    enterprise storage.

Many enterprises are moving away from the use of server-attached
    storage to network-attached storage for mission critical
    enterprise storage. We expect the market for these solutions
    will likely grow, resulting in



greater opportunities for the sale of high-performance, high
    capacity disc drives. Many enterprises are also consolidating
    data centers, aiming to increase speed and reliability within a
    smaller space, reduce network complexity and increase energy
    savings. This has led to an increased demand for more energy
    efficient, small form factor disc drives. Recently, solid state
    drive (SSDs) storage application that uses flash storage
    technology as an alternative to disc drive storage technology,
    has been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant
    system startup or boot disc drives.

In addition to the growth in mission critical enterprise
    storage, there has also been significant growth in the use of
    high capacity, enterprise class serial advanced technology
    architecture (SATA) products in business critical storage
    systems used by enterprises to store and access
    capacity-intensive non-critical data. This application is
    exemplified by growth in content aggregation and distribution by
    companies like Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and News Corp as well as
    storage service providers. We believe that this growth in demand
    for disc drives for use in business critical storage systems is
    likely to shift some demand from disc drives used in traditional
    mission critical enterprise storage in the longer term.

•

The mobile computing market is expected to grow faster than that
    for desktop computers as price and performance continue to
    improve. Notebooks are increasingly replacing desktop computers
    and are progressively more desirable to consumers as the need
    for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to
    advance. We estimate that in fiscal year 2007, industry
    shipments of disc drives for mobile compute applications grew
    approximately 35% from fiscal year 2006.

The disc drive industry has recently introduced new hybrid disc
    drives that add flash memory to a disc drive to provide
    customers with a single, integrated solution with enhanced
    performance, better power utilization, quicker

start-up

speed and prolonged disc drive durability. Certain companies
    have also recently introduced SSDs for the mobile compute
    applications that directly compete with mobile disc drives. The
    current cost per gigabyte for SSDs is significantly higher than
    the cost per gigabyte for disc drives and is projected to remain
    higher for the foreseeable future, which we believe will largely
    inhibit the use of SSDs in many price-sensitive mass-market
    mobile compute applications.

•

While we believe growth in disc drives for desktop computing has
    recently moderated, in part due to the shift from desktop
    computers to notebook computers, particularly in developed
    countries. We believe that current growth in demand for disc
    drives in desktop computing is concentrated in developing
    markets where price remains a primary consideration in compute
    application data storage purchases.

•

Disc drives in the consumer electronics markets are primarily
    for use in DVRs and gaming consoles which require more storage
    capability than can be provided in a cost-effective manner with
    alternative technologies such as flash memory, which are better
    suited to lower capacity consumer electronics applications. We
    believe the demand for disc drives in consumer electronics will
    become more pronounced with the increased amount of high
    definition content that requires larger amounts of storage
    capacity. With respect to handheld applications, we believe disc
    drive products smaller than 1.8-inch form factors have to a
    large extent been replaced by competing storage technologies,
    such as solid state or flash memory. However, we believe that
    disc drives continue to be well suited in applications requiring
    capacities of 20 gigabytes or more, and that the demand for disc
    drives as additional storage to store, hold or back up related
    media content from such handheld devices, continues to grow.

•

We believe that industry demand for storage products is
    increasing due to the proliferation of media-rich digital
    content in consumer applications and is fuelling increased
    consumer demand for storage. This has led to the expansion of
    solutions such as external storage products to provide
    additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of
    disaster or system failure, or to provide independent storage
    solutions for multiple users in home or small business
    environments.

We believe that for some of the fastest growing applications
    described above, the demand is focused on higher capacity disc
    drive products.



Product
    Life Cycles and Changing Technology

Our industry has been characterized by significant advances in
    technology, which have contributed to rapid product life cycles,
    the importance of either being first to market with new products
    or quickly achieving product cost effectiveness as well as
    difficulty in recovering research and development expenses.
    Also, there is a continued need to successfully execute product
    transitions and new product introductions, as factors such as
    quality, reliability and manufacturing yields become of
    increasing competitive importance.

To address the growing demand for higher capacity products, the
    industry is undergoing a transition to perpendicular recording
    technology, which is necessary to achieve continued growth in
    areal density. Perpendicular recording technology poses various
    technological challenges, including a complex integration of the
    recording head, the disc, recording channel and drive firmware
    as a system, and involves the use of certain precious metals,
    such as ruthenium, which has been in limited supply and
    increasingly expensive.

Seasonality

The disc drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal
    variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second
    half of the calendar year. This seasonality is driven by
    consumer spending in the back-to-school season from late summer
    to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to
    winter. In addition, corporate demand is higher during the
    second half of the calendar year when IT budget calendars
    typically provide for more spending. We expect normal industry
    seasonal patterns of increased demand for the September quarter.

Recording
    Media

Consistent with our expectations that the disc drive industry
    will continue to consolidate and integrate, Western Digital is
    in the process of acquiring Komag, a third-party supplier of
    recording media. Although this transaction may limit
    Komag’s supply of media to the disc drive industry in the
    long-term, we believe that there is adequate supply to meet
    currently identified industry demand, and that there is enough
    time to readjust supply chains if needed.

Raw
    Material Constraints

Perpendicular recording technology requires more layers and the
    use of more precious metals and scarce alloys in the sputtering
    process required to create such layers. As a result, products
    utilizing perpendicular recording technology are more sensitive
    to fluctuations in prices and availability of precious metals
    and scarce alloys such as platinum and ruthenium. As product
    offerings transition to perpendicular recording technology,
    companies will be required to maintain an increased inventory of
    these precious metals and scarce alloys.

Industry
    Supply Balance

Finally, to the extent that the disc drive industry builds
    product based on expectations of demand that do not materialize,
    the distribution channel may experience an oversupply of
    products that could lead to increased price erosion. The
    industry, excluding Seagate, exited the June 2007 quarter with
    what we believe to be less than five weeks of distribution
    inventory in the desktop channel, which is consistent with
    historical seasonal patterns.

Seagate
    Overview

We are the leader in the disc drive industry with products that
    address the enterprise, desktop, mobile computing and consumer
    electronics and branded solutions storage markets. The Seagate
    3.5-inch and 2.5-inch disc drive units used in our branded
    storage products are reported in the desktop and mobile market
    information, respectively. We maintain a highly integrated
    approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a
    significant portion of the components we view as critical to our
    products, such as read/write heads and recording media. We
    believe that our control of these key technologies, combined
    with our platform design and manufacturing, enable us to achieve
    product performance, time-to-market leadership and manufacturing
    flexibility, which allows us to respond to customers and market
    opportunities. Our technology ownership, combined with our



integrated design and manufacturing approach, have allowed us to
    effectively leverage our leadership in traditional computing to
    enter new markets with only incremental product development and
    manufacturing costs.

Maxtor
    acquisition

During fiscal year 2007, we completed our integration of Maxtor,
    including customer and product transitions where we replaced
    Maxtor designed disc drive products with Seagate designed disc
    drive products, allowing us to improve our capacity utilization
    and further lower our cost structure. We achieved our goals of
    retaining a substantial portion of the market share held by
    Maxtor prior to the acquisition. We also continued to advance
    what we believe to be our technology and cost leadership
    positions, maintaining our position in key markets and
    introducing new products in core markets while developing
    additional value streams in new and emerging markets.

Our fiscal year 2007 included Maxtor’s operating losses
    largely recognized during the first half of the fiscal year as
    we transitioned Maxtor products to Seagate products and
    acquisition and integration related charges recognized over the
    entire fiscal year. Although we substantially completed the
    Maxtor restructuring and integration activities during the
    December 2006 quarter, certain operating expenses and
    acquisition related charges continued during the last half of
    the fiscal year, the most significant of which related to the
    amortization of acquired intangible assets. We expect to
    continue to incur charges, the most significant of which are
    expected to be the amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Operating
    performance

•

Revenue —

Revenue in fiscal year 2007 was
    approximately $11.4 billion, an increase of 23% over fiscal
    year 2006, mainly from an increase of 34% in the number of disc
    drives shipped as a result of the retention of a portion of
    Maxtor’s market share, but also due to continued growth in
    digital content and the resulting increase in demand for storage
    and growth in the mobile market, coupled with customer
    acceptance of our new products, including growth in branded
    storage products shipped to retail customers. The increase in
    the number of units shipped was off-set by price erosion which
    was particularly pronounced in the first half of fiscal year
    2007 in the desktop and mobile markets, in part as market share
    gains became the primary focus of a number of our competitors
    after our acquisition of Maxtor in late fiscal year 2006, as
    well as during the last half of the fiscal year, where the
    pricing environment for high capacity 3.5-inch ATA disc drives
    was more aggressive than we anticipated and where price erosion
    in the mobile market continued to be aggressive.

•

Enterprise

— We believe we increased our
    leadership position in the enterprise market,
    shipping16.7 million units during fiscal year 2007, an
    increase of 17% from 14.3 million units in fiscal year
    2006. During the June 2007 quarter, we shipped 4.3 million
    disc drives, an increase of 2% from the year-ago quarter and an
    increase of 3% from the immediately preceding quarter. Increases
    in unit shipments compared to the year-ago quarter were driven
    by our retention of Maxtor market share and an accelerating
    trend in both the adoption of small form factor products as well
    as high-capacity products for Internet infrastructure
    applications.

•

Mobile —

In fiscal year 2007, we believe the
    overall mobile compute market grew 35% from fiscal year 2006,
    with Seagate shipping 19.4 million units, an increase of
    56% over fiscal year 2006. During the June 2007 quarter, we
    shipped 6.1 million disc drives, an increase of 80% from
    the year-ago quarter and an increase of 30% from the immediately
    preceding quarter. We believe our share of the mobile compute
    market increased during the fiscal year and particularly during
    the June 2007 quarter, largely as a result of greater market
    access through additional qualifications of our mobile compute
    products and use of our mobile products in branded storage
    products. There was also a strong trend toward higher capacity
    products.

•

Desktop

— In fiscal year 2007, we believe we
    maintained our market leadership position with shipments of
    97.8 million units, an increase of 33% over fiscal year
    2006. During the June 2007 quarter, we shipped 23.8 million
    units, an increase of 19% from the year-ago quarter and
    essentially flat from the immediately preceding quarter. The
    increase from the year-ago quarter was mainly driven by our
    retention of Maxtor market share, the continued growth in
    digital content and the resulting increase in overall demand for
    desktop storage products and the use of our desktop disc drives
    in our branded storage products. In the global



distribution channel, we exited the June 2007 quarter with
    distribution channel inventory for desktop products at less than
    five weeks.

•

Consumer

— In fiscal year 2007, we shipped a
    total of 25.3 million disc drives in the consumer
    electronics (CE) market, an increase of 40% from fiscal year
    2006. During the June 2007 quarter, we shipped 5.0 million
    disc drives driven primarily by shipments into gaming
    applications and DVRs. This represents a 16% and 26% decrease
    from the year-ago quarter and immediately preceding quarter,
    respectively. The decrease from the immediately preceding
    quarter is mainly due to lower shipments into the DVR and gaming
    portions of the CE market. The decrease from the year-ago
    quarter was mainly driven by a significant reduction in the
    number of disc drives shipping into handheld applications and a
    reduction in gaming shipments, partially off-set by an increased
    demand in the DVR portion of the CE market.

Other factors affecting income —

In fiscal year
    2007, our operating results were favorably impacted by the
    elimination of variable performance-based compensation compared
    to an expense of $163 million recorded in fiscal year 2006.
    We expect that we will incur expenses related to variable
    performance-based compensation in fiscal year 2008. Our
    operating results were also favorably impacted by a
    $359 million tax adjustment that reflected a change to our
    valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (see Note 4 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report).
    Additionally, the proceeds of our $1.5 billion in new
    long-term debt was used to retire our 8% Senior Notes
    previously due 2009 (“8% Notes”) and to buy back
    shares of our common stock, thereby decreasing our outstanding
    common shares by over 40 million shares. Interest expense
    in fiscal year 2007, excluding $19 million in expenses
    related to the retirement of the 8% Notes, was
    approximately $80 million more than in fiscal year 2006
    because of additional interest expense related to the
    $1.5 billion in new long-term debt and because the debt
    assumed from the Maxtor acquisition represented less than two
    months of interest in fiscal year 2006. Interest expense, based
    on the debt outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2007, will be
    over $30 million per quarter in fiscal year 2008.

Seasonality

Historically, we have exhibited seasonally lower unit demand
    during the second half of each fiscal year, however, there were
    some recent quarters in fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006 in
    which these seasonal trends were moderated. We saw a return to
    traditional seasonality in fiscal year 2007. For the September
    2007 quarter, we expect to see demand in the desktop, mobile and
    consumer electronics markets to be seasonally higher than the
    June 2007 quarter, while we expect demand in the enterprise
    market to be flat to slightly up compared to the June 2007
    quarter.

Recording
    Media

The percentage of our requirements for recording media that we
    produce internally varies from quarter to quarter. We are
    continuing to expand our media production facilities in
    Singapore, and have relocated certain of the acquired Maxtor
    media manufacturing equipment to Asia. We do not expect our new
    media facility in Singapore to be fully operational until
    towards the end of fiscal year 2008. Our long-term strategy is
    to externally purchase no more than 15% of total recording media
    requirements.

We purchase approximately 70% of our aluminum substrates for
    recording media production from third parties. We are in the
    process of adding an aluminum substrate manufacturing facility
    in Johor, Malaysia which will allow us to decrease our purchases
    of aluminum substrates from third parties. We also purchase all
    of our glass substrates from third parties (mainly in Japan),
    which are used to manufacture our disc drives for mobile and
    small form factor consumer electronics products.

Recently, substantially all of our purchases of recording media
    and a significant portion of our aluminum substrates from
    third-party suppliers have been sourced from Komag, which is in
    the process of being acquired by Western Digital. We are engaged
    in discussions with other suppliers to ensure supply continuity
    should Komag decrease its supply to us after the closing of the
    acquisition by Western Digital.



Raw
    Materials

We believe Seagate is leading the transition to perpendicular
    recording technology. We are currently shipping perpendicular
    technology based products for all four major markets, and during
    the June 2007 quarter, we shipped over 28 million disc
    drives that use perpendicular recording technology compared to
    17 million disc drives shipped in the immediately preceding
    quarter. We expect that by the end of fiscal year 2008, all of
    our drive shipments will utilize perpendicular recording
    technology. Our products based on perpendicular technology
    require increased quantities of precious metals like ruthenium,
    which has led to an increase (that is likely to continue) in the
    inventory levels for these raw materials. The price of ruthenium
    has increased significantly over the last year and may continue
    to be volatile. In addition, ruthenium has at times been
    difficult to acquire. We believe we have adequate supply plans
    in place to support our expected perpendicular product ramp
    requirements.

Investments

In fiscal year 2007, we made $906 million of capital
    investments, $218 million of which occurred in the June
    2007 quarter. For fiscal year 2008, we expect approximately
    $900 million in capital investment will be required to
    continue to proceed with our planned media and substrate
    capacity expansions in Asia and to align capacity additions with
    current levels of customer demand, while we continue to improve
    our utilization of capital equipment.

In January 2007, we completed our acquisition of EVault in an
    all cash transaction valued at approximately $186 million,
    which includes approximately $2 million in acquisition
    costs as part of our effort to extend our storage solutions
    offerings.

Fiscal
    Year 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year 2006

The fiscal year 2007 results include the results of Maxtor for
    the entire year, while fiscal year 2006 include the results of
    Maxtor from May 19, 2006 to June 30, 2006. In
    connection with the Maxtor acquisition, we incurred a number of
    accounting charges and other costs, which impacted our earnings
    for the entire fiscal year 2007 and during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal year 2006.

Revenue.

Revenue for fiscal year 2007 was
    approximately $11.4 billion, up 23% from approximately
    $9.2 billion in fiscal year 2006. The increase in revenue
    from fiscal year 2006 was driven by a 34% increase in the unit
    volume of disc drives shipped from 118.7 million units to
    159.2 million units principally as a result of the
    retention of a portion of Maxtor’s market share, offset by
    a 9% reduction in our average sales price from $78 to $71 per
    unit and a weaker than anticipated demand for large capacity
    3.5-inch ATA disc drives. The comparative decrease in average
    sales price per unit in the period resulted from price erosion
    that more than offset improved product mix.

Unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2007 were as
    follows:

•

Enterprise

— 16.7 million, up from
    14.3 million units in fiscal year 2006.

•

Mobile —

19.4 million, up from
    12.5 million units in fiscal year 2006.

•

Desktop

— 97.8 million, up from
    73.8 million units in fiscal year 2006.

•

Consumer

— 25.3 million, up from
    18.1 million units in fiscal year 2006.

We maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer
    demand. We exercise judgment in formulating the underlying
    estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels,
    sales program participation and customer claims submittals in
    determining the provision for such programs. During fiscal year
    2007, sales programs recorded as contra revenue, were
    approximately 9% of our gross revenue, compared to 7% of our
    gross revenue for fiscal year 2006. The increase in sales
    programs as a percentage of gross revenue from fiscal year 2006
    was primarily the result of a higher mix of sales to
    distributors and retail customers which generally require higher
    program support than OEM sales and to a more aggressive pricing
    environment. Point-of-sale rebates, sales price adjustments and
    price protection accounted for a substantial portion of the
    increase in sales programs.

Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue for fiscal
    year 2007 was approximately $9.2 billion, up 30% from
    approximately $7.1 billion in fiscal year 2006, principally
    as a result of the acquisition of Maxtor. Gross margin as a
    percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2007 was 19% as compared
    with 23% for fiscal year 2006.



The gross margin percentage decrease from fiscal year 2006 was
    due to the sale of lower margin Maxtor designed products during
    the first six months of fiscal year 2007; costs and charges
    related to our acquisition of Maxtor during fiscal year 2007
    (including integration and retention costs of $54 million,
    stock-based compensation of $27 million, amortization of
    existing technology of $150 million, and an
    $18 million accrual for the settlement of customer
    compensatory claims associated with quality issues related to
    legacy Maxtor products shipped prior to the closing of the
    Maxtor acquisition); and an aggressive pricing environment in
    fiscal year 2007, particularly in the high capacity 3.5-inch and
    mobile markets in the first half of the year, and the low end
    OEM desktop and mobile markets in the second half. These effects
    were partially offset by the elimination of variable
    performance-based compensation for fiscal year 2007, compared to
    an expense of $76 million recorded in Cost of revenue in
    fiscal year 2006.

Product Development Expense.

Product
    development expense increased by $99 million, or 12%, for
    fiscal year 2007 when compared with fiscal year 2006. The
    increase in product development expense from fiscal year 2006
    was primarily due to increases of $115 million in salaries
    and benefits resulting from increased staffing levels due in
    part to the retention of certain Maxtor employees, and
    $10 million in stock-based compensation related to the
    Maxtor acquisition, $7 million in non-Maxtor stock-based
    compensation and $4 million in the write-off of

in-process

research and development related to our acquisition of EVault,
    partially offset by the elimination of variable
    performance-based compensation for fiscal year 2007, compared to
    an expense of $46 million in fiscal year 2006.

Marketing and Administrative
    Expense.

Marketing and administrative expense
    increased by $142 million, or 32%, for fiscal year 2007
    when compared with fiscal year 2006. The increase in marketing
    and administrative expense from fiscal year 2006 was primarily
    due to the recording in our first quarter of a $40 million
    increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable
    related to eSys Technologies Pte. Ltd. and its related affiliate
    entities (“eSys”), previously our largest distributor,
    an increase of $86 million in salaries and benefits
    resulting from increased staffing levels due in part to the
    retention of certain Maxtor employees, an increase of
    $5 million in integration and retention costs related to
    the Maxtor acquisition, an increase of $11 million in
    advertising expense and an increase of $11 million in
    non-Maxtor stock-based compensation. These increases were
    partially offset by the elimination of variable
    performance-based compensation for fiscal year 2007, compared to
    an expense of $41 million in fiscal year 2006.

Amortization of Intangibles.

Amortization of
    intangibles increased by $42 million primarily due to the
    amortization of intangibles acquired in the Maxtor and EVault
    acquisitions.

Restructuring and Other.

During fiscal year
    2007, we recorded restructuring costs of approximately
    $33 million in connection with our ongoing restructuring
    activities. These costs were primarily a result of a
    restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of our
    global workforce with existing and anticipated business
    requirements, primarily in our U.S. and Far East operations
    and asset impairments. The restructuring costs were comprised of
    employee termination costs of approximately $14 million
    relating to a reduction in our workforce, approximately
    $11 million in charges related to impaired facility
    improvements and equipment as a result of the alignment plan,
    and approximately $8 million in charges related to impaired
    other intangibles. These restructuring activities are expected
    to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008. Additionally, we
    reversed $4 million of restructuring accruals relating to
    the sale of a surplus building impaired in a prior restructuring.

Net Other Income (Expense).

Net other income
    changed by $103 million from net other income of
    $50 million in fiscal year 2006 to net other expense of
    $53 million in fiscal year 2007. The change from fiscal
    year 2006 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense
    of $81 million related to our new $1.5 billion
    long-term debt issued in September 2006, as well as debt
    acquired in the Maxtor acquisition, and expenses of
    $19 million incurred in October 2006 related to the early
    retirement of our 8% Notes. The $1.5 billion in new
    long-term debt was used to retire the 8% Notes and to buy
    back shares of our common stock. Interest expense in fiscal year
    2007, excluding the expenses related to the early retirement of
    the 8% Notes, was approximately $80 million more than
    in fiscal year 2006 because of additional interest expense
    related to the $1.5 billion in new long-term debt and
    because the debt assumed from the Maxtor acquisition represented
    less than two months of interest in fiscal year 2006.

Income Taxes.

We recorded a benefit from
    income taxes of $352 million for the fiscal year ended
    June 29, 2007 compared to a provision for income taxes of
    $84 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.
    We are a foreign holding company incorporated in the Cayman
    Islands with foreign and U.S. subsidiaries that operate in
    multiple taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our worldwide
    operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or



is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs
    we operate under in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland and
    Thailand. These tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to
    expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020. Our
    provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended
    June 29, 2007 differs from the provision for income taxes
    that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate
    to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of
    (i) a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain
    deferred tax assets and (ii) the tax benefit related to the
    aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs. Our
    provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended
    June 30, 2006 differed from the provision for income taxes
    that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate
    to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of
    (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax
    holidays and tax incentive programs, (ii) an increase in
    our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, and
    (iii) utilization of research tax credits generated in the
    current year.

Based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to
    (i) potential future increases in our valuation allowance
    for deferred tax assets and (ii) limitations imposed by
    Internal Revenue Code Section 382
    (“IRC Section 382”) on usage of certain tax
    attributes (further described below), we anticipate that our
    effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than
    the U.S. federal statutory rate. Dividend distributions
    received from our U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to
    U.S. withholding taxes when and if distributed. Deferred
    tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of
    certain foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be
    subject to tax in the Cayman Islands or U.S. federal income
    tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company.

During fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, we reduced our
    valuation allowance recorded in prior years for our deferred tax
    assets by $641 million. This release of valuation allowance
    was largely due to the completion during fiscal 2007 of the
    restructuring of our intercompany arrangements, which enabled us
    to forecast our U.S. profits with greater certainty and the
    recording of a U.S. taxable gain in connection with the
    intercompany sale of certain Maxtor intangible assets as
    described below. As a result of the valuation allowance release,
    we recorded a U.S. deferred tax benefit of
    $319 million and a $322 million reduction in the
    goodwill originally recorded in connection with the Maxtor
    acquisition. The reduction in goodwill was required in
    accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Statement (“SFAS”) No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“SFAS No. 109”) as a result of the
    reversal of valuation allowance that had been previously
    recorded as of the date of acquisition against Maxtor related
    deferred tax assets primarily for tax net operating loss
    carryovers. The valuation allowance was reduced primarily to
    reflect the realization of acquired Maxtor net operating loss
    carryforwards due to increased forecasts of future
    U.S. taxable income and a $296 million gain for
    U.S. tax purposes from the intercompany sale of certain
    intellectual property rights to a foreign subsidiary.
    Approximately $120 million of tax expense associated with
    the gain on the intercompany sale of intangibles has been
    capitalized in accordance with Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

(“ARB No. 51”) and is being amortized to
    income tax expense over a sixty-month period, which approximates
    the expected useful life of the intangibles sold in the
    intercompany transaction.

As of June 29, 2007, we recorded net deferred tax assets of
    $768 million, the realization of $663 million of which
    is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient
    taxable income in future periods. Although realization is not
    assured, we believe that it is more likely than not that these
    deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax
    assets considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease
    in subsequent quarters, when we reevaluate our estimates of
    future taxable income.

As a result of the Maxtor acquisition, Maxtor underwent a change
    in ownership within the meaning of IRC Section 382 on
    May 19, 2006. In general, IRC Section 382 places
    annual limitations on the use of certain tax attributes such as
    net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at
    the ownership change date. As of June 29, 2007,
    $1.4 billion and $337 million of U.S. federal and
    state net operating losses, respectively, and $47 million
    of tax credit carryovers acquired from Maxtor are generally
    subject to an annual limitation of approximately
    $110 million. Certain amounts may be accelerated into the
    first five years following the acquisition pursuant to IRC
    Section 382 and published notices.

On January 3, 2005, we underwent a change in ownership
    under IRC Section 382 due to the sale of common shares to
    the public by our then largest shareholder, New SAC. Based on an
    independent valuation as of January 3, 2005, the annual
    limitation for this change is $44.8 million. As of
    June 29, 2007, there were $447 million of
    U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and $111 million
    of U.S. tax credit carryforwards subject to IRC
    Section 382



limitation associated with the January 3, 2005 change. To
    the extent we believe it is more likely than not that the
    deferred tax assets associated with tax attributes subject to
    this IRC Section 382 limitation will not be realized, a
    valuation allowance has been provided.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently
    examining our federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending
    in 2001 through 2004. The timing of the settlement of these
    examinations is uncertain. We believe that adequate amounts of
    tax have been provided for any final assessments that may result.

Fiscal
    Year 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year 2005

The fiscal year 2006 results include the results of Maxtor for
    the six weeks from the closing date of the acquisition of
    May 19, 2006 through June 30, 2006. In connection with
    the Maxtor acquisition, we incurred a number of accounting
    charges and other costs, which impacted our earnings for the
    last quarter of and the entire fiscal year 2006.

Revenue.

Revenue for fiscal year 2006 was
    approximately $9.2 billion, up 22% from approximately
    $7.6 billion in fiscal year 2005. The increase in revenue
    was primarily due to record disc drive shipments of
    118.7 million units in fiscal year 2006 compared to
    98.1 million units in fiscal year 2005, as well as an
    improved product mix of our new products, offset by price
    erosion. Our overall average sales price per unit (ASP) for our
    products was $78 for fiscal year 2006, up from $77 in fiscal
    year 2005.

Unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2006 were as
    follows:

•

Consumer

— 18.1 million, up from
    16.7 million units in fiscal year 2005.

•

Mobile —

12.5 million, up from
    5.7 million units in fiscal year 2005.

•

Enterprise

— 14.3 million, up from
    13.5 million units in fiscal year 2005.

•

Desktop

— 73.8 million, up from
    62.2 million units in fiscal year 2005.

We maintained various sales programs aimed at increasing
    customer demand. We exercise judgment in formulating the
    underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels,
    sales program participation and customer claims submittals in
    determining the provision for such programs. During fiscal year
    2006, sales programs recorded as contra revenue were
    approximately 7% of our gross revenue, compared to 5% of our
    gross revenue for fiscal year 2005. The increase in sales
    programs as a percentage of gross revenue was primarily the
    result of higher price erosion in the distribution channel and
    growth in retail sales, which typically require higher
    point-of-sale rebates.

Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue for fiscal
    year 2006 was approximately $7.1 billion, up 20% from
    approximately $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2005. Gross
    margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2006 was 23%
    as compared with 22% for fiscal year 2005. The increase in gross
    margin as a percentage of revenue from fiscal year 2005 was
    primarily due to higher overall unit shipments and an increase
    mix of new higher-margin products partially offset by higher
    costs associated with new product transitions, increased
    warranty cost and customer service inventory write-downs,
    stock-based compensation costs, price erosion, and in connection
    with the Maxtor acquisition, an increasingly under-utilized
    manufacturing infrastructure required to build Maxtor-designed
    disc drive products and purchase accounting related costs
    including integration and retention costs, stock-based
    compensation and amortization of existing technology.

Product Development Expense.

Product
    development expense increased by $160 million, or 25%, for
    fiscal year 2006 when compared with fiscal year 2005. The
    increase in product development expense from fiscal year 2005
    was primarily due to increases of $65 million in salaries
    resulting and benefits from increased staffing levels and
    variable performance-based compensation, $38 million in
    product development support costs, $24 million in
    stock-based compensation and $28 million in costs related
    to the Maxtor acquisition, including integration and retention
    costs and stock-based compensation.

Marketing and Administrative
    Expense.

Marketing and administrative expense
    increased by $141 million, or 46%, for fiscal year 2006
    when compared with fiscal year 2005. The increase in marketing
    and administrative expense from fiscal year 2005 was primarily
    due to increases of $54 million in salaries and benefits
    resulting from



increased staffing levels and variable performance-based
    compensation, $24 million in stock-based compensation,
    $13 million in advertising and promotion, and
    $18 million in costs related to the Maxtor acquisition,
    including integration and retention costs and stock-based
    compensation.

Amortization of Intangibles.

Amortization of
    intangibles increased by $7 million due to intangibles
    acquired in the Maxtor acquisition.

Restructuring.

During fiscal year 2006, we
    recorded restructuring costs of approximately $4 million in
    connection with our ongoing restructuring activities. These
    costs were related to a restructuring plan established to
    continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and
    anticipated business requirements in our Far East operations.
    The restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination
    costs relating to a continuing effort to optimize our production
    around the world. We have substantially completed these
    restructuring activities.

In connection with the Maxtor acquisition, we accrued certain
    exit costs aggregating $251 million, all of which increased
    goodwill and did not impact our operating results. See
    Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    elsewhere in this report.

Net Other Income (Expense).

Net other income
    increased by $40 million for fiscal year 2006 when compared
    with fiscal year 2005. The change from fiscal year 2005 was
    primarily due to an increase in interest income of
    $33 million resulting from higher average interest rates
    and higher average balances in our interest bearing accounts and
    a decrease in interest expense of $7 million resulting from
    the pay off of a term loan in fiscal year 2006.

Income Taxes.

We recorded a provision for
    income taxes of $84 million for the fiscal year ended
    June 30, 2006 compared to a provision for income taxes of
    $25 million for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2005. We
    are a foreign holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands
    with foreign and U.S. subsidiaries that operate in multiple
    taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our worldwide operating
    income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt
    from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we
    operate under in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland and
    Thailand. These tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to
    expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2015. Our
    provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended
    June 30, 2006 differed from the provision for income taxes
    that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate
    to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of
    (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax
    holidays and tax incentive programs, (ii) an increase in
    our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, and
    (iii) utilization of research tax credits generated in the
    current year. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year
    ended July 1, 2005 differed from the provision for income
    taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35%
    rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net
    effect of (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned
    tax holidays and tax incentive programs, (ii) an increase
    in our valuation allowance for certain foreign deferred income
    tax assets, (iii) a tax benefit related to a reduction in
    previously accrued foreign income taxes, and
    (iv) utilization of research tax credits generated in that
    year. Based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to
    (i) potential future increases in our valuation allowance
    for deferred tax assets, (ii) limitations imposed by
    Internal Revenue Code Section 382 on usage of certain tax
    attributes (further described below), and (iii) use of tax
    attributes acquired from Maxtor and other acquisitions for which
    a valuation allowance has initially been recognized that, if
    reversed, will be reversed to goodwill, we anticipate that our
    effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than
    the U.S. federal statutory rate. Dividend distributions
    received from our U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to
    U.S. withholding taxes when and if distributed. Deferred
    tax liabilities were not recorded on unremitted earnings of
    certain foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be
    subject to tax in the Cayman Islands or U.S. federal income
    tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company.

As of June 30, 2006, we had recorded net deferred tax
    assets of $78 million, the realization of which was
    primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient
    taxable income in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Although
    realization is not assured, we believe that it is more likely
    than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The
    amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however,
    may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters, when we
    reevaluate our estimates of future taxable income.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following is a discussion of our principal liquidity
    requirements and capital resources.



We had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents
    and short-term investments at June 29, 2007, which includes
    $988 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash
    equivalents increased by $78 million during fiscal year
    2007. This increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal
    year 2007 was primarily attributable to net proceeds received
    from the issuance of long-term debt totaling approximately
    $1.5 billion, cash provided by operating activities and
    maturities and sales of short-term investments in excess of
    purchases of short-term investments, substantially offset by
    capital expenditures, the redemption of our 8% Notes, the
    repurchase of our common shares and the acquisition of EVault.

In September 2006, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings
    (“HDD”), our wholly-owned direct subsidiary issued
    senior notes totaling $1.5 billion comprised of
    $300 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate
    Senior Notes due October 2009 (the “2009 Notes”),
    $600 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.375% Senior Notes due October 2011 (the “2011
    Notes”) and $600 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.800% Senior Notes due October 2016 (the “2016
    Notes”). The notes are guaranteed by Seagate Technology on
    a full and unconditional basis.

Until required for other purposes, our cash and cash equivalents
    are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining
    maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our
    short-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable
    debt securities with remaining maturities of more than
    90 days at the time of purchase.

Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2007 was
    approximately $943 million and consisted primarily of net
    income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation,
    amortization, stock-based compensation and tax benefits related
    to a change in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,
    combined with a decrease in accounts payable, variable
    performance-based compensation earned during fiscal year 2006
    and paid in fiscal year 2007 and the payment of accrued exit
    costs and retention bonuses related to the Maxtor acquisition,
    partially offset by a reduction in inventories.

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2006 was
    approximately $1.5 billion and consisted primarily of net
    income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation,
    amortization and stock-based compensation, combined with an
    increase in accounts receivable and inventories, partially
    offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2005 was
    approximately $1.4 billion and consisted primarily of net
    income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and
    amortization, combined with an increase in accounts payable and
    accrued expenses offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

Cash
    Used in Investing Activities

During fiscal year 2007, we used $402 million for net cash
    investing activities, which was primarily attributable to
    expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements
    of approximately $906 million and $178 million (net of
    cash acquired) for the acquisition of EVault, partially offset
    by $675 million of maturities and sales of short-term
    investments in excess of purchases of short-term investments.
    The approximately $906 million we invested in property,
    equipment and leasehold improvements was comprised of:

•

$219 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment
    related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and
    test facilities in the United States and the Far East;

•

$418 million to upgrade the capabilities of our thin-film
    media operations in the United States, Singapore and Northern
    Ireland;

•

$240 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for
    our recording head operations in the United States, the Far East
    and Northern Ireland; and

•

$29 million for other capital additions.

Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
    $561 million for fiscal year 2006 and was primarily
    attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and
    leasehold improvements partially offset by the maturities



and sales of short-term investments in excess of purchases
    thereof as well as net cash acquired from Maxtor. Specifically,
    during fiscal year 2006, we invested approximately
    $1.0 billion in property, equipment and leasehold
    improvements comprised of:

•

$336 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment
    related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and
    test facilities in the United States and the Far East;

•

$349 million to upgrade the capabilities of our thin-film
    media operations in the United States, Singapore and Northern
    Ireland;

•

$276 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for
    our recording head operations in the United States, the Far East
    and Northern Ireland; and

•

$47 million for other capital additions.

Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
    $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2005 and was primarily
    attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and
    leasehold improvements and the purchases of short-term
    investments in excess of maturities and sales thereof.

The increase in the investment in property, equipment and
    leasehold improvements during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 as
    compared with fiscal year 2005 was for increased capacity to
    support increased unit shipments and additional capacity for the

ramp-up

and
    production of Seagate-designed disc drive products to replace
    legacy Maxtor-designed products. For fiscal year 2008, we expect
    approximately $900 million in capital investment will be
    required to continue to proceed with our planned media and
    substrate capacity expansions in Asia and to align capacity
    additions with current levels of customer demand, while we
    continue to improve our utilization of capital equipment.

Cash
    Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities of $463 million for
    fiscal year 2007 was primarily attributable to approximately
    $1.5 billion used for the repurchases of our common shares,
    $416 million used in the redemption of our 8% Notes
    and $212 million of dividends paid to our shareholders,
    largely offset by approximately $1.5 billion received from
    the issuance of long-term debt and $219 million cash
    provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock
    purchases.

Net cash used in financing activities of $732 million for
    fiscal year 2006 was primarily attributable to $399 million
    used in the repurchases of common shares, the repayment of a
    $340 million term loan and $155 million of dividends
    paid to our shareholders, partially offset by $118 million
    cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee
    stock purchases.

Net cash used in financing activities of $35 million for
    fiscal year 2005 was primarily attributable to dividends of
    $122 million paid to our shareholders and principal
    payments on our senior secured credit facilities offset by
    $90 million in cash provided by employee stock option
    exercises and employee stock purchases.

Liquidity
    Sources and Cash Requirements and Commitments

Our principal sources of liquidity as of June 29, 2007,
    consisted of: (1) approximately $1.1 billion in cash,
    cash equivalents, and short-term investments, (2) cash we
    expect to generate from operations and (3) a
    $500 million revolving credit facility.

Our $500 million revolving credit facility matures in
    September 2011. The $500 million revolving facility, which
    we entered into in September 2006, replaced our previous
    $100 million revolving credit facility. The
    $500 million revolving credit facility is available for
    cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to
    a sub-limit of $100 million. Although no borrowings have
    been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date, we had
    utilized $47 million for outstanding letters of credit and
    bankers’ guarantees as of June 29, 2007, leaving
    $453 million for additional borrowings, subject to
    compliance with financial covenants and other customary
    conditions to borrowing.



The credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility
    contains covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in
    compliance with the agreement. This credit agreement contains
    three financial covenants: (1) minimum cash, cash
    equivalents and marketable securities; (2) a fixed charge
    coverage ratio; and (3) a net leverage ratio. As of
    June 29, 2007, we are in compliance with all covenants,
    including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain.

In October 2006, we used $416 million of the net proceeds
    from the September 2006 issuance of $1.5 billion debt to
    redeem the $400 million principal amount of our
    8% Notes and pay a $16 million redemption premium.

Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our
    working capital, research and development, capital expenditure
    needs, and to service our debt. In addition, since the second
    half of fiscal year 2002 and through the June 2007 quarter, we
    have paid dividends to our shareholders.

On September 1, 2006, November 17, 2006,
    February 16, 2007 and May 18, 2007, we paid dividends
    aggregating approximately $212 million, or $0.38 per share,
    to our common shareholders of record as of August 18, 2006,
    November 3, 2006, February 2, 2007 and May 4,
    2007. On July 19, 2007, we declared a quarterly dividend of
    $0.10 per share that will be paid on or before August 17,
    2007 to our common shareholders of record as of August 3,
    2007. In deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends,
    our directors will take into account such factors as general
    business conditions within the disc drive industry, our
    financial results, our capital requirements, contractual and
    legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our
    subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, the impact of
    paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as
    our board of directors may deem relevant.

Because we had current earnings and profits in excess of
    distributions for our taxable year ended June 29, 2007,
    distributions on our common shares to U.S. shareholders
    during this period were treated as dividend income for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes. We anticipate that we
    will have earnings and profits in excess of distributions in
    fiscal year 2008. Therefore, distributions to
    U.S. shareholders in fiscal year 2008 are anticipated to be
    treated as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax
    purposes.

Non-U.S. shareholders

should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax
    treatment.

As a result of the acquisition of Maxtor, we assumed all of
    Maxtor’s outstanding debts, including, without limitation,
    its outstanding convertible senior notes. Maxtor’s
    2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due August 2012 (the
    “2.375% Notes), of which $326 million were
    outstanding as of June 29, 2007, contain a cash conversion
    feature that will require Seagate to deliver the holders, upon
    any conversion of these notes, cash in an amount equal to the
    lesser of (a) the principal amount of the notes converted
    and (b) the as-converted value of the notes. To the extent
    holders of the Maxtor notes choose to convert their notes,
    Seagate will require additional amounts of cash to meet this
    obligation. The payment of dividends to holders of our common
    shares may in certain future quarters result in upward
    adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2.375% Notes.

On January 26, 2007, we completed our acquisition of
    EVault, a privately held provider of online backup services in
    an all cash transaction valued at approximately
    $178 million (net of cash acquired).

On August 8, 2006, we announced that our board of directors
    had authorized the use of up to $2.5 billion for the
    repurchase of our outstanding common shares over a two-year
    period. From the authorization of this repurchase program and
    through the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, we repurchased
    approximately 62.0 million shares at an average price of
    $24.62, all of which were considered cancelled and are no longer
    outstanding. We repurchased these shares through a combination
    of open market purchases and prepaid forward agreements with
    large financial institutions, according to which we prepaid the
    financial institutions a fixed amount to deliver a variable
    number of shares at future dates. We entered into these
    agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at
    a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price
    (“VWAP”) of our common shares. Our policy to date has
    been to enter into such transactions only when the discount that
    we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash
    prepayment to the financial institution. There were no explicit
    commissions or fees on these prepaid forward agreements. Under
    the terms of these agreements, there was no requirement for the
    financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment
    to us. These prepaid forward agreements were not derivatives
    because the Company had prepaid all amounts and had no remaining
    obligation. The agreements do not contain an embedded
    derivative. The prepayments were recorded as a reduction to
    shareholders’ equity when paid and the shares were



deducted from shares outstanding. The agreements require the
    physical delivery of shares; there were no settlement
    alternatives, except in the case of certain defined
    extraordinary events which are outside the control of Seagate
    and the financial institutions. The parameters used to calculate
    the final number of shares deliverable are the total notional
    amount of the contract and the average VWAP of our common shares
    during the contract period less the agreed upon discount. The
    contracts are indexed solely to the price of Seagate’s
    common shares.

During fiscal year 2007, we repurchased 24.3 million shares
    through open market repurchases. In addition, we made payments
    totaling $950 million under prepaid forward agreements and
    took delivery of 37.7 million shares using prepaid forward
    agreements. Shares physically delivered to us were cancelled and
    are no longer outstanding. At June 29, 2007, there were no
    outstanding prepaid forward agreements to repurchase our common
    shares.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we repurchased
    16.7 million shares under a previously authorized stock
    repurchase program. The program authorizing repurchases in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 was completed and there is no
    outstanding authority for further shares to be purchased under
    that program.

In addition, as part of our strategy, we may selectively pursue
    strategic alliances, acquisitions and investments that are
    complementary to our business. Any material future acquisitions,
    alliances or investments will likely require additional capital.
    We may enter into more of these types of arrangements in the
    future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or
    debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms
    favorable to us or at all. We will require substantial amounts
    of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on
    our indebtedness, future capital expenditures, any increased
    working capital requirements and share repurchases. If we are
    unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or
    cash flow from operations, we cannot assure you that we will be
    able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us,
    if at all.

We believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund
    our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the
    next 12 months. Our ability to fund these requirements and
    comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements
    will depend on our future operations, performance and cash flow
    and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial,
    business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As of June 29, 2007, we did not have any material
    off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in
    Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of

Regulation S-K).

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most
    critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the
    results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The
    SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the
    ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial
    condition and operating results, and require us to make our most
    difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the
    need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at
    the time of estimation. Based on this definition, our most
    critical policies include: establishment of sales program
    accruals, establishment of warranty accruals, valuation of
    deferred tax assets as well as the valuation of intangibles and
    goodwill. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as
    the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key
    accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to
    uncollectible customer accounts, valuation of inventory,
    valuation of share-based payments and acquisition related
    restructuring. We believe that these other accounting policies
    and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to
    make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as
    subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material
    impact on our reported results of operations for a given period.

Establishment of Sales Program Accruals.

We
    establish certain distributor and OEM sales programs aimed at
    increasing customer demand. For the distribution channel, these
    programs typically involve rebates related to a
    distributor’s level of sales, order size, advertising or
    point of sale activity and price protection adjustments. For OEM
    sales, rebates are typically based on an OEM customer’s
    volume of purchases from Seagate or other agreed upon rebate
    programs. We provide for these obligations at the time that
    revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements. We estimate
    these contra-revenue rebates and adjustments based on various
    factors, including price reductions during the period reported,
    estimated future price erosion, customer orders, distributor
    sell-through and inventory levels, program participation,
    customer claim submittals and sales returns. Our estimates
    reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating
    to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of
    program goals, and inventory and sell-through levels reported by
    our distribution customers.

While we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of
    the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate
    such rebates and adjustments, actual market conditions or
    customer behavior could differ from our expectations. As a
    result, actual payments under these programs, which may spread
    over several months after the related sale, may vary from the
    amount accrued. Accordingly, revenues and margins in the period
    in which the adjustment occurs may be affected. For example, if
    the pricing environment is more favorable than we anticipated,
    as it was in the quarter ended December 2006, accruals for
    forward price protection may be higher than needed. Conversely,
    in the more severely price-competitive second half of fiscal
    year 2007, utilization of special price adjustments was higher
    than expected. In addition, during periods in which our
    distributors’ inventories of our products are at higher
    than historical levels, our contra-revenue estimates are subject
    to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual
    results to vary is accordingly higher. Currently, our
    distributors’ inventories are within the historical range.

Significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which
    we base our contra-revenue estimates could have a material
    effect on our operating results. Since fiscal year 2005, total
    sales programs have ranged from 5% to 9% of gross revenues. Due
    to the competitive pricing environment in our industry, sales
    programs as a percentage of gross revenue may increase from the
    current range. If such rebates and incentives trend upwards,
    revenues and margins will be reduced. Adjustments to revenues
    due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to
    revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 0.3% of
    quarterly gross revenue throughout fiscal years 2006 and 2007.



In addition, our failure to accurately predict the level of
    future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a
    material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Establishment of Warranty Accruals.

We
    estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is
    recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of
    one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated
    product failure rates and trends (including the timing of
    product returns during the warranty periods), estimated repair
    or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer
    compensatory claims related to product quality issues, if any.
    We use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we
    exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying
    estimates. Should actual experience in any future period differ
    significantly from our estimates, or should the rate of future
    product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the
    past, our future results of operations could be materially
    affected. Our judgment is subject to a greater degree of
    subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products and
    legacy Maxtor designed products because of limited experience
    with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates.
    We continually introduce new products and have recently begun a
    shift to disc drive products that utilize perpendicular
    recording technology.

The actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if
    the actual rate of unit failure, the cost to repair a unit, or
    the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims
    are greater than that which we have used in estimating the
    warranty accrual. Since we typically outsource our warranty
    repairs, our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations
    with vendors and may vary from our estimates. We also exercise
    judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disc
    drives. To the extent such sales fall below our forecast,
    warranty cost will be adversely impacted.

Our warranty cost has ranged from approximately 2 to 3% of
    revenue over the last three years. We review our warranty
    accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and
    which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates
    underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that will
    impact the current period gross margins and income. Re-estimates
    of prior warranty accruals have been approximately 1% of revenue
    or less in fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007. Higher than
    anticipated failures of specific products (as we had in fiscal
    years 2004 and 2005) and significant increases in repair or
    replacement costs driven by reduced sales for refurbished
    products (as during the fiscal years 2006 and 2007) have
    historically been the major reasons for significant re-estimates.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.

The
    recording of our deferred tax assets each period depends
    primarily on our ability to generate current and future taxable
    income in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.
    Each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for
    our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so
    that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that
    we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax
    assets will be realized. Significant decreases in projections of
    taxable income, particularly in the United States, would likely
    result in significant increases in our valuation allowance which
    in turn could adversely impact our effective tax rate. With the
    acquisition of Maxtor, the realizability of U.S. deferred
    tax assets was determined on a consolidated return basis. As a
    result, Maxtor’s deferred tax assets that were determined
    to be realizable were recorded as a reduction of goodwill and
    Seagate deferred tax assets that were determined to be no longer
    realizable were written off with a charge to income tax expense
    at the date of acquisition.

Valuation of Intangible Assets and
    Goodwill.

In accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141”), the purchase price of
    an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired
    business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual
    of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. We engage
    third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining
    the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant
    judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to
    intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value
    based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable. These
    estimates are based on historical experience and information
    obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are
    inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of
    the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future
    expected cash flows from existing technology, customer
    relationships, trade names, and other intangible assets; the
    acquired company’s brand awareness and market position, as
    well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand
    will continue to be used in the combined company’s product
    portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and
    circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or
    validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.



We are required to periodically evaluate the carrying values of
    our intangible assets for impairment. If any of our intangible
    assets are determined to be impaired, we may have to write down
    the impaired asset and our earnings would be adversely impacted
    in the period that occurs.

At June 29, 2007, our goodwill totaled approximately
    $2.3 billion and our identifiable other intangible assets
    totaled $188 million. In accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS No. 142”), we assess the
    impairment of goodwill at least annually, or more often if
    warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that
    the carrying value may exceed its fair value. This assessment
    may require the projection and discounting of cash flows,
    analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair
    values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities.
    Estimates of cash flow are based upon, among other things,
    certain assumptions about expected future operating performance;
    judgment is also exercised in determining an appropriate
    discount rate. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ
    from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic
    conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in
    operating performance. Significant differences between these
    estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our
    future financial results.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(“SFAS No. 159”).
    SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure
    many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
    value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
    value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at
    each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently
    evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated results of
    operations and financial condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(“SFAS No. 158”). SFAS No. 158
    requires that the funded status of defined benefit
    postretirement plans be recognized on a company’s balance
    sheet, and changes in the funded status be reflected in
    comprehensive income, effective fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2006, which we adopted in our fiscal year
    ended June 29, 2007 and did not have a material impact on
    our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
    SFAS No. 158 also requires companies to measure the
    funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year-end,
    effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
    We expect to adopt the measurement provisions of
    SFAS No. 158 in our fiscal year 2010, effective
    June 30, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 to have a material impact on our
    consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”) which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other
    accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
    measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those
    accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant
    measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not
    require any new fair value measurements. However, for some
    entities, the application of this Statement will change current
    practice. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption
    of SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated results
    of operations and financial condition.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN No. 48”). This Interpretation
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109. This Interpretation
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This
    Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006 and will be adopted by us in the first
    quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the
    effect that the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on
    our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.



In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments

(“SFAS No. 155”), which amends
    SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”),
    and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS No. 140”). SFAS No. 155
    simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in
    other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for
    as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire
    instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also
    clarifies and amends certain other provisions of
    SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140.
    SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
    instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement
    event occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided
    the company has not yet issued financial statements, including
    for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We do not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or
    cash flows.

In July 2007, the FASB agreed to issue for comment a proposed
    FASB Staff Position (FSP) addressing convertible instruments
    that may be settled in cash upon conversion, including those
    that may require partial cash settlement. The proposed FSP would
    require the issuer to separately account for the liability and
    equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects
    the issuer’s economics interests. The proposed FSP would
    require bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification
    of that component in equity, with the accretion of the discount
    on the debt resulting in the “economic interest cost”
    being reflected in the statement of operations through higher
    interest expense. The proposed FSP if issued would be effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, and
    would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented
    pursuant to the guidance of SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

(“SFAS No. 154”). Our accounting for the
    2.375% Notes acquired from Maxtor and therefore our
    financial position and results of operations may be impacted by
    the proposed FSP. We will evaluate the impact of the final FSP
    on our financial position and results of operations when issued.

ITEM 7A.

QUALITATIVE
    AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market
    risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our
    investment portfolio and long-term debt. We currently do not use
    derivative financial instruments in either our investment
    portfolio or to hedge debt.

As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal
    loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested
    funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We mitigate
    default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in
    diversified, high-quality investment grade securities with
    limited time to maturity. We constantly monitor our investment
    portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to
    a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor
    or depository. We maintain a highly liquid portfolio by
    investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or
    resale markets.

We have both fixed and variable rate debt obligations. We enter
    into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes
    including capital expenditures and working capital needs. We
    currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge our
    interest rate exposure.

At June 29, 2007, we had $23 million in marketable
    securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss
    position for a period greater than twelve months. The unrealized
    loss on these marketable securities was immaterial.

The table below presents principal (or notional) amounts and
    related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for
    our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of
    June 29, 2007. All investments mature in three years or
    less. Included in long term debt for fiscal year 2008, is the
    principal amount of $326 million related to our
    2.375% Notes which is payable upon the conversion of the
    2.375% Notes, which are currently convertible as the
    Company’s share price was in excess of 110% of the
    conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading days during
    the last 30 trading days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year
    2007. Unless earlier converted, the 2.375% Notes must be
    redeemed in August 2012.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.

We transact
    business in various foreign countries. Our primary foreign
    currency cash flows are in countries where we have a
    manufacturing presence. We have established a foreign currency
    hedging program to protect against the increase in value of
    foreign currency cash flows resulting from operating and capital
    expenditures over the next year. We hedge portions of our
    forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with
    forward exchange contracts. When the U.S. dollar weakens
    significantly against the foreign currencies, the increase in
    the value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset
    by gains in the value of the forward contracts designated as
    hedges. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthens, the
    decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is
    offset by losses in the value of the forward contracts. These
    forward foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may
    have maturities of up to twelve months. Additionally, in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into forward
    contracts to hedge the capital expense costs associated with a
    new manufacturing facility under construction in Malaysia.

We evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and
    retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the
    hedging instruments in other income (expense) on the statement
    of operations. We did not have any net gains (losses) recognized
    in other income (expense) for cash flow hedges due to hedge
    ineffectiveness in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005.

As of June 29, 2007, our notional fair values of foreign
    exchange forward contracts totaled $148 million. We do not
    believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks,
    because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major
    financial institutions, and we manage the notional amount of
    contracts entered into with any one counterparty. We maintain
    limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating
    of the financial institutions. We do not enter derivative
    financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The
    table below provides information as of June 29, 2007 about
    our derivative financial instruments, comprised of foreign
    currency forward exchange contracts. The table is provided in
    U.S. dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional
    amounts (at the contract exchange rates) and the weighted
    average contractual foreign currency exchange rates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

— Seagate Technology
    (“Seagate, or the Company”) designs, manufactures and
    markets rigid disc drives. Rigid disc drives, which are commonly
    referred to as disc drives, are used as the primary medium for
    storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop
    and notebook computers and consumer electronics devices to data
    centers delivering information over corporate networks and the
    Internet. The Company produces a broad range of disc drive
    products addressing enterprise applications, where its products
    are primarily used in enterprise servers, mainframes and
    workstations; desktop applications, where its products are used
    in desktop computers; mobile computing applications, where its
    products are used in notebook computers; and consumer
    electronics applications, where its products are used in digital
    video recorders, digital music players and gaming devices. The
    Company sells its disc drives primarily to major original
    equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and retailers. The
    Company also provides data storage services through EVault, Inc.
    (“EVault”), which it acquired in fiscal year 2007. The
    Company also sells storage products containing its disc drives
    under the Seagate Technology (“Seagate”) and Maxtor
    Corporation (“Maxtor”) brands.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
    Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
    Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates. The methods, estimates and judgments the
    Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies
    have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in
    its consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined the
    most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most
    important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial
    condition and operating results, and require the Company to make
    its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
    of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly
    uncertain at the time of estimation. Based on this definition,
    the Company’s most critical policies include: establishment
    of sales program accruals, establishment of warranty accruals,
    valuation of deferred tax assets as well as the valuation of
    intangibles and goodwill. Below, these policies are discussed
    further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. The
    Company also has other key accounting policies and accounting
    estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts, valuation
    of inventory, valuation of share-based payments (see
    Note 3) and acquisition related restructuring (see
    Note 10). The Company believes that these other accounting
    policies and accounting estimates either do not generally
    require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult
    or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a
    material impact on the Company’s reported results of
    operations for a given period.

The Company establishes certain distributor and OEM sales
    programs aimed at increasing customer demand. For the
    distribution channel, these programs typically involve rebates
    related to a distributor’s level of sales, order size,
    advertising or point of sale activity and price protection
    adjustments. For OEM sales, rebates are typically based on an
    OEM customer’s volume of purchases from the Company or
    other agreed upon rebate programs. The Company provides for
    these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on
    estimated requirements. The Company estimates these
    contra-revenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors,
    including price reductions during the period reported, estimated
    future price erosion, customer orders, distributor sell-through
    and inventory levels, program participation, customer claim
    submittals and sales returns. The Company’s estimates
    reflect contractual arrangements but also the Company’s
    judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and
    attainment of program goals, and inventory and sell-through
    levels reported by the Company’s distribution customers.
    During periods in which the Company’s distributors’
    inventories of its products are at higher than historical
    levels, the Company’s sales programs estimates are subject
    to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual
    results to vary is accordingly higher. Currently, the
    Company’s distributors’ inventories are within the
    historical range. Significant actual variations in any of the
    factors upon which the Company bases its contra-revenue
    estimates could have a material effect on the Company’s
    operating results. In addition, the Company’s failure to
    accurately predict the level of future sales returns by its
    distribution customers could have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations.



SEAGATE
    TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company estimates product warranty costs at the time revenue
    is recognized. The Company generally warrants its products for a
    period of one to five years. The Company’s warranty
    provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends
    (including the timing of product returns during the warranty
    periods), estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated
    costs for customer compensatory claims related to product
    quality issues, if any. The Company uses a statistical model to
    help with its estimates and the Company exercises considerable
    judgment in determining the underlying estimates. Should actual
    experience in any future period differ significantly from its
    estimates, or should the rate of future product technological
    advancements fail to keep pace with the past, the Company’s
    future results of operations could be materially affected. The
    Company’s judgment is subject to a greater degree of
    subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products and
    legacy Maxtor-designed products because of limited experience
    with those products upon which to base its warranty estimates.
    The Company continually introduces new products and has recently
    begun a shift to disc drive products that utilize perpendicular
    recording technology. The actual results with regard to warranty
    expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations if the actual rate of unit
    failure, the cost to repair a unit, or the actual cost required
    to satisfy customer compensatory claims are greater than that
    which the Company has used in estimating the warranty expense
    accrual. The Company also exercises judgment in estimating its
    ability to sell certain repaired disc drives. To the extent such
    sales fall below the Company’s forecast, warranty cost will
    be adversely impacted.

The Company’s recording of deferred tax assets each period
    depends primarily on the Company’s ability to generate
    current and future taxable income in the United States and
    certain foreign jurisdictions. Each period, the Company
    evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for its deferred
    tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance so that net
    deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent the Company
    concludes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax
    assets will be realized. With the Company’s acquisition of
    Maxtor, the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets was
    determined on a consolidated return basis. As a result,
    Maxtor’s deferred tax assets that were determined to be
    realizable were recorded as a reduction of goodwill and Seagate
    deferred tax assets that were determined to be no longer
    realizable were written off with a charge to income tax expense
    at the date of acquisition.

In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement (“SFAS”)
    No. 141,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141”), the purchase price of
    an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired
    business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual
    of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The Company engages
    third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining
    the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant
    judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to
    intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value
    based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These
    estimates are based on historical experience and information
    obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are
    inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of
    the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future
    expected cash flows from existing technology, customer
    relationships, trade names, and other intangible assets; the
    acquired company’s brand awareness and market position, as
    well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand
    will continue to be used in the combined company’s product
    portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and
    circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or
    validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

The Company is required to periodically evaluate the carrying
    values of its intangible assets for impairment. If any of the
    Company’s intangible assets are determined to be impaired,
    the Company may have to write down the impaired asset and its
    earnings would be adversely impacted in the period that occurs.

At June 29, 2007, the Company’s goodwill totaled
    approximately $2.3 billion and its identifiable other
    intangible assets totaled $188 million. In accordance with
    the provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

(“SFAS No. 142”), the
    Company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually,
    or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances
    indicating that the carrying value may exceed its fair value.
    This assessment may require the projection and discounting of
    cash flows, an analysis of the Company’s market

capitalization and the estimation of the fair values of tangible
    and intangible assets and liabilities. Estimates of cash flow
    are based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about
    expected future operating performance; judgment is also
    exercised in determining an appropriate discount rate. The
    Company’s estimates of discounted cash flows may differ
    from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic
    conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in
    operating performance. Significant differences between these
    estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the
    Company’s future financial results.

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

— The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
    Company and all its wholly-owned subsidiaries, after elimination
    of intercompany transactions and balances.

The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal
    year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to
    June 30. Accordingly, fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005
    comprised 52 weeks and ended on June 29, 2007,
    June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005, respectively. All
    references to years in these notes to consolidated financial
    statements represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted. Fiscal
    year 2008 will be 52 weeks and will end on June 27,
    2008.

Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances, and Sales
    Incentive Programs

— The Company’s revenue
    recognition policy complies with Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB No. 104”). Revenue from sales of
    products, including sales to distribution customers, is
    generally recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to
    the buyer, which typically occurs upon shipment from the Company
    or third party warehouse facilities, persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, including a fixed price to the buyer, and
    when collectibility is reasonably assured. For our direct retail
    customers, revenue is recognized on a sell-through basis.
    Estimated product returns are provided for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists

. The Company also adheres to the requirements
    of Emerging Issue Task Force (“EITF”)

No. 01-09

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer

, (“EITF

No. 01-09”)

for sales incentive programs. The Company follows Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Technical

Bulletin 90-1,

Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and
    Product Maintenance Contracts

for sales of extended
    warranties.

Estimated reductions to revenue for sales incentive programs,
    such as price protection, and sales growth bonuses, are recorded
    when revenue is recorded. Marketing development programs are
    either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to
    marketing expense depending on the contractual nature of the
    program and whether the conditions of EITF

No. 01-09

have been met.

Product Warranty

— The Company warrants its
    products for periods ranging from one year to five years. A
    provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty
    returns is recorded when revenue is recognized and is included
    in cost of revenue. The Company offers extended warranties on
    certain products that customers may purchase. Deferred revenue
    in relation to extended warranties has not been material to
    date. Shipping and handling costs are also included in cost of
    revenue.

Inventory

— Inventories are valued at the lower
    of cost (which approximates actual cost using the

first-in,

first-out method) or market. Market value is based upon an
    estimated average selling price reduced by estimated cost of
    completion and disposal.

Property, Equipment, and Leasehold
    Improvements

— Land, equipment, buildings and
    leasehold improvements are stated at cost. The cost basis of
    assets acquired in the Maxtor business combination was based on
    estimated fair values at the date of acquisition (see
    Note 10). Equipment and buildings are depreciated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
    straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of
    the asset or the remaining term of the lease. The cost of
    additions and substantial improvements to property, equipment
    and leasehold improvements are capitalized. The cost of
    maintenance repairs to property, equipment and leasehold
    improvements is expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets

— The
    Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142. Goodwill represents the
    excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
    tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a
    business combination, and is not subject to amortization. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company tests goodwill for
    impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events and
    circumstances warrant. During the fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
    2005, the Company did not record any goodwill impairment.

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities
    accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are
    estimated by management based on the fair value of assets
    received. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with
    finite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated
    useful lives. The Company’s acquisition-related intangible
    assets are comprised of existing technology, customer
    relationships, trade names, and other intangible assets and are
    amortized over periods ranging from one to four years on a
    straight-line basis. SFAS No. 142 further requires that
    intangible assets be reviewed for impairment in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets

(“SFAS No. 144”). In fiscal year
    2007, the Company wrote off $8 million for the impairment of an
    intangible asset related to certain licensed technology and
    patents. No intangible impairment was recorded in fiscal years
    2006 and 2005.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company
    maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable
    based upon expected collectibility. This reserve is established
    based upon historical trends, current economic conditions and an
    analysis of specific exposures. The provision for doubtful
    accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative
    expense. In September 2006, the Company recorded an additional
    $40 million allowance for doubtful accounts due to the
    inherent uncertainties following the termination of its
    distributor relationships with eSys Technologies Pte. Ltd. and
    its affiliated entities (“eSys”). See Note 2.

Advertising Expense

— The cost of advertising
    is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were approximately
    $51 million, $40 million and $26 million in
    fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

— Effective
    July 2, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

,
    (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), using the
    modified-prospective-transition method, except for options
    granted prior to the Company’s initial filing of its
    registration statement on

Form S-1

in October 2002 for which the compensation cost was based on the
    intrinsic value method. As a result, the Company has included
    stock-based compensation costs in its results of operations for
    fiscal years 2007 and 2006 (see Note 3). The adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) had a material impact on the
    Company’s results of operations. Prior to July 2,
    2005, the Company accounted for employee stock-based
    compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion (“APBO”) No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APBO
    No. 25”), and related interpretations. The Company has
    elected to apply the with and without method to assess the
    realization of excess tax benefits.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Translation

— The U.S. dollar is the
    functional currency for all of the Company’s foreign
    operations. As a result, gains and losses on the remeasurement
    into U.S. dollars of amounts not denominated in
    U.S. dollars are included in net income (loss) for those
    operations.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— The Company
    applies the requirements of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”) and
    SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
    (“SFAS No. 149”). Both standards require
    that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
    value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness
    of hedging relationships (see Note 2).

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
    Investments

— The Company considers all highly
    liquid investments with a remaining maturity of 90 days or
    less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash
    equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
    The Company’s short-term investments are primarily
    comprised of readily marketable debt securities with remaining
    maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase.
    The Company has classified its entire investment portfolio as
    available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are



SEAGATE
    TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

classified as cash equivalents or short-term investments and are
    stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included
    in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a
    component of shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of
    debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
    accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and
    accretion are included in interest income. Realized gains and
    losses are included in other income (expense). The cost of
    securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
    The Company invests in auction rate securities. Auction rate
    securities that have stated maturities greater than three
    months, are classified as marketable securities unless they are
    purchased three months or less from contractual maturity.

Strategic Investments

— The Company enters into
    certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and
    strategic objectives and typically does not attempt to reduce or
    eliminate the inherent market risks on these investments. Both
    marketable and non-marketable investments are included in the
    accompanying balance sheets in other assets, net. Non-marketable
    investments are recorded at cost and are periodically analyzed
    to determine whether or not there are indicators of impairment.
    The carrying value of the Company’s strategic investments
    at June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006 totaled
    $25 million and $11 million, respectively.

Concentration of Credit Risk

— The
    Company’s customer base for disc drive products is
    concentrated with a small number of OEMs and distributors.
    Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk, are primarily accounts
    receivable, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The
    Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
    customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no
    collateral from its customers. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is based upon the expected collectibility of all
    accounts receivable. The Company places its cash equivalents and
    short-term investments in investment-grade, highly liquid debt
    instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
    issuer.

Supplier Concentration

— Certain of the raw
    materials and components used by the Company in the manufacture
    of its products are available from a limited number of
    suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential materials
    and components due to an interruption of supply or increased
    demand in the industry. If the Company were unable to procure
    certain of such materials or components, it would be required to
    reduce its manufacturing operations, which could have a material
    adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, the
    Company has made prepayments to certain suppliers. Should these
    suppliers be unable to deliver on their obligations or
    experience financial difficulty, the Company may not be able to
    recover these prepayments.

Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting
    Pronouncements

— In February 2007, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial
    Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an
    Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and
    losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected
    will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting
    date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on
    its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(“SFAS No. 158”). SFAS No. 158
    requires that the funded status of defined benefit
    postretirement plans be recognized on a company’s balance
    sheet, and changes in the funded status be reflected in
    comprehensive income, effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2006, which the Company adopted in its fiscal
    year ended June 29, 2007 and did not have a material impact
    on our consolidated results of operations or financial
    condition. SFAS No. 158 also requires companies to
    measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its
    fiscal year-end, effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2008. The Company expects to adopt the
    measurement provisions of SFAS No. 158 in its fiscal
    year 2010, effective June 30, 2009. The Company does not
    expect the adoption of SFAS No. 158 to have a material
    impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial
    condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”) which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles, and



SEAGATE
    TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
    Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that
    require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having
    previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that
    fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly,
    this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements.
    However, for some entities, the application of this Statement
    will change current practice. SFAS No. 157 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating
    the effect that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have
    on its consolidated results of operations and financial
    condition.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
    (“FIN”) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

(“FIN No. 48”). This
    Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. This
    Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006 and will be adopted
    by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The
    Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of
    FIN No. 48 will have on its consolidated results of
    operations and financial condition.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments

(“SFAS No. 155”), which amends
    SFAS No. 133, and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS No. 140”). SFAS No. 155
    simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in
    other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for
    as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire
    instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also
    clarifies and amends certain other provisions of
    SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140.
    SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
    instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement
    event occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided
    the company has not yet issued financial statements, including
    for interim periods, for that fiscal year. The Company does not
    expect the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material
    impact on its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— The Company
    recognizes all of its derivative financial instruments in the
    balance sheet as either assets or liabilities. All derivative
    financial instruments are carried at fair value. The effective
    portion of the gain or loss on a derivative designated as a cash
    flow hedge is reported in Other comprehensive income and the
    ineffective portion is reported in earnings. Amounts in Other
    comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the same
    period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects
    earnings. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument not
    qualifying for hedge accounting is recognized currently in
    earnings. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward
    exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign
    currency commitments, certain foreign currency denominated
    balance sheet positions and anticipated foreign currency
    denominated expenditures. The Company’s policy prohibits it
    from entering into derivative financial instruments for
    speculative or trading purposes. During fiscal years 2007, 2006
    and 2005, the Company did not enter into any hedges of net
    investments in foreign operations.

The Company has established a foreign currency hedging program
    to protect against the increase in value of foreign currency
    cash flows resulting from operating and capital expenditures
    over the next year. The Company hedges portions of its
    forecasted expenditures denominated in foreign currencies with
    forward exchange contracts. When the U.S. dollar weakens
    significantly against the foreign currencies, the increase in
    value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset by
    gains in the value of the forward exchange contracts designated
    as hedges. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthens, the
    decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is
    offset by losses in the value of the forward exchange contracts.
    These forward foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value,
    may have maturities up to twelve months.



SEAGATE
    TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company evaluates hedging effectiveness prospectively and
    retrospectively and records any ineffective portion of the
    hedging instruments in Other income (expense) on the Statement
    of Operations. The Company did not have any net gains (losses)
    recognized in Other income (expense) for cash flow hedges due to
    hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005.

As at June 29, 2007, the notional value of the
    Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward exchange
    contracts was approximately $86 million in Singapore
    dollars, $39 million in Malaysian ringgit and
    $23 million in Thai baht. The fair value of the
    Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward exchange
    contracts at June 29, 2007 was immaterial. The Company does
    not believe that these derivatives present significant credit
    risks, because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of
    major financial institutions, and it limits the notional amount
    on contracts entered into with any one counterparty. The Company
    maintains limits on maximum terms of contracts based on the
    credit rating of the financial institutions. As at June 30,
    2006, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding
    foreign currency forward exchange contracts was approximately
    $29 million in Singapore dollars, $18 million in Thai
    baht and $12 million in British pounds. The fair value of
    the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward exchange
    contracts at June 30, 2006 was immaterial.

The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and
    its primary foreign currency cash flows are in countries where
    it has a manufacturing presence. Net foreign currency
    transaction gains included in the determination of net income
    were $3 million, $4 million and $3 million for
    fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company terminated its distributor relationships with eSys
    and the Company ceased shipments of its products to eSys. eSys
    was the largest distributor of Seagate products (including
    Maxtor products) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006,
    representing approximately 5% the Company’s revenues.

The Company recorded $40 million of allowance for doubtful
    accounts in the three months ended September 29, 2006 due
    to the inherent uncertainties following the termination of the
    distribution relationships, eSys’ continuing delinquency in
    payments and failure to pay amounts when promised, and
    eSys’ failure to comply with the terms of its commercial
    agreements with the Company. The Company is pursuing collection
    of all amounts owed by eSys as promptly as possible. Any amounts
    recovered on these receivables will be recorded in the period
    received.

While the Company terminated its distributor relationships with
    eSys, the Company has and will continue to aggressively pursue
    any claims that may be assertable against eSys as a result of
    material breaches of the distribution agreements and any
    intentionally wrongful conduct that may have occurred.
    Specifically, the Company has commenced legal proceedings
    against eSys under a distribution agreement and a corporate
    guarantee, against its Chief Executive Officer on a personal
    guarantee, and the Company may initiate further legal
    proceedings under various distribution agreements to recover all
    amounts owed for purchased product.

In September 2006, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings
    (“HDD”), the Company’s wholly-owned direct
    subsidiary, issued senior notes totaling $1.5 billion
    comprised of $300 million aggregate principal amount of
    Floating Rate Senior Notes due October 2009 (the “2009
    Notes”), $600 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.375% Senior Notes due October 2011 (the “2011
    Notes”) and $600 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.8% Senior Notes due October 2016 (the “2016
    Notes”). These notes are unsecured and rank equally in
    right of payment with all of HDD’s other existing and
    future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior to any present
    and future subordinated indebtedness of HDD.

$300 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of Floating Rate
    Senior Notes due October 2009.

The 2009 Notes
    bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus
    0.84% per year, payable quarterly on January 1,
    April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. Interest
    payments commenced on January 1, 2007. The 2009 Notes will
    mature on October 1, 2009. The Company may not redeem the
    2009 Notes prior to maturity.

$600 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of Fixed Rate Senior
    Notes due October 2011.

The 2011 Notes bear

    not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a
    “make-whole” premium redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price will be equal to the
    greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes
    being redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the

remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the
    2011 Notes being redeemed, discounted at the redemption date on
    a semi-annual basis at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable
    Treasury rate plus 50 basis points.

$600 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of Fixed Rate Senior
    Notes due October 2016.

The 2016 Notes bear
    interest at the rate of 6.8% per year, payable semi-annually on

    redeemable at the option of the Company in whole or in part, on
    not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a
    “make-whole” premium redemption price. The
    “make-whole” redemption price will be equal to the
    greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes
    being redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the
    remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the
    2016 Notes being redeemed, discounted at the redemption date on
    a semi-annual basis at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable
    Treasury rate plus 50 basis points.

$135 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of
    6.8% Convertible Senior Notes due April 2010 (the
    “6.8% Notes”).

As a result of its
    acquisition of Maxtor on May 19, 2006, the Company assumed
    the 6.8% Notes. The 6.8% Notes require semi-annual
    interest payments payable on April 30 and October 30. The
    6.8% Notes are convertible into common shares of Seagate
    Technology at a conversion rate of approximately
    30.1733 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes.
    The Company may not redeem the 6.8% Notes prior to
    May 5, 2008. Thereafter, the Company may redeem the
    6.8% Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued
    and unpaid interest, if the closing price of the common shares
    for 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading
    days ending on the trading day before the date of the mailing of
    the redemption notice exceeds 130% of the conversion price on
    such trading day. If, at any time, substantially all of the
    common shares are exchanged or acquired for consideration that
    does not consist entirely of common shares that are listed on a
    United States national securities exchange or approved for
    quotation on the NASDAQ National Market or similar system, the
    holders of the notes have the right to require the Company to
    repurchase all or any portion of the notes at their face value
    plus accrued interest.

$326 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of
    2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due August 2012 (the
    “2.375% Notes”).

As a result of
    its acquisition of Maxtor on May 19, 2006, the Company
    assumed the 2.375% Notes. The 2.375% Notes require
    semi-annual interest payments payable on February 15 and
    August 15. The 2.375% Notes are convertible into
    common shares of Seagate Technology at a conversion rate of
    approximately 57.3380 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
    the notes, at the option of the holders, at any time during a
    fiscal quarter if, during the last 30 trading days of the
    immediately preceding fiscal quarter the common shares trade at
    a price in excess of 110% of the conversion price for 20
    consecutive trading days. Upon conversion, the 2.375% Notes
    are subject to “net cash” settlement whereby the
    Company will deliver cash for the lesser of the principal amount
    of the notes being converted or the “conversion value”
    of the notes which is calculated by multiplying the conversion
    rate then in effect by the market price of the Company’s
    common shares at the time of conversion. To the extent that the
    conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the
    2.375% Notes, the Company will, at its election, pay cash
    or issue common shares with a value equal to the value of such
    excess. If the 2.375% Notes are surrendered for conversion,
    the Company may direct the conversion agent to surrender those
    notes to a financial institution selected by the Company for
    exchange, in lieu of conversion, into a number of the
    Company’s common shares equal to the applicable conversion
    rate, plus cash for any fractional shares, or cash or a
    combination of cash and the Company’s common shares in lieu
    thereof. The 2.375% Notes are classified as a current
    liability on the consolidated balance sheets because they are
    currently convertible as the Company’s share price was in
    excess of 110% of the conversion price for at least 20
    consecutive trading days during the last 30 trading days of the
    fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The payment of dividends to
    holders of our common shares may in certain future quarters
    result in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the
    2.375% Notes.

$50 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of
    5.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 2012 (the
    “5.75% Debentures”).

As a result
    of the Maxtor acquisition, the Company assumed the
    5.75% Debentures. The 5.75% Debentures require
    semi-annual interest payments on March 1 and September 1 and
    annual sinking fund payments of $5 million or repurchases
    of $5 million in principal amount of debentures in lieu of
    sinking fund

payments. The 5.75% Debentures are currently convertible
    for a cash payment of $167.50 per $1,000 principal amount of
    debentures.

$60 million LIBOR Based China Manufacturing Facility
    Loan.

As a result of the Maxtor acquisition, the
    Company assumed an outstanding plant construction loan in the
    amount of $30 million and an outstanding project loan in
    the amount of $30 million from the Bank of China to Maxtor
    Suzhou (“MTS”). These borrowings are collateralized by
    the Company’s facilities in Suzhou, China. The interest
    rate on the plant construction loan is LIBOR plus 60 basis
    points, with the borrowings repayable in two installment
    payments of $15 million each, one due in October 2008 and
    the other due in April 2009. The interest rate on the project
    loan is LIBOR plus 100 basis points, and the borrowing is
    repayable in August 2009. Interest payments on both the
    construction loan and the project loan are made semi-annually on
    October 15 and April 15. The loans require MTS to maintain
    annual financial covenants, including a maximum liability to
    assets ratio and a minimum earnings to interest expense ratio,
    with which MTS was in compliance at June 29, 2007.

In accordance with APBO No. 14,

Accounting for
    Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants,

(“APBO 14”), the Company determined the existence
    of substantial premium for both the 2.375% Notes and
    6.8% Notes and recorded the notes at par value with the
    resulting excess over par (the substantial premium) recorded in
    Additional Paid-In Capital in Shareholders’ Equity. All
    other debt assumed in the Maxtor acquisition was recorded at
    fair market value (see Note 10).

$400 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 8% Senior
    Notes Previously due May 2009.

In October 2006,
    the Company redeemed its 8% Senior Notes due May 2009 (the
    “8% Notes”) at a redemption price of $1,040 per
    $1,000 principal amount of Notes for a total amount paid of
    $416 million. The redemption premium of $16 million as
    well as approximately $3 million of unamortized issuance
    costs were recorded as interest expense in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The Company has guaranteed all Senior Notes on a full and
    unconditional basis (see Note 14).

Revolving Credit Facility.

HDD has a senior
    unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility that
    matures in September 2011. The $500 million revolving
    facility, which was entered into in September 2006, replaced the
    then-existing $100 million revolving credit facility.

The credit agreement that governs the Company’s revolving
    credit facility contains covenants that must be satisfied in
    order to remain in compliance with the agreement. The credit
    agreement contains three financial covenants: (1) minimum
    cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; (2) a
    fixed charge coverage ratio; and (3) a net leverage ratio.
    As of June 29, 2007, the Company is in compliance with all
    covenants.

The $500 million revolving credit facility is available for
    cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to
    a sub-limit of $100 million. Although no borrowings have
    been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date, the
    Company had utilized $47 million for outstanding letters of
    credit and bankers’ guarantees as of June 29, 2007,
    leaving $453 million for additional borrowings. The credit
    agreement governing the revolving credit facility includes
    limitations on the ability of the Company to pay dividends,
    including a limit of $300 million in any four consecutive
    quarters.

Compensation

Tax-Deferred
    Savings Plan

The Company has a tax-deferred savings plan, the Seagate 401(k)
    Plan (“the 40l(k) plan”), for the benefit of qualified
    employees. The 40l(k) plan is designed to provide employees with
    an accumulation of funds at retirement. Qualified employees may
    elect to make contributions to the 401(k) plan on a monthly
    basis. During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company made
    matching contributions of $15 million, $13 million and
    $13 million, respectively.

Stock-Based
    Benefit Plans

Seagate Technology 2001 Share Option
    Plan

— In December 2000, the Company’s board
    of directors adopted the Seagate Technology 2001 Share
    Option Plan (the “2001 Plan”). Under the terms of the
    2001 Plan, eligible employees, directors, and consultants can be
    awarded options to purchase common shares of the Company under
    vesting terms to be determined at the date of grant. A maximum
    of 100 million common shares is issuable under the 2001
    Plan. Options granted to exempt employees will generally vest as
    follows: 25% of the shares will vest on the first anniversary of
    the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% will vest
    proportionately each month over the next 36 months. Options
    granted to non-exempt employees will vest on the first
    anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Except for certain
    options granted below deemed fair value shortly prior to the
    Company’s initial public offering in fiscal year 2003, all
    other options granted under the 2001 Plan were granted at fair
    market value, with options granted up through September 5,
    2004 expiring ten years from the date of grant and options
    granted subsequent to September 5, 2004 expiring seven
    years from the date of grant. As of June 29, 2007, there
    were approximately 84,000 shares available for issuance
    under the 2001 Plan.

Seagate Technology 2004 Stock Compensation
    Plan

— On August 5, 2004, the Company’s
    board of directors adopted the Seagate Technology 2004 Stock
    Compensation Plan (the “2004 Plan”), and on
    October 28, 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved
    the 2004 Plan. The purpose of the 2004 Plan, which is intended
    to supplement and eventually succeed the Company’s 2001
    Plan, is to promote the Company’s long-term growth and
    financial success by providing incentives to its employees,
    directors, and consultants through grants of share-based awards.
    On October 26, 2006, the Company’s shareholders
    approved an amendment to the 2004 Plan to increase the number of
    common shares available for issuance by 36 million,
    bringing the total amount of common shares authorized to be
    issued under the 2004 Plan to 63.5 million. The provisions
    of the 2004 Plan, which allows for the grant of various types of
    equity-based awards, are also intended to provide greater
    flexibility to maintain the Company’s competitive

ability to attract, retain and motivate participants for the
    benefit of the Company and its shareholders. Options granted to

— In connection
    with the Company’s acquisition of Maxtor, the Company
    assumed all outstanding options to purchase Maxtor common stock
    with a weighted-average exercise price of $16.10 on an
    as-converted basis. Each option assumed was converted into an

    applying the exchange ratio of 0.37 Company common shares for
    each share of Maxtor common stock. In total, the Company assumed
    and converted Maxtor options into options to purchase
    approximately 7.1 million of the Company’s common
    shares. In addition, the Company assumed and converted all
    outstanding Maxtor nonvested stock into approximately
    1.3 million of the Company’s nonvested shares, based
    on the 0.37 exchange ratio. The assumed options and nonvested
    shares exchanged retained all applicable terms and vesting
    periods. As of June 29, 2007, approximately
    2.0 million of the assumed options and 1.3 million of
    the exchanged nonvested shares were outstanding.

    completely vested and exercisable.

Stock Purchase Plan —

The Company established
    an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) in December
    2002. At that time, a total of 20 million common shares had
    been authorized for issuance under the ESPP. On October 26,
    2006, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to
    the ESPP to increase the number of common shares available for
    issuance by 10 million bringing the total amount of common
    shares authorized to be issued under the ESPP to
    30 million. In no event shall the total number of shares
    issued under the ESPP exceed 75 million shares. The ESPP
    consists of a six-month offering period with a maximum issuance
    of 2.5 million shares per offering period. The ESPP permits
    eligible employees who have completed thirty days of employment
    prior to the commencement of any offering period to purchase
    common shares through payroll deductions generally at 85% of the
    fair market value of the common shares. On July 31, 2006,

    under the ESPP, with a weighted-average purchase price of
    $16.45. On January 31, 2007, the Company issued
    approximately 1.7 million common shares under the ESPP,
    with a weighted-average purchase

    issuance under the ESPP.

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R)

Prior to July 2, 2005, the Company’s stock-based
    employee compensation plans were accounted for under the
    recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles
    Board Opinion (“APBO”) No. 25,

Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees

(“APBO No. 25”),
    and related Interpretations, as permitted by FASB No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
    (“SFAS No. 123”). The Company generally did
    not recognize stock-based compensation cost in its statement of
    operations for periods prior to July 2, 2005 as most
    options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value
    of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. However,
    compensation expense was recognized under APBO No. 25 for
    certain options granted shortly prior to the Company’s
    initial public offering of its common shares in December 2002
    based upon the intrinsic value (the difference between the
    exercise price at the date of grant and the deemed fair value of
    the common shares based on the anticipated initial public
    offering share price).

Effective July 2, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

,
    (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), using the
    modified-prospective-transition method, except for options
    granted prior to the Company’s initial filing of its
    registration statement on

Form S-1

in October 2002 for which the compensation cost was based on the
    intrinsic value method. Under this transition method,
    stock-based compensation cost recognized during the fiscal year
    ended 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost based on the
    intrinsic value method for options granted prior to the
    Company’s initial filing of its registration statement on

Form S-1

in October 2002, (b) compensation cost for all unvested
    stock-based awards as of July 2, 2005 that were granted
    subsequent to the Company’s initial filing of its
    registration statement on

Form S-1

in October 2002 and prior to July 2, 2005, based on the
    grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
    provisions of SFAS No. 123 and (c) compensation
    cost for all stock-based awards granted subsequent to
    July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated
    in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).
    Results for prior periods have not been restated.

Determining
    Fair Value

Valuation and amortization method

— The Company
    estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula and a single option
    award approach. This fair value is then amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the
    awards, which is generally the vesting period or the remaining
    service (vesting) period.

Expected Term

— The Company’s expected
    term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based
    awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based
    on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration
    to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting
    schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as
    influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards.

Expected Volatility —

Stock-based payments made
    prior to the Company’s initial filing of its registration
    statement on

Form S-1

in October 2002 were accounted for using the intrinsic value
    method under APBO 25. The fair value of stock based payments
    made subsequent to the Company’s initial filing of its
    registration statement on

Form S-1

in October 2002 through the quarter ended October 1, 2004,
    were valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method with
    a volatility factor based on the stock volatilities of the
    Company’s largest publicly traded competitors because the
    Company did not have a sufficient trading history. Commencing in
    the quarter ending December 31, 2004 and through the
    quarter ended July 1, 2005 the Company’s volatility
    factor was estimated using its own trading history. Effective
    July 2, 2005, pursuant to the SEC’s Staff Accounting
    Bulletin 107, the Company reevaluated the assumptions used
    to estimate volatility, including whether implied volatility of
    its traded options appropriately reflects the market’s
    expectations of future volatility and determined that it would
    use a combination



SEAGATE
    TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of the implied volatility of its traded options and historical
    volatility of its share price. The impact of this change in the
    assumptions used to determine volatility was not significant.

Expected Dividend

— The Black-Scholes-Merton
    valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an
    input. The dividend yield is determined by dividing the expected
    per share dividend during the coming year by the grant date
    share price. The expected dividend assumption is based on the
    Company’s current expectations about its anticipated
    dividend policy. Also, because the expected dividend yield
    should reflect marketplace participants’ expectations, the
    Company does not incorporate changes in dividends anticipated by
    management unless those changes have been communicated to or
    otherwise are anticipated by marketplace participants.

Risk-Free Interest Rate

— The Company bases the
    risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton
    valuation method on the implied yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent
    remaining term. Where the expected term of the Company’s
    stock-based awards do not correspond with the terms for which
    interest rates are quoted, the Company performed a straight-line
    interpolation to determine the rate from the available term
    maturities.

Estimated Forfeitures

— When estimating
    forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination
    behavior as well as analysis of actual option forfeitures.

Fair Value

— The fair value of the
    Company’s stock options granted to employees, assumed from
    Maxtor and issued from the ESPP for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were estimated using the following weighted-average

$16 million of stock-based compensation in fiscal years
    2007 and 2006, respectively in connection with the assumed
    options and nonvested shares exchanged in the Maxtor acquisition
    (see Note 10).

As required by SFAS No. 123(R), management made an
    estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation
    costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company
    presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the
    exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in its
    statement of cash flows. In accordance with guidance in
    SFAS No. 123(R), the cash flows resulting from excess
    tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds
    from employee’s exercises of stock options over the
    stock-based compensation cost recognized for those options) are
    classified as financing cash flows. The Company did not
    recognize any cash flows from excess tax benefits during fiscal
    year 2007. The Company recorded approximately $44 million
    of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow during fiscal
    year 2006.

The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference
    between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the
    quoted price of the Company’s common shares for the
    39.7 million options that were in-the-money at
    June 29, 2007. During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 the
    aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the
    Company’s stock option plans was $280 million,
    $228 million and $163 million, respectively,
    determined as of the date of option exercise. The aggregate fair
    value of options vested during fiscal year 2007 was
    approximately $101 million.

At June 29, 2007 the total compensation cost related to
    options granted to employees under the Company’s stock
    option plans (excluding options assumed in the Maxtor
    acquisition) but not yet recognized was approximately
    $141 million, net of estimated forfeitures of approximately
    $30 million. This cost is being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining term of
    approximately 2.3 years and will be adjusted for subsequent
    changes in estimated forfeitures. In addition to the stock-based
    compensation cost not yet recognized under the Company’s
    stock option plans, the Company has additional stock-based
    compensation costs related to options assumed in the Maxtor
    acquisition of approximately $7 million, which will be
    amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately
    1.8 years.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted a deferred
    compensation plan for the benefit of eligible employees. This
    plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer
    contributions, in excess of the tax limits applicable to the
    401(k) plan and to permit employee deferrals in excess of
    certain tax limits. Company assets earmarked to pay benefits
    under the plan are held by a rabbi trust. The Company has
    adopted the provisions of EITF

No. 97-14,

Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where
    Amounts Earned are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested

(“EITF 97-14”).

Under

EITF 97-14,

the assets and liabilities of a rabbi trust must be accounted
    for as assets and liabilities of the Company. In addition all
    earnings and expenses of the rabbi trust are recorded as other
    income or expense in the Company’s financial statements. At
    June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006, the deferred
    compensation amounts related to the rabbi trust were
    approximately $136 million and $101 million,
    respectively, and are included in Other Assets, net and Accrued
    expenses on the accompanying balance sheets.

As a result of the Maxtor acquisition, the Company acquired a
    deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible
    employees, which is designed to permit certain discretionary
    employer contributions, in excess of the tax limits applicable
    to the 401(k) plan and to permit employee deferrals in excess of
    certain tax limits. Company assets earmarked to pay benefits
    under the plan are held by a rabbi trust. At June 29, 2007,
    the deferred compensation amounts related to the rabbi trust was
    approximately $3 million.

Post-Retirement
    Medical Plan

The Company’s post-retirement medical plan offered medical
    coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible
    dependents that were enrolled prior to July 2, 2004.
    Substantially all U.S. employees became eligible for these
    benefits after 15 years of service and attaining
    age 60. The Company’s measurement date is
    March 31

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Company
    discontinued subsidizing its post-retirement medical plan for
    new retirees subsequent to July 2, 2004. As a result, the
    benefit obligation accrued prior to July 2, 2004 for
    current company employees was eliminated and the Company
    recorded a reduction in operating expenses of approximately
    $14 million in its first quarter of fiscal year 2005
    related to this reduction in benefit obligation. The components
    of net periodic benefit cost associated with the Company’s
    post-retirement medical plan for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were
    not significant. The remaining benefit obligation at
    June 29, 2007 was not significant.

For fiscal year 2007 there were no tax benefits recorded to
    Additional Paid-In Capital associated with stock option
    deductions. Current tax expense of $44 million and
    $15 million for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively,
    was associated with stock option deductions, the tax benefits of
    which were recorded directly to Additional Paid-In Capital.

The U.S. federal and state deferred tax benefit of
    $359 million for fiscal year 2007 includes
    $319 million of deferred tax benefit resulting from the
    release of valuation allowance recorded in prior years for
    deferred tax assets (see discussion of valuation allowance

During fiscal year 2007 the Company reduced its valuation
    allowance recorded in prior years for deferred tax assets by
    $641 million of which $319 million was recorded as a
    deferred tax benefit and $322 million was recorded a as
    reduction to Maxtor goodwill. The release of the previously
    recorded U.S. valuation allowance was largely due to the
    completion during 2007 of the restructuring of the
    Company’s intercompany arrangements, which will enable the
    Company to forecast future U.S. taxable income with greater
    certainty and U.S. taxable income from the intercompany
    sale of certain Maxtor assets.



SEAGATE
    TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The $322 million reduction in the Maxtor goodwill was
    required in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“SFAS No. 109”) as a result of the
    reversal of valuation allowance that had been previously
    recorded as of the date of acquisition against Maxtor related
    deferred tax assets primarily for tax net operating loss
    carryovers. The valuation allowance was reduced primarily to
    reflect the realization of acquired Maxtor net operating loss
    carry forwards due to increased forecasts of future
    U.S. taxable income and a $296 million gain for
    U.S. tax purposes from the intercompany sale of certain
    intellectual property rights to a foreign subsidiary.
    Approximately $120 million of tax expense associated with
    the gain on the intercompany sale of intangibles has been
    capitalized in accordance with Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

(“ARB No. 51”) and is being amortized to
    income tax expense over a sixty-month period, which approximates
    the expected useful life of the intangibles sold in the
    intercompany transaction.

As of June 29, 2007, the valuation allowance recorded was
    $399 million. Approximately $22 million relates to
    deferred tax assets acquired in the Maxtor transaction for which
    the related benefit will be credited directly to goodwill when
    and if realized. The net decrease in the valuation allowance in
    fiscal 2007 was $580 million. In fiscal years 2006 and
    2005, the valuation allowance increased by $327 million and
    $111 million respectively.

At June 29, 2007, the Company had recorded
    $768 million of net deferred tax assets. The realization of
    $663 million of these deferred tax assets is primarily
    dependent on the Company generating sufficient U.S. and
    certain foreign taxable income in future periods. Although
    realization is not assured, the Company’s management
    believes that it is more likely than not these deferred tax
    assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets
    considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease, when
    the Company reevaluates the underlying basis for its estimates
    of future U.S. and certain foreign taxable income.

At June 29, 2007, the Company had U.S. federal, state
    and foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards of
    approximately $2 billion, $886 million and
    $534 million, respectively, which will expire at various
    dates beginning in 2008 if not utilized. At June 29, 2007,
    the Company had U.S. federal and state tax credit
    carryforwards of $232 million and $68 million,
    respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in
    2008, if not utilized. These net operating losses and tax credit
    carryforwards have not been audited by the relevant tax
    authorities and could be subject to adjustment on examination.
    Of the $2 billion of loss carryovers noted above,
    approximately $591 million will be credited to Additional
    Paid-in Capital upon recognition.

As a result of the Maxtor acquisition, Maxtor underwent a change
    in ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the
    Internal Revenue Code (IRC Sec. 382) on May 19, 2006.
    In general, IRC Section 382 places annual limitations on
    the use of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses
    and tax credit carryovers in existence at the ownership change
    date. As of June 29, 2007, approximately $1.4 billion
    and $337 million of U.S. federal and state net
    operating losses, respectively, and $47 million of tax
    credit carryovers acquired from Maxtor are generally subject to
    an annual limitation of approximately $110 million. Certain
    amounts may be accelerated into the first five years following
    the acquisition pursuant to IRC Section 382 and published
    notices.

On January 3, 2005, the Company underwent a change in
    ownership under IRC Section 382 due to the sale of common
    shares to the public by its then largest shareholder, New SAC.
    Based on an independent valuation as of January 3, 2005,
    the annual limitation for this change is $44.8 million. As
    of June 29, 2007, there is $447 million of
    U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and $111 million
    of U.S. tax credit carryforwards subject to IRC
    Section 382 limitation associated with the January 3,
    2005 change. To the extent management believes it is more likely
    than not that the deferred tax assets associated with tax
    attributes subject to IRC Section 382 limitations will not
    be realized, a valuation allowance has been provided.

A substantial portion of the Company’s manufacturing
    operations in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland and
    Thailand operate under various tax holidays and tax incentive
    programs, which expire in whole or in part at various dates
    through 2020. Certain of the tax holidays may be extended if
    specific conditions are met. The net impact of these tax
    holidays and tax incentive programs was to increase the
    Company’s net income by approximately $194 million in
    fiscal year 2007 ($0.33 per share, diluted), an increase the
    Company’s net income by $197 million in fiscal year
    2006 ($0.38 per share, diluted), and an increase the
    Company’s net income by approximately $133 million in
    fiscal year 2005 ($0.26 per share, diluted).

The Company consists of a foreign parent holding company with
    various foreign and U.S. subsidiaries. Dividend
    distributions received from the Company’s
    U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. withholding
    taxes when, and if, distributed. Deferred tax liabilities have
    not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain other
    foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to
    tax in the Cayman Islands or U.S. federal income tax if
    remitted to the foreign parent holding company.

The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining federal
    income tax returns of certain of the Company’s
    U.S. subsidiaries for fiscal years ending in 2001 through
    2004. The timing of the settlement of these examinations is
    uncertain. The Company believes that adequate amounts of tax
    have been provided for any final assessments that may result.

Prior to fiscal 2007, certain U.S. subsidiaries of the
    Company were included in certain unitary and combined
    U.S. state tax returns with certain U.S. affiliates of
    New SAC and were parties to a tax sharing agreement effective
    November 23, 2000. In January 2005, one of the
    U.S. subsidiaries, Certance (US) Holdings, Inc.
    (“Certance”) was sold to a third party and as a

Restructuring
    Costs and Other

Ongoing
    Restructuring Activities

During fiscal year 2007, the Company recorded restructuring
    costs of approximately $33 million in connection with its
    ongoing restructuring activities. These costs were primarily a
    result of a restructuring plan established to continue the
    alignment of the Company’s global workforce with existing
    and anticipated business requirements, primarily in its
    U.S. and Far East operations and asset impairments. The
    restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs
    of approximately $14 million relating to a reduction in the
    Company’s workforce, approximately $11 million in
    charges related to impaired facility improvements and equipment
    as a result of the alignment plan, and approximately
    $8 million in charges related to impaired other
    intangibles. Fair value of the facility improvements, equipment,
    and other intangibles were determined to be zero since no future
    cash flows are expected to be generated from them. These
    restructuring and impairment charges are reported in
    Restructuring and other in the Consolidated Statement of
    Operations. The Company expects these restructuring activities
    to be completed by June 27, 2008. Additionally, the Company
    reversed $4 million of restructuring accruals relating to
    the sale of a surplus building impaired in a prior restructuring.

During fiscal year 2006, the Company recorded restructuring
    costs of approximately $4 million in connection with its
    ongoing restructuring activities. These costs were related to a
    restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of the
    Company’s global workforce with existing and anticipated
    business requirements in its Far East operations. The
    restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs
    relating to a continuing effort to optimize our production
    around the world. The Company has completed these restructuring
    activities.

During fiscal year 2005, the Company recorded restructuring
    costs of $8 million in connection with its on-going
    restructuring activities. These costs were primarily a result of
    a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of
    the Company’s global workforce with existing and
    anticipated business requirements, primarily in its
    U.S. operations. The restructuring costs were comprised of
    employee termination costs of approximately $5 million
    relating to a reduction in the Company’s workforce and
    approximately $3 million in charges related to impaired
    facility improvements as a result of the alignment plan. These
    restructuring activities were substantially completed as of
    March 31, 2006. Additionally, the Company reversed
    approximately $8 million of its restructuring accruals
    comprised of approximately $3 million recorded in prior
    fiscal years relating to accrued severance benefits that were
    less than amounts originally estimated and approximately
    $5 million relating to the sale in the first quarter of
    fiscal year 2005 of a surplus building previously impaired in
    the fiscal year 2000 restructuring.

    Capital

The Company’s authorized share capital is $13,500 and

    which 534,981,463 shares were outstanding as of
    June 29, 2007 and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value
    $0.00001, of which none were issued or outstanding as of
    June 29, 2007.

Common shares

— Holders of common shares are
    entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the
    Company’s board of directors (the “Board of
    Directors”). Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding
    up of the Company, after required payments are made to holders
    of preferred shares, any remaining assets of the Company will be
    distributed ratably to holders of the preferred and common
    shares. Holders of shares are entitled to one vote per share on
    all matters upon which the common shares are entitled to vote,
    including the election of directors.

Preferred shares

— The Company is authorized to
    issue up to a total of 100,000,000 preferred shares in one or
    more series, without shareholder approval. The Board of
    Directors is authorized to establish from time to time the
    number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the
    rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly
    unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations or
    restrictions. The Board of Directors can also increase or
    decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the
    number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any
    further vote or action by the shareholders.

The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred
    shares with voting or conversion rights that could harm the
    voting power or other rights of the holders of the common
    shares. The issuance of preferred shares, while providing
    flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other
    corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect
    of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the
    Company and might harm the market price of its common shares and
    the voting and other rights of the holders of common shares. As
    of June 29, 2007, there were no shares of preferred shares
    outstanding.

Issuance
    of Common Shares

During fiscal year 2007, the Company issued approximately
    17.3 million of its common shares from the exercise of
    stock options and approximately 3.4 million of its common
    shares related to the Company’s employee stock purchase
    plan.

Repurchases
    of Equity Securities

On August 8, 2006, the Company announced that its board of
    directors authorized the use of up to $2.5 billion for the
    repurchase of the Company’s outstanding common shares over
    a two-year period. From the authorization of this repurchase
    program and through the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007,
    the Company repurchased approximately 62.0 million shares,
    all of which were cancelled and are no longer outstanding. The
    Company repurchased these shares through a combination of open
    market purchases and prepaid forward agreements with large
    financial institutions, according to which the Company prepaid
    the financial institutions a fixed amount to deliver a variable
    number of shares at future dates. The Company entered into these
    agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at
    a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price
    (“VWAP”) of its common shares. The Company’s
    policy to date has been to enter into such transactions only
    when the discount that it receives is higher than the foregone
    return on its cash prepayment to the financial institution.
    There were no explicit commissions or fees on these prepaid
    forward agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, there
    was no requirement for the financial institutions to return any
    portion of the prepayment to the Company. These prepaid forward
    agreements were not derivatives because the Company had prepaid
    all amounts and had no remaining obligation. The agreements do
    not contain an embedded derivative. The prepayments were
    recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity when paid
    and the shares were deducted from shares outstanding. The
    agreements require the physical delivery of shares; there were
    no settlement alternatives, except in the case of certain
    defined extraordinary events which are outside the control of
    Seagate and the financial institutions. The parameters used to
    calculate the final number of shares deliverable were the total
    notional amount of the contract and the average VWAP of the
    Company’s stock during the contract period less the agreed
    upon discount. The contracts are indexed solely to the price of
    Seagate’s common shares.

During fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased
    24.3 million shares through open market repurchases. In
    addition, the Company made payments totaling $950 million
    under prepaid forward agreements and took delivery of
    37.7 million shares using prepaid forward agreements.
    Shares physically delivered to the Company were cancelled and
    were no longer outstanding. At June 29, 2007, there were no
    outstanding prepaid forward agreements to repurchase the
    Company’s common shares.

As of June 29, 2007, the Company had approximately
    $974 million remaining under the authorized
    $2.5 billion stock repurchase program. Share repurchases

Commitments

Leases

— The Company leases certain property,
    facilities and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements.
    Land and facility leases expire at various dates through 2082
    and contain various provisions for rental adjustments including,
    in certain cases, a provision based on increases in the Consumer
    Price Index. Also, certain leases provide for renewal of the
    lease at the Company’s option at expiration of the lease.
    All of the leases require the Company to pay property taxes,
    insurance and normal maintenance costs.

Future minimum lease payments for operating leases with initial
    or remaining terms of one year or more were as follows at
    June 29, 2007 (lease payments are shown net of sublease

    fiscal year 2007 was $11 million and $6 million for
    each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005. The Company subleases a
    portion of its facilities that it considers to be in excess of
    current requirements. As of June 29, 2007, total future
    lease income to be recognized for the Company’s existing
    subleases is approximately $32 million.

The Company established both adverse and favorable leasehold
    interests and for exit costs that apply directly to the lease
    commitments assumed through the acquisition of Maxtor. As of
    June 29, 2007, in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
    the Company has recorded a $62 million adverse leasehold
    interest and a $4 million favorable leasehold interest.
    Both the adverse and favorable leasehold interest reserve is
    being amortized to Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses over
    the remaining duration of the leases. In addition, the Company
    had $28 million remaining in accrued exit costs related to
    the planned exit of leased excess facilities at June 29,
    2007.

Capital Expenditures

— The Company’s
    commitments for construction of manufacturing facilities and

Legal,
    Environmental, and Other Contingencies

In accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

the Company assesses the probability of an unfavorable
    outcome of all its material litigation, claims, or assessments
    to determine whether a liability had been incurred and whether
    it is probable that one or more future events will occur
    confirming the fact of the loss. In the event that an
    unfavorable outcome is determined to be probable and the amount
    of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company establishes
    an accrual for the litigation, claim or assessment. Litigation
    is inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or
    decisions. Additionally, we may enter into settlements or be
    subject to judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate,
    have a material adverse effect adverse effect on our results of
    operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially.

Convolve, Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Between 1998 and 1999, Convolve, Inc., a
    small privately held technology consulting firm founded by an
    MIT Ph.D., engaged in discussions with Seagate Technology, Inc.
    with respect to the potential license of technology that
    Convolve claimed to own. During that period, the parties entered
    into non-disclosure agreements. We declined Convolve’s
    offer of a license in late 1999. On July 13, 2000, Convolve
    and MIT filed suit against Compaq Computer Corporation and us in
    the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
    York, alleging patent infringement, misappropriation of trade
    secrets, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract
    and fraud relating to Convolve and MIT’s Input
    Shaping

and Convolve’s Quick and QuietTM technology. The plaintiffs
    claim their technology is incorporated in our sound barrier
    technology, which was publicly announced on June 6, 2000.
    The complaint seeks injunctive relief, $800 million in
    compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages. We
    answered the complaint on August 2, 2000 and filed
    counterclaims for declaratory judgment that two Convolve/MIT
    patents are invalid and not infringed and that we own any
    intellectual property based on the information that we disclosed
    to Convolve. The court denied plaintiffs’ motion for
    expedited discovery and ordered plaintiffs to identify their
    trade secrets to defendants before discovery could begin.
    Convolve served a trade secrets disclosure on August 4,
    2000, and we filed a motion challenging the disclosure
    statement. On May 3, 2001, the court appointed a special
    master to review the trade secret issues. The special master
    resigned on June 5, 2001, and the court appointed another
    special master on July 26, 2001. After a hearing on our
    motion challenging the trade secrets disclosure on
    September 21, 2001, the special master issued a report and
    recommendation to the court that the trade secret list was
    insufficient. Convolve revised the trade secret list, and the
    court entered an order on January 1, 2002, accepting the
    special master’s recommendation that this trade secret list
    was adequate. On November 6, 2001, the USPTO issued US
    Patent No. 6,314,473 to Convolve. Convolve filed an amended
    complaint on January 16, 2002, alleging defendants’
    infringement of this patent, and we answered and filed
    counterclaims on February 8, 2002. Discovery is in process.
    On July 26, 2002, we filed a Rule 11 motion
    challenging the adequacy of plaintiffs’ pre-filing
    investigation on the first two patents alleged in the complaint
    and seeking dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims related to
    these patents and reimbursement of attorney’s fees. The
    court denied our motion on May 23, 2003. We believe that
    the claims are without merit, and we intend to defend against
    them vigorously. On May 6, 2003, the USPTO issued to
    Convolve U.S. Patent No. 6,560,658 B2, entitled
    “Data Storage Device with Quick and Quiet Modes.”
    Convolve has indicated that it will seek leave of the court to
    add this patent to the lawsuit. This latest patent is a
    continuation of a patent currently in the lawsuit
    (U.S. Patent No. 6,314,473). We similarly believe any
    claims that may relate to this continuation patent would be
    without merit, regardless of whether such claims were added to
    the ongoing litigation or asserted against us in a separate
    lawsuit. Judge John Martin, who was assigned this case,
    announced his retirement from the federal bench. The case was
    reassigned to Judge George B. Daniels.

On October 14, 2003, the Special Master resigned from the
    case due to Convolve’s claim that he had a conflict of
    interest. Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV was
    appointed to handle all discovery matters. Plaintiffs have
    indicated that they will dismiss claims regarding
    U.S. Patent No. 5,638,267 from the case. The claims
    construction hearing on U.S. Patent Nos. 4,916,635 and
    6,314,473 was held on March 30 and 31, 2004. On August 11,
    2005, the court entered an order construing the patent claims.
    Both Seagate and Compaq moved for reconsideration of its claim
    construction in light of intervening new law in the Federal
    Circuit’s recent decision in

Phillips v. AWH Corp.,
    et al.

, 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Convolve also moved
    for clarification. The court denied reconsideration without oral
    argument on December 7, 2005. The court later granted
    Convolve’s unopposed clarification motion. On
    March 29, 2006, the court granted Seagate’s summary
    judgment motion that Convolve’s fraud, tortious
    interference with contract, unfair competition, and breach of
    confidence claims are preempted by the California Uniform Trade
    Secrets Act (CUTSA). The court also held that while
    Convolve’s claim for breach of the covenant of good faith
    and fair dealing is not preempted by the CUTSA, no tort damages
    are available. The court denied our motion for summary judgment
    on a trade secret issue, finding there is an issue of fact that
    must be decided. Finally, the court entered an order on
    July 14, 2006, that Convolve has no evidence to prove its
    claims regarding 10 alleged trade secrets, precluding Convolve
    from proceeding at trial on those claims, and precluding
    Convolve from alleging

    Seagate’s request, the USPTO has determined that both
    patents in suit have substantial new issues of patentability and
    have ordered reexamination of the patents. The court recently
    denied our motion to stay the case pending patent reexamination.
    No trial date has been set. We believe the claims are without

Shao Tong, et al. v. Seagate International (Wuxi) Co.,
    Ltd.

In July 2002, we were sued in the
    People’s Court of Nanjing City, China, by an individual,
    Shao Tong, and a private Chinese company, Nanjing Yisike Network
    Safety Technique Co., Ltd. The complaint alleged that two of our
    personal storage disc drive products infringe Chinese patent
    number ZL94111461.9, which prevents the corruption of systems
    data stored on disc drives. The suit, which sought to stop us
    from manufacturing the two products and claimed immaterial
    monetary damages, was dismissed by the court on procedural
    grounds on November 29, 2002. On December 3, 2002, the
    plaintiffs served us with notice that they had refiled the
    lawsuit. The new complaint contains identical infringement
    claims against the same disc drive products, claims immaterial
    monetary damages and attorney’s fees and requests
    injunctive relief and a recall of the products from the Chinese
    market. Manufacture of the accused products ceased in May 2003.
    At a hearing on March 10, 2003, the court referred the
    matter to an independent technical advisory board for a report
    on the application of the patent claims to the two products. On
    June 10, 2003, we presented our non-infringement case to
    the technical panel. The panel issued a technical advisory
    report to the court finding no infringement. The court heard
    oral arguments on the technical advisory report in September
    2003, issued an order that our products do not infringe the
    patent and rejected plaintiffs’ lawsuit. Plaintiffs filed
    an appeal with the Jiangsu High Court, and we filed our
    opposition brief on January 21, 2004. The PRC Patent
    Reexamination Board declared patent ZL94111461.9 invalid on
    March 28, 2004. The Jiangsu High Court stayed the appeal on
    the infringement case pending a final judgment on patent
    invalidity. On June 22, 2004, Shao Tong filed a lawsuit in
    the Beijing Intermediate People’s Court against the PRC PRB
    challenging its patent invalidity decision. On November 29,
    2004, the court affirmed the decision of patent invalidity. In
    December 2004, Shao Tong appealed the decision to the Beijing
    High People’s court, the highest appellate court. On
    November 29, 2004, the court affirmed the decision of
    patent invalidity. In December 2004, Shao Tong appealed the
    decision to the Beijing High People’s Court, the highest
    appellate court, and a hearing was held June 22, 2005. The
    court scheduled a rehearing on December 8, 2005, and
    subsequently reversed the lower court and PRB decisions due to a
    procedural error. The case was remanded to the PRB for further
    action to correct the procedural error. A new PRB panel was
    appointed and the procedural error was corrected and the
    invalidity case reargued at a hearing on May 9, 2006. In
    2006, we filed a second invalidity proceeding with the PRB. On
    June 14, 2007, the PRB issued an order holding the patent
    invalid based on the first invalidity request. The second
    invalidity request was stayed as a result of the ruling on the
    first request. We believe the claims are without merit, and we
    intend to defend against them vigorously.

Papst Licensing, GmbH, Patent Litigation.

As a
    result of the acquisition of Maxtor Corporation, we defended

Siemens, AG.

On August 23, 2006, Siemens,
    AG, a German corporation, filed a complaint against Seagate
    Technology in the U.S. District Court for the Central
    District of California alleging infringement of U.S. Patent
    No. 5,686,838 (the “’838 patent”) entitled
    “Magnetoresistive Sensor Having at Least a Layer System and
    a Plurality of Measuring Contacts Disposed Thereon, and a Method
    of Producing the Sensor.” The suit alleges that Seagate
    drives incorporating Giant Magnetic Resistance (GMR) sensors
    infringe the ’838 patent. The complaint seeks

On January 22, 2007, a lawsuit was filed
    against 11 defendants, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent
    No. 6,805,891, a media patent that is allegedly owned by
    StorMedia Texas LLC. The suit was filed in U.S. District
    Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division. All
    major hard disc drive companies are named, including Seagate
    Technology, Seagate Technology LLC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Samsung,
    Toshiba, and Western Digital, as well as retailers Comp USA,
    J&R Electronics, and Tiger Direct. We served an answer to
    the complaint on April 13, 2007, denying all material
    allegations and asserting affirmative defense. No trial date has
    been set. We intend to vigorously defend the case.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company’s operations inside and outside the United
    States are subject to laws and regulations relating to
    protection of the environment, including those governing the
    discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water, the
    management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and

clean-up

of
    contaminated sites. Contaminants have been detected at some of
    the Company’s current and former sites, principally in
    connection with historical operations. In addition, the Company
    has been named as a potentially responsible party at several
    superfund sites. Investigative activities have taken place at
    all sites of known contamination. One former site is under a
    Consent Order by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
    The extent of the contamination at this site has been
    investigated and defined and remediation is underway. The
    Company is indemnified by a third party for a portion of the
    costs it may incur in the

clean-up

of
    contamination at most sites. In the opinion of management,
    including internal counsel, the probability is remote that the
    losses to the Company arising from these environmental matters
    would be material to the Company’s financial position, cash
    flows or results of operations.

The Company may be subject to various state, federal and
    international laws and regulations governing the environment,
    including those restricting the presence of certain substances
    in electronic products. For example, the European Union
    (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of
    Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
    Equipment (“RoHS”), which prohibits the use of certain
    substances, including lead, in certain products, including hard
    drives, put on the market after July 1, 2006 as well as the
    Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”)
    directive, which makes producers of electrical goods, including
    disc drives, financially responsible for specified collection,
    recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered
    products. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in
    other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada,
    Mexico, China and Japan. The Company will need to ensure that it
    complies with such laws and regulations as they are enacted, and
    that its component suppliers also timely comply with such laws
    and regulations. If the Company fails to timely comply with the
    legislation, its customers may refuse to purchase the
    Company’s products, which would have a materially adverse
    effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Other
    Matters

We are involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
    proceedings incidental to our business, and we may be involved
    in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our
    business in the future. Although occasional adverse decisions or
    settlements may occur, we believe that the final disposition of
    such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position or results of operations.

Acquisitions

Maxtor
    Corporation

On December 20, 2005, the Company entered into an Agreement
    and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with
    Maxtor Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and MD Merger
    Corporation, a Delaware corporation and direct wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Seagate, by which Seagate agreed to acquire Maxtor
    (the “Merger”), and whereby Maxtor would become a
    wholly owned subsidiary of Seagate. On May 19, 2006, the
    Company completed the acquisition of Maxtor in a stock-for-stock
    transaction. The acquisition was structured to qualify as a
    tax-free reorganization and the Company has accounted for the
    acquisition in accordance with SFAS No. 141. The
    purpose of the acquisition was to enhance the Company’s
    scale and capacity to better drive technology advances and
    accelerate delivery of a wide range of differentiated products
    and cost-effective solutions to a growing base of customers.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Maxtor
    common stock was exchanged for 0.37 of Company’s common
    shares. The Company issued approximately 96.9 million
    common shares to Maxtor’s shareholders, assumed and
    converted Maxtor options (based on the 0.37 exchange ratio) into
    options to purchase approximately 7.1 million of the
    Company’s common shares and assumed and converted all
    outstanding Maxtor nonvested stock into approximately
    1.3 million of the Company’s nonvested shares. The
    purchase consideration comprising the fair value of the common
    shares, stock options and nonvested shares assumed and including
    transaction costs was approximately $2.0 billion, excluding
    assumption by the Company of Maxtor’s approximate
    $576 million of outstanding debt obligations.

Purchase
    Price Allocation

The application of purchase accounting under
    SFAS No. 141 requires that the total purchase price be
    allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date, with
    amounts exceeding the fair values being recorded as goodwill.
    The allocation process requires an analysis and valuation of
    acquired assets, including fixed assets, technologies, customer
    contracts and relationships, trade names and liabilities
    assumed, including contractual commitments and legal
    contingencies.

The Company identified and recorded the assets, including
    specifically identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities
    assumed from Maxtor at their estimated fair values as at
    May 19, 2006, the date of acquisition, and allocated the
    residual value of approximately $2.2 billion to goodwill,
    including $297 million of net adjustments recorded during
    fiscal year ended June 29, 2007. These net adjustments
    which reduced goodwill were primarily due to the reversal of
    part of the valuation allowance previously recorded as of the
    acquisition date against certain deferred tax assets comprised
    of former Maxtor operating losses (see Note 4 and
    Note 11).

Determination
    of Fair Values

The Company assigned fair values to all the assets and
    liabilities assumed as of May 19, 2006. For certain
    tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
    the Company utilized the assistance of a third party valuation
    firm in accordance with SFAS No. 141.

Property,
    equipment and leasehold improvements

In general, plant and equipment that was to continue to be used
    was valued at current replacement cost for similar capacity
    while plant and equipment to be sold or held and not used, was
    valued at fair value less cost to sell. Land and buildings were
    valued using the replacement cost approach if they were to
    continue to be used or the

Inventories

The Company allocated $347 million of the purchase price to
    inventories acquired. Finished goods and

work-in-process

inventories were valued based on the Income Method, which is
    based on the projected cash flows derived from selling the
    finished goods inventory, adjusted for costs of disposition and
    the profit commensurate with the amount of investment and degree
    of risk, and in the case of the

work-in-process,

also the expected costs of completion. Raw materials were valued
    based on the Replacement Cost Method. The recorded fair values
    of the inventories have been charged to Cost of Revenue as the
    inventories were sold.

Identifiable
    Intangible Assets Acquired

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the Company
    identified intangible assets apart from goodwill if one of the
    following criteria was met: 1) the asset arises from
    contractual or other legal rights; or 2) the asset is
    capable of being separated or divided from the acquired
    enterprise and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or
    exchanged, either individually or in conjunction with a related
    contract, asset, or liability. The recorded values and estimated

Existing technology relates to Maxtor’s products across all
    of their product lines that have reached technological
    feasibility as well as a combination of Maxtor’s processes,
    patents, and trade secrets developed through years of experience
    in design and development of their products. Existing technology
    was valued using the Excess Earnings Method under the Income
    Approach. This approach reflects the present value of projected
    cash flows that a market participant would expect to generate
    from these technologies less charges related to the contribution
    of other assets to those cash flows. The fair value of the
    existing technology was amortized to Cost of Revenue in fiscal
    year 2007 as the Company phased out the use of these
    technologies and transitioned to Seagate-designed products.

The fair value of customer relationships was determined using
    the Excess Earnings Method under the Income Approach based on
    the estimated revenues to be derived from Maxtor’s OEM,
    distribution and retail customers. This approach reflects the
    present value of projected cash flows that a market participant
    would expect to generate from these customer relationships less
    charges related to the contribution of other assets to those
    cash flows. The fair values of the customer relationships are
    being amortized to Operating Expenses on a straight-line basis
    over the estimated lives of three to four years.



SEAGATE
    TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Trade names reflect the value associated with Maxtor’s
    brand names. Trade names were valued using the
    Relief-from-Royalty Method, a form of the Income Approach, which
    estimates the royalty cost avoided by owning the trade names as
    opposed to having to license them from an independent third
    party. The resulting cash flow savings estimated over the
    remaining useful life of the trade names are then discounted to
    present value to arrive at the fair value allocated to this
    intangible. Trade names are being amortized to Operating
    Expenses over the estimated useful life of four years.

In-Process
    Research and Development

As of the date of the acquisition, all future development
    activities at Maxtor were discontinued. Therefore there were no
    assets that qualified as in-process research and development.

Debt
    Assumed

Upon the closing of the Merger, the Company assumed all of
    Maxtor’s outstanding debt, including Maxtor’s
    convertible senior notes. In addition, upon the closing of the
    Merger, Seagate and Maxtor entered into a supplemental indenture
    whereby the Seagate agreed to unconditionally guarantee the
    notes on a senior unsecured basis (see Note 14).

In accordance with APBO 14, the Company determined the existence
    of substantial premium for both the 2.375% Notes and
    6.8% Notes and recorded the notes at par value with the
    resulting excess over par (the substantial premium) recorded in
    Additional Paid-In Capital included in Shareholders’
    Equity. All other debt was recorded at fair market value.

Adverse/Favorable
    Leasehold Interests

In accordance with the guidance in SFAS No. 141, the
    Company analyzed all contractual leases to determine the fair
    value of the leasehold interests. An adverse leasehold position
    exists when the present value of the contractual rental
    obligation is greater than the present value of the market
    rental obligation, and conversely for a favorable leasehold
    interest. The Company recorded adverse leasehold interests
    totaling $74 million and favorable leasehold interest
    aggregating $4 million, which will be amortized to Cost of
    Revenue and Operating Expenses over the remaining duration of
    the leases.

Recognition
    of Liabilities in Connection with Maxtor Acquisition

Under EITF

95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Business
    Combination,

the Company has accrued certain exit costs
    aggregating $247 million, of which $108 million
    relates to employee severance, $45 million relates to the
    planned exit of leased or owned excess facilities and
    $94 million relates to the cancellation or settlement of
    contractual obligations that will not provide any future
    economic benefit. The severance and associated benefits
    liability relates to the employment termination of approximately
    4,900 Maxtor employees, primarily in the U.S. and Far East,
    all of whom had been terminated as of June 29, 2007. In the

    was approximately $69 million, net of forfeitures, of which
    approximately $44 million has been amortized through
    June 29, 2007. The remaining $25 million is being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated
    service (vesting) periods of the underlying stock options or
    nonvested shares.

Pro
    Forma Financial Information

The unaudited financial information in the table below
    summarizes the combined results of operations of the Company and
    the results of Maxtor prior to the Merger, on a pro forma basis,
    as though the companies had been combined as of July 3,
    2004 for each period presented. Pro forma financial information
    for our other acquisitions have not been presented, as the
    effects were not material to our historical consolidated
    financial statements either individually or in aggregate. The
    pro forma financial information for all periods presented also
    includes the business combination accounting effect on
    conforming Maxtor’s revenue recognition policy to the
    Company’s, adjustments related to the fair value of
    acquired inventory and fixed assets, amortization charges from
    acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation charges for
    unvested options assumed and nonvested shares exchanged and
    related tax effects of these adjustments. The pro forma
    financial information is presented for informational purposes
    only and is not indicative of the results of operations that
    would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at
    the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor does it
    intend to be a projection of future results.

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 2006 combines the Company’s
    historical results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006
    and, due to differences in our reporting periods, the historical
    results of Maxtor for the period from July 3, 2005 to
    May 19, 2006. The unaudited pro forma financial information
    for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2005 combines the

EVault,
    Inc.

In order to expand its current product and service offerings, in
    January 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of EVault in
    an all cash transaction valued at approximately
    $186 million, which included approximately $2 million
    in estimated acquisition-related expenses. EVault provides data
    storage services for small to medium size businesses, including
    online backup, data protection and recovery solutions.

The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to the
    tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    based on their respective estimated fair values on the
    acquisition date as follows (in millions):

    liabilities assumed

Tangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying
    amounts as the Company believes that these amounts approximated
    their current fair values at the acquisition dates. The fair
    value of identifiable intangible assets acquired reflects
    management’s estimates based on, among other factors, use
    of established valuation methods. Such assets consist of
    existing technology, customer relationships and trade names.
    Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their
    estimated remaining useful lives. The Company assigned
    $4 million to the value of EVault’s in-process
    research and development projects as at the acquisition date,
    all of which was written off in the period of acquisition.
    Goodwill of approximately $122 million represents the
    excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
    tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The EVault
    acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    results of operations.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the Company allocated
    the excess of the cost of the acquired entities over the net
    amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill.
    As at June 29, 2007, the composition of the amounts
    recorded to goodwill are as follows (in millions):

In accordance with the guidance in SFAS No. 142,
    goodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment
    on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of
    circumstances that indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The
    Company did not record any impairment of goodwill during fiscal
    years 2007 and 2006.

Other
    Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets consist primarily of existing
    technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in
    business combinations. Acquired intangibles are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives
    of the assets. The carrying value of intangible assets at
    June 29, 2007 is set forth in the table below. The net
    carrying value of intangible assets at June 29, 2007 and
    June 30, 2006 was $188 million and $307 million,
    respectively. Accumulated amortization of intangibles was
    $185 million and $33 million at June 29, 2007 and
    June 30, 2006, respectively.

    technology intangible is charged to Cost of revenue while the
    amortization of the other intangible assets is included in
    Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    During the year ended June 29, 2007, the Company recorded a
    write-off of in-process research and development related to the
    acquisition of EVault in the amount of $4 million, which is
    included in Product development in the Consolidated Statements
    of Operations. Aggregate annual amortization of other intangible
    assets, based on their current estimated lives, is estimated to
    be $90 million, $58 million, $34 million,
    $6 million and less than $1 million for fiscal years
    2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Guarantees

Indemnifications
    to Officers and Directors

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements, a form
    of which is incorporated by reference in the exhibits of this
    report, with the members of our board of directors to indemnify
    them to the extent permitted by law against any and all
    liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in settlement and
    damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit, or
    any judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding in
    which the directors are sued as a result of their service as
    members of our board of directors.

Intellectual
    Property Indemnification Obligations

The Company has entered into agreements with customers and
    suppliers that include limited intellectual property
    indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry.
    These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the
    other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result
    of third party intellectual property claims arising from these
    transactions. The nature of the intellectual property
    indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a
    reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be
    required to pay to its customers and suppliers. Historically,
    the Company has not made any significant indemnification
    payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect
    to these indemnification obligations.

Product
    Warranty

The Company estimates probable product warranty costs at the
    time revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its
    products for a period of one to five years. The Company uses
    estimated repair or replacement costs and uses statistical
    modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine
    its warranty obligation. In addition, estimated settlements for
    customer compensatory claims relating product quality issues, if
    any, are accrued as warranty expense. Changes in the
    Company’s product warranty liability during the fiscal
    years ended June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006 were as

SAC. The services provided generally include general management,
    treasury, tax, financial reporting, benefits administration,
    insurance, information technology, legal, accounts payable and
    receivable and credit functions, among others. The Company
    charged for these services through corporate expense
    allocations. The amount of corporate expense allocations
    depended upon the total amount of allocable costs incurred by
    the Company on behalf of the affiliated company less amounts
    charged as specified cost or expense rather than by allocation.
    Such costs have been proportionately allocated to the affiliated
    companies based on detailed inquiries and estimates of time
    incurred by the Company’s corporate marketing and general
    administrative departmental managers. Management believes that
    the allocations charged to other affiliated companies were
    reasonable. There were no allocations charged to other
    affiliated companies’ marketing and administrative expenses
    for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, and these allocations were not
    material for fiscal year 2005. Xiotech Corporation and Certance
    were affiliates of Seagate Technology. The Company recorded
    revenue from Xiotech of $1 million, $1 million and
    $7 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, and recorded revenue from Certance of
    $2 million for the period from July 3, 2004 through
    January 2005, at which time it was sold to a third party. There
    were no amounts receivable from affiliated companies at
    June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006. Purchases and sales
    to other affiliated companies were not material for any of the
    periods presented.

    SAC no longer owns any of the Company’s common shares.

14.  Condensed
    Consolidating Financial Information

The Company has guaranteed HDD’s obligations under the 2009
    Notes, the 2011 Notes and the 2016 Notes (the “Senior
    Notes”), on a full and unconditional basis, and prior to
    October 25, 2006 when the Company’s 8% Notes were
    redeemed, the Company had guaranteed HDD’s obligations
    under the 8% Notes. The following tables present parent
    guarantor, subsidiary issuer and combined non-guarantors
    condensed consolidating balance sheets of the Company and its
    subsidiaries at June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006, the
    condensed consolidating statements of operations and cash flows
    for the fiscal years ended June 29, 2007, June 30,
    2006 and July 1, 2005. The information classifies the
    Company’s subsidiaries into Seagate Technology-parent
    company guarantor, HDD-subsidiary issuer, and the Combined
    Non-Guarantors based upon the classification of those
    subsidiaries. Under each of these instruments, dividends paid by
    HDD or its restricted subsidiaries would constitute restricted
    payments and loans between the Company and HDD or its restricted
    subsidiaries would constitute affiliate transactions.

From the date of acquisition (May 19, 2006) through
    June 30, 2006, Maxtor was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary
    of Seagate Technology. The accompanying condensed consolidating
    balance sheet as of June 30, 2006 reflects the corporate
    legal structure of Seagate Technology, HDD, and the Combined
    Non-Guarantors, as they existed at that time. On July 3,
    2006, through a corporate organizational change and realignment,
    Maxtor became a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of HDD and of
    Seagate Technology. As a result, beginning July 3, 2006,
    the investment in Maxtor is accounted for on an equity method
    basis in the financial information of HDD. Certain intercompany
    balances have been reclassified to conform to the current
    presentation.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On May 19, 2006, in connection with the acquisition of
    Maxtor, the Company, Maxtor and the trustee under the indenture
    for the 2.375% Notes and 6.8% Notes entered into a
    supplemental indenture pursuant to which the notes became
    convertible into the Company’s common shares. In addition,
    the Company agreed to fully and unconditionally guarantee the
    2.375% Notes and 6.8% Notes on a senior unsecured
    basis. The Company’s obligations under its guarantee rank
    in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior
    unsecured indebtedness. The indenture does not contain any
    financial covenants and does not restrict Maxtor from paying
    dividends, incurring additional indebtedness or issuing or
    repurchasing its other securities (see Note 5). The
    following tables present parent guarantor, subsidiary issuer and
    combined non-guarantors condensed consolidating balance sheets
    of the Company and its subsidiaries at June 29, 2007 and
    June 30, 2006, the condensed consolidating statements of
    operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended
    June 29, 2007 and the period from May 19, 2006 to
    June 30, 2006. The information classifies the
    Company’s subsidiaries into Seagate Technology-parent
    company guarantor, Maxtor-subsidiary issuer and the Combined
    Non-Guarantors based on the classification of those subsidiaries
    under the terms of the 2.375% Notes and 6.8% Notes.

From the date of acquisition (May 19, 2006) through
    June 30, 2006, Maxtor was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary
    of Seagate Technology. The accompanying condensed consolidating
    balance sheet as of June 30, 2006 reflects the corporate
    legal structure of Seagate Technology, HDD, and the Combined
    Non-Guarantors, as they existed at that time. On July 3,
    2006, through a corporate organizational change and realignment,
    Maxtor became a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of HDD and of
    Seagate Technology. As a result, beginning July 3, 2006,
    the investment in Maxtor is accounted for on an equity method
    basis in the financial information of HDD, a non-guarantor, and
    therefore, the balance sheet of the Combined Non-Guarantors as
    of June 29, 2007 reflects the investment in Maxtor on an
    equity method basis. Certain intercompany balances have been
    reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Seagate Technology

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Seagate Technology as of June 29, 2007 and June 30,
    2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity and cash flows of Seagate Technology
    for the fiscal years ended June 29, 2007, June 30,
    2006 and July 1, 2005. These consolidated financial
    statements are the responsibility of Seagate Technology’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
    consolidated financial position of Seagate Technology at
    June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006 and the consolidated
    results of its operations and cash flows for the fiscal years
    ended June 29, 2007, June 30, 2006 and July 1,
    2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Seagate Technology’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of June 29, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated August 21, 2007 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, under the heading Compensation —
    Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), in fiscal 2006 Seagate
    Technology changed its method of accounting for stock-based
    compensation.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Seagate Technology

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting, that Seagate Technology maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    June 29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
    criteria). Seagate Technology’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Seagate
    Technology maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of June 29, 2007, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
    opinion, Seagate Technology maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of June 29, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2007 consolidated financial statements of Seagate Technology and
    our report dated August 21, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Conclusions
    Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have
    concluded, based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by our
    management, with the participation of our chief executive
    officer and our chief financial officer, that our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of June 29, 2007.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Under
    the supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission, or COSO.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, our management has
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of June 29, 2007. Our management’s
    assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of June 29, 2007 has been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included
    herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations
    on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
    and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
    Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
    that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our
    disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls
    have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
    their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all
    control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within Seagate have been detected. An evaluation was
    performed under the supervision and with the participation of
    our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    June 29, 2007. Based on that evaluation, our management,
    including our chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
