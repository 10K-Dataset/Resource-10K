PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

We are a leader in the design, manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc
drives. Rigid disc drives, which are commonly referred to as hard drives, are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop computers and consumer electronics to data centers delivering information
over corporate networks and the Internet. We produce a broad range of rigid disc drive products that make us a leader in both the enterprise sector of our industry, where our products are primarily used in enterprise servers, mainframes and
workstations, and the personal storage sector of our industry, where our products are used in PCs and consumer electronics. We have also recently introduced new products for the mobile sector, where our rigid disc drives are used in notebook
computers.

We are committed to a long-term strategic plan
developed in 1998 which involves ownership of critical component technologies, a commitment to advanced research and development and a focus on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency and flexibility. This long-term plan involves:

•

increasing our commitment to investment in fundamental research and technological innovation;

•

leveraging our research investment to bring new products to market, such as our notebook rigid disc drives;

•

instituting common technology platforms throughout our product portfolio to allow us to efficiently leverage our component technology advancements across multiple products;

•

streamlining our operations by rationalizing our manufacturing processes to eliminate redundant facilities, focusing on strategic competencies and enhancing our supply chain
management;

•

continuing to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes through our “Factory of the Future” initiative; and

•

realizing the benefits of our Six Sigma quality management program.

We sell our rigid disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, with whom we have longstanding relationships. These customers include Dell,
EMC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Sun Microsystems. We also have key relationships with major distributors, who sell our rigid disc drive products to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world.


Industry

Demand for Electronic Data Storage

We believe that the amount of data stored and accessed electronically is growing rapidly and that there are a number of key factors driving this demand,
including:

•

the continuing expansion of the Internet as a medium for information technology infrastructure related to business management, for broadband communication and for entertainment,
particularly music and video;

•

the widespread adoption of enterprise software applications, such as supply chain management, customer relationship management, enterprise resource management and data warehousing;

•

a broader deployment of information storage systems that allow rapid recovery of data following a disaster and that increase data availability to end users by creating multiple
distributed copies; and

•

the continuing growth in software applications, such as databases and computer aided design programs, used by individuals and small groups that are delivered over a network from
shared data servers.

Rigid disc drives are the primary devices
used for storing, managing and protecting the electronic data associated with all of these applications.

We are particularly focused on three areas of growing demand for rigid disc drives:

Growth in Rigid Disc Drives for Consumer Electronics

. High-performance computing and communications functions and,
increasingly, rigid disc drives are being incorporated into consumer electronics such as video game consoles, including Microsoft’s Xbox, digital video recorders and advanced television set-top boxes. In addition, faster connections to the
Internet and increased broadband capacity have encouraged consumers to download greater amounts of text, video and audio data, expanding the market for rigid disc drives for use in new consumer and entertainment appliances. The adoption and rapid
growth of the use of rigid disc drives in these applications will be facilitated by the development of low-cost rigid disc drives that meet the pricing requirements of the consumer electronics market.

Growth in Rigid Disc Drives for Notebook Computers.

The notebook
computer market is expected to grow faster than any other PC segment as performance and price continue to improve, placing notebooks in an attractive position relative to desktop computers. Notebook systems are increasingly becoming replacement
systems to desktop PCs and progressively more desirable to consumers as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance. In addition, the industry continually progresses towards smaller systems and devices.

Growth of Storage Area Networks and Network Attached Storage

. The need
to address the dramatic expansion in data storage management requirements has spurred the evolution of new storage and data management technologies. Enterprises are increasingly offloading network traffic to dedicated storage area networks, or SANs.
In addition, many enterprises are moving away from the use of server-attached storage to network-attached storage, or NAS. These solutions combine high-performance storage products that are comprised principally of rigid disc drives with
sophisticated software and communications technologies. We expect that the market for these solutions will grow rapidly and will result in greater opportunities for the sale of high-performance, high-capacity rigid disc drives.

Success in Our Industry Depends on Technology and Manufacturing
Leadership

The design and manufacturing of rigid disc
drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques, especially in the areas of read/write heads and recording media. Rigid disc drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of integration, which is the degree to which
they control the technology used in their products, and by whether they are captive, producing rigid disc drives for their own computer systems, or independent. Integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical
technologies, including read/write heads and recording media, used in their rigid disc drives. An integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently. In
contrast, manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from third-party suppliers, upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation. This can limit their ability to coordinate
technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers. Independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive
advantage over captive manufacturers in working with original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, because they do not compete with OEMs for computer system sales.


Due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing
efficiency, the rigid disc drive industry continues to undergo significant consolidation as manufacturers and merchant component suppliers merge with other companies or exit the industry. For instance, IBM recently combined its rigid disc drive
business with that of Hitachi. Consolidation is likely to continue in our industry as the technological challenges and the associated levels of required investment grow, increasing the competitive necessity of large-scale operations. We believe the
competitive dynamics of the rigid disc drive industry favor integrated, independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers.

Overview of Rigid Disc Drive Technology

All rigid disc drives incorporate the same basic technology although
individual products vary. One or more rigid discs are attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub. The discs, or recording media, are the components on which data is stored
and from which it is retrieved. Each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a thin-film magnetic material. Read/write heads, mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record
player, fly extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating discs. The read/write heads are mounted vertically on an e-shaped assembly. The e-block and the
recording media are mounted inside a metal casing, called the base casting.

Upon instructions from the drive’s electronic circuitry, a head positioning mechanism, or actuator, guides the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved. Application specific
integrated circuits, or ASICs, and ancillary electronic control chips are collectively mounted on printed circuit boards. ASICs move data to and from the read/write head and the internal controller, or interface, which communicates with the host
computer. Rigid disc drive manufacturers typically use one or more of several industry standard interfaces such as advanced technology architecture, or ATA, small computer system interface, or SCSI, and Fibre Channel. Recently a new standard, Serial
ATA, has been introduced. Serial ATA provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ATA standard.

Rigid disc drive performance is commonly assessed by five key characteristics:

•

storage capacity, commonly expressed in megabytes, gigabytes or terabytes, which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disc;

•

spindle rotation speed, commonly expressed in revolutions per minute, which has an effect on speed of access to data;

•

interface transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data moves between the rigid disc drive and the computer controller;

•

average seek time, commonly expressed in milliseconds, which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disc surface; and

•

media data transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disc.

Areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the
recording surface of a disc. Current areal densities are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today. We expect, however, the long-term demand for increased drive capacities to continue to grow as audio and visual data require
many multiples of the storage capacity of simple text. We have pursued, and expect to continue to pursue, a range of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase drive capacities and to allow the
elimination of components at a stated capacity as areal density increases, thus reducing costs.


Manufacturing

We pursue an integrated business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies. This strategy allows us to maintain control over our
product roadmap and component cost, quality and availability. Our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility is a critical element of our integrated business strategy. During the past several years we have made significant improvements in our
manufacturing efficiency by:

•

consolidating the number of facilities we operate and reducing the number of personnel we employ;

•

expanding manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency and flexibility through our Factory of the Future initiative;

•

applying Six Sigma to improve product quality and reliability and reduce costs;

•

integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements; and

•

coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and enhance our product quality and reliability.

Manufacturing our rigid disc drives is a complex process that
begins with the production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit. We design, assemble and/or manufacture a number of the most important components found in our rigid disc drives, including read/write heads, recording media,
printed circuit boards, spindle motors and ASICs.

Read/Write Heads

. The function of the read/write head is to scan across the disc as it spins, magnetically recording or reading information. The tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require state-of-the-art
equipment and processes. Our read/write heads are manufactured with thin-film and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits. Beginning with six inch round ceramic wafers, we process more than
25,000 head elements at one time. Each of these head elements goes through more than 300 steps, all in clean room environments. Our read/write heads require highly advanced processes with tolerances approaching the thickness of a single atom. We
perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of read/write heads at our facilities. Although the percentage of our requirements for read/write heads that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter, we currently manufacture almost
all of our read/write heads.

Recording Media

. The
function of the recording media is to magnetically store information. The domains where each bit of magnetic code is stored are extremely small and precisely placed. As a result, the manufacturing of recording media requires sophisticated thin-film
processes. Each disc is a sequentially processed set of layers that consist of structural, magnetic, protective and lubricating materials. Once complete, the disc must have a high degree of physical uniformity to assure reliable and error-free
storage. We purchase aluminum substrate blanks for recording media production from third parties, mainly in Japan. These blanks are machined, plated and polished to produce finished substrates at our plant in Northern Ireland. Although the
percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter, we currently manufacture almost all of our recording media requirements. We plan to expand our media production facility in Singapore
during fiscal year 2004 to further increase our production capacity. Our strategy is to purchase no more than 20% of our recording media requirements from third-party suppliers in any given quarter.

Printed Circuit Boards

. We assemble and test a significant portion of
the printed circuit boards used in our rigid disc drives. Printed circuit boards are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and ASICs that provide the electronic controls of the rigid disc drive and on which the head-disc assembly is
mounted. We assemble printed circuit boards at our facilities in Malaysia and Singapore.

Spindle Motors

. We design most of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from outside vendors in Asia, whom we have licensed to use our intellectual property and technology.

ASICs

. We participate in the design of many of the ASICs used in our
rigid disc drives for motor and actuator control, such as interface controllers, read/write channels and pre-amplifiers. We do not manufacture any ASICs but, rather, buy them from third-party suppliers.


Following the production of the individual components of the rigid disc drive, the first step in the
manufacture of a rigid disc drive itself is the assembly of the actuator arm, read/write heads, discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the head-disc assembly. The production of the head-disc assembly involves largely automated processes.
Printed circuit boards are then mated to the head-disc assembly and the completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment. Final assembly and test operations of our rigid disc drives occur primarily at facilities located in China and
Singapore. We perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Thailand and, in the United States, in California and Minnesota. In addition, third parties manufacture and assemble
components for us in various Asian countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, and in Europe and the United States.

Products

We offer a broad range of 3.5-inch form factor rigid disc drive products for both the enterprise and desktop sectors of the rigid disc drive industry. We
also recently introduced the Momentus family of 2.5-inch rigid disc drives for notebooks. We offer more than one product within each product family, and differentiate products on the basis of price/performance and form factor, or the dimensions of
the rigid disc drive. Because of rapid advancements in rigid disc drive technology, product life cycles have been as short as six months. To address this issue, we introduce new products and enhancements to our product families as we develop new
technology. We list in the table below our main rigid disc drive products.

Barracuda
Family

. Commercial uses for Barracuda rigid disc drives include workstations, mainframes and supercomputers, network file servers, digital audio and video image processing and high-performance desktop PCs.

Cheetah Family

. Commercial uses for Cheetah rigid disc drives include
Internet and e-commerce servers, data mining and data warehousing, mainframes and supercomputers, department/enterprise servers and workstations, transaction processing, professional video and graphics and medical imaging.

U-Series Family

. Commercial uses for
the U-Series rigid disc drives include entry-level desktop PCs running popular office applications, entry-level PCs for government and education environments and desktop PCs connected to a mainframe server. Consumer uses for the U-Series family
include entry-level PCs, home PCs purchased as second or third systems and discounted PCs sold in conjunction with an Internet service provider or other service provider. The U-Series family of rigid disc drives are also used in new markets,
including television set-top boxes, printers, copiers and arcade and other dedicated gaming uses. Recently, we introduced our U Series X rigid disc drives for consumer electronics applications utilizing a single read/write head and a thinner profile
in order to lower cost, improve performance and increase durability.


Barracuda ATA Family

. Commercial and consumer uses for the Barracuda ATA family include desktop
PCs used in businesses and consumer PCs used for gaming, other entertainment applications, digital photo and video editing, viewing and capturing television images and advanced spreadsheet modeling and graphics.

Momentus Family.

Momentus is our introductory notebook rigid disc
drive product. With its 5400 RPM rotation speed, the Momentus rigid disc drives target only a portion of the notebook segment. Commercial uses for Momentus rigid disc drives include notebook PCs running popular office applications and laptops for
business, government and education environments. Consumer uses for Momentus rigid disc drives include home notebook PCs, tablet PCs and digital audio applications.

Customers

We sell our rigid disc drive products primarily to major OEMs and distributors. OEM customers incorporate our rigid disc drives into computer systems and
storage systems for resale. Distributors typically sell our rigid disc drives to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and other resellers. Shipments to OEMs were approximately 61% and 66% of our revenue in fiscal years 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Shipments to distributors were approximately 39% and 34% of our revenue in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. In May 2002, Hewlett-Packard completed its acquisition of Compaq. Sales to Hewlett-Packard accounted for approximately
18% of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal year 2003. Sales to Hewlett-Packard and Compaq together accounted for approximately 20% of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal year 2002. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our rigid disc
drive revenue in fiscal years 2003 and 2002. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Dependence on Key Customers.”

OEM customers typically enter into master purchase agreements
with us. These agreements provide for pricing, volume discounts, order lead times, product support obligations and other terms and conditions. The term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36 months, although our product support obligations
generally extend substantially beyond this period. These master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products, or create exclusive relationships. Deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase
orders. In addition, with limited lead time, customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or OEM delivery schedules have been
deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs.

Our distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements for the redistribution of our products. They typically furnish us with a non-binding indication of their near-term requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled
based on a weekly confirmation by the distributor of its requirements for that week. The agreements typically provide the distributors with price protection with respect to their inventory of our rigid disc drives at the time of a reduction by us in
our selling price for the rigid disc drives and also provide limited rights to return the product.

We also regularly enter into agreements with our customers which obligate us to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual
property claims. These agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customer against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of
our products.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales organization focuses on deepening our relationship with our
customers. As of June 27, 2003, our sales organization included approximately 391 employees, who are divided into two groups. The global OEM sales group focuses on our key worldwide OEM customers. The worldwide sales group focuses on geographic
coverage of OEMs and distributors throughout most of the world. The worldwide sales group is organized regionally among the United States, Japan, Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) and Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In addition, we have a sales
operations group which focuses on aligning our production levels with customers’ product requirements. Our sales force works directly with our marketing organization to coordinate our OEM and distribution channel relationships. We maintain
sales offices throughout the United States and in Australia, China, England, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan.

Our marketing organization works to increase demand for our rigid disc drive products through strategic collaboration with key OEM customers to align our
respective product roadmaps and to build our brand and end-customer relationships. As of June 27, 2003, our marketing organization had approximately 252 employees. This organization is comprised of our strategic marketing, business development and
marketing communications groups. Our strategic marketing group coordinates with our research and development group to align our product development roadmap to meet key OEM customers’ technology requirements over the long term. Our business
development group coordinates the qualification of new products with OEMs, determines product pricing and provides product service and support. Our marketing communications group focuses on building the Seagate brand name among our OEM and
distribution channel customers.


Foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other restrictions, including, in the case of
some countries, approval by the Office of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce and other U.S. governmental agencies.

Competition

The rigid disc drive industry is intensely competitive, with manufacturers competing for a limited number of major customers. A significant portion of our
recent success is a result of our increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors. Our current market share may be negatively affected by our customers’ preference to diversify their sources of supply or if they decide to meet
their requirements by manufacturing rigid disc drives themselves, particularly in the enterprise sector. Maintaining or improving market share is fundamental to succeeding in our industry, and any significant increase in market share by one of our
competitors would likely result in a decline in our market share. Some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among rigid disc drive manufacturers are:

•

storage capacity;

•

price per unit and price per megabyte;

•

storage/retrieval access times;

•

data transfer rates;

•

product quality and reliability;

•

production volume capability;

•

form factor; and

•

responsiveness to customer preferences and demands.

We believe that our products are generally competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address. We summarize below our principal
competitors, the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology.

Principal Competitors

. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign
companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have. These competitors include other independent rigid disc drive manufacturers such as Maxtor and Western Digital, as well as large captive manufacturers such as Fujitsu,
Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Samsung and Toshiba. Because they produce complete computer systems, captive manufacturers can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components, which reduces their need to realize a
profit on the rigid disc drives included in their computer systems and allows them to sell rigid disc drives to third parties at very low margins. Many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial
resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do. We also face indirect competition from present and potential customers, who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own rigid disc drives and other information
storage products or purchase them from outside sources other than us. These manufacturers also sell rigid disc drives to third parties, which results in direct competition with us. We expect that continued consolidation both among independent
manufacturers and among captive manufacturers will increase the threat posed to our business by these competitors.

Price Erosion

. Our competitors have historically offered new or existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market
share and customers, and we expect these practices to continue. Even during periods when demand for rigid disc drives is stable, our industry is price competitive and vendors experience price erosion over the life of a product, and such price
erosion can be expected to increase to the extent product life cycles lengthen. Based on our recent experience in the industry with new product introductions, we believe that the rate of increase in areal density is slowing from its previous levels.
This trend may contribute to increases in average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue, product life cycles are lengthened and we are unable to offset this with new products at higher average prices. We expect
that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future. To remain competitive, we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce our prices. We established production facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand to
achieve cost reductions.


Product Life Cycles and Changing Technology

. Historically, competition and changing customer
preference and demand in the rigid disc drive industry have shortened product life cycles and caused an acceleration in the development and introduction of new technology. Based on the recent pace of new product introductions, however, we believe
that the rate of increase in areal density has slowed, and the resulting variability in product life cycles may make planning for product transitions more difficult, particularly in the personal storage sector of our industry. We believe that our
future success will depend upon our ability to develop, manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability which meet changing user needs and which successfully anticipate or respond to changes in technology and standards on a
cost-effective and timely basis.

Research and Development

We believe that our success depends on our ability to develop products
that meet changing user needs and to anticipate and respond to changes in technology on a cost-effective and timely basis. Accordingly, we are committed to developing new component technologies and products and to continually evaluating alternative
technologies. During fiscal years 2002 and 2003, we had product development expenses of $698 million and $670 million, respectively.

We have increased our focus on research and development and realigned our rigid disc drive development process. This structured product process is
designed to bring new products to market through predictable and repeatable methodologies. In 1998, we established Seagate Research based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which is dedicated to extending the capacity of magnetic and optical recording and
exploring alternative data storage technologies, including perpendicular recording technology and heat assisted magnetic recording technology. Perpendicular recording technology involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is
currently used in rigid disc drives, and heat assisted magnetic recording technology uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity. In fiscal year 1998, we established our Advanced Concepts Laboratory, which focuses rigid disc drive and
component research on recording subsystems, including read/write heads and recording media, market-specific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities. The primary purpose of our Advanced Concepts Laboratory
is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies across our products.

Patents and Licenses

As of June 27, 2003, we had approximately 2,087 U.S. patents and 723 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well
as approximately 1,383 U.S. and 1,561 foreign patent applications pending. The number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity. Due to the rapid technological change
that characterizes the information storage industry, we believe that the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secret law, the protection of unpatented proprietary know-how and development of new products are generally more important
than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, we believe that patents are valuable to our business and intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents, where available, in connection with our research
and development program.

The information storage industry is
characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. Because of rapid technological development in the information storage industry, some of our products have been, and in the future could be, alleged to
infringe existing patents of third parties. From time to time, we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties. Although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights
under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us, other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements. In addition, other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations. For more information on these claims, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” The costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation may be substantial regardless of the merit of the claim or the
outcome. We have patent cross-licenses with a number of companies. Additionally, as part of our normal intellectual property practices, we are engaged in negotiations with other major rigid disc drive companies and component manufacturers with
respect to ongoing patent cross-licenses. For a discussion of the related risks, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business—Potential Loss of Licensed Technology.”

Backlog

In view of customers’ rights to cancel or defer
orders with little or no penalty, we believe backlog in the rigid disc drive industry may be of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results. Our backlog includes only those orders for which the customer has specified a
delivery schedule. Because many customers place large orders for delivery throughout the year, and because of the possibility of customer cancellation of orders or changes in delivery schedules, our backlog as of any particular date is not
indicative of our potential sales for any succeeding fiscal period. Our order backlog at June 27, 2003 was approximately $1.176 billion.


Employees

At June 27, 2003, we employed approximately 43,000 persons worldwide, of which approximately 33,000 employees were located in our Asian operations. In
addition, we make use of temporary employees, principally in manufacturing, who are hired on an as-needed basis. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels, and even
then we cannot assure you of any such success. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to comprehensive U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of
hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and
revocation by issuing authorities.

We believe that our
operations are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental laws, regulations and permits. We incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are
imposed on us in the future, we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures.

Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal superfund law and similar state statutes, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated
sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the
original disposal activity. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites. At each of these sites, the government has assigned to us a portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of
hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties.

Some of our current and former sites have a history of commercial and industrial operations, including the use of hazardous substances. Groundwater and
soil contamination resulting from historical operations has been identified at several of our current and former facilities and we are addressing the cleanup of these sites in cooperation with the relevant government agencies.

While our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to
predict with complete accuracy, based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs, we do not expect costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements relating to our legal proceedings described below. Litigation
is inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Intellectual Property Litigation

Convolve, Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) v. Seagate Technology LLC, et al.

Between 1998 and 1999, Convolve, Inc.,
a small privately held technology consulting firm founded by an MIT Ph.D., engaged in discussions with Seagate Delaware with respect to the potential license of technology that Convolve claimed to own. During that period, the parties entered into
non-disclosure agreements. We declined Convolve’s offer of a license in late 1999. On July 13, 2000, Convolve and MIT filed suit against Compaq Computer Corporation and us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
alleging patent infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and fraud relating to Convolve and MIT’s Input Shaping

®

and Convolve’s Quick and Quiet

™

technology. The plaintiffs claim their technology is incorporated in our sound barrier technology, which was publicly
announced on June 6, 2000. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, $800 million in compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages. We answered the complaint on August 2, 2000 and filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment that two
Convolve/MIT patents are invalid and not infringed and that we own any intellectual property based on the information that we disclosed to Convolve. The court denied plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery and ordered plaintiffs to identify
their trade secrets to defendants before discovery could begin. Convolve served a trade secrets disclosure on August 4, 2000, and we filed a motion challenging the disclosure statement. On May 3, 2001, the court appointed a special master to review
the trade secret issues. The special master resigned on June 5, 2001, and the court appointed another special master on July 26, 2001. After a hearing on our motion challenging the trade secrets disclosure on September 21, 2001, the special master
issued a report and recommendation to the court that the trade secret list was insufficient. Convolve revised the trade secret list, and the court entered an order on January 1, 2002, accepting the special master’s recommendation that this
trade secret list was adequate. On November 6, 2001, the USPTO issued US Patent No. 6,314,473 to Convolve. Convolve filed an amended complaint on January 16, 2002, alleging defendants’ infringement of this patent, and we answered and filed
counterclaims on February 8, 2002. Discovery is in process. On July 26, 2002, we filed a Rule 11 motion challenging the adequacy of plaintiffs’ pre-filing investigation on the first two patents alleged in the complaint and seeking dismissal of
plaintiffs’ claims related to these patents and reimbursement of attorney’s fees. The court denied our motion on May 23, 2003. Briefing on claims construction issues has been completed and a claims construction (Markman) hearing has been
requested. No trial date has been set. We believe that the claims are without merit, and we intend to defend against them vigorously. On May 6, 2003, the USPTO issued to Convolve U.S. Patent No. 6,560,658 B2, entitled “Data Storage Device with
Quick and Quiet Modes.” Convolve has indicated that it will seek leave of the court to add this patent to the lawsuit. This latest patent is a continuation of a patent currently in the lawsuit (U.S. Patent No. 6,314,473). We similarly believe
any claims that may relate to this continuation patent would be without merit, regardless of whether such claims were added to the ongoing litigation or asserted against us in a separate lawsuit. Judge John Martin, who was assigned to this case, has
announced his retirement from the federal bench. We have been informed that the case has been assigned to Judge George B. Daniels.

Shao Tong, et al. v. Seagate International (Wuxi) Co., Ltd

. In July 2002, we were sued in the People’s Court of Nanjing City, China, by an
individual, Shao Tong, and a private Chinese company, Nanjing Yisike Network Safety Technique Co., Ltd. The complaint alleged that two of our personal storage disc drive products infringe Chinese patent number ZL94111461.9, which prevents the
corruption of systems data stored on rigid disc drives. The suit, which sought to stop us from manufacturing the two products and claimed immaterial monetary damages, was dismissed by the court on procedural grounds on November 29, 2002. On December
3, 2002, the plaintiffs served us with notice that they had refiled the lawsuit. The new complaint contains identical infringement claims against the same disc drive products, claims immaterial monetary damages and attorney’s fees and requests
injunctive relief and a recall of the products from the Chinese market. Manufacture of the accused products ceased in May 2003. At a hearing on March 10, 2003, the court referred the matter to an independent technical advisory board for a report on
the application of the patent claims to the two products. On June 10, 2003, we presented our non-infringement case to the technical panel. The panel issued a technical advisory report to the court finding no infringement. The court has set a hearing
on the technical advisory report for August 21, 2003. We believe the claims are without merit, and we intend to defend against them vigorously.

Seagate Technology v. Read-Rite Corporation.

In order to clarify our rights under a patent cross-license agreement that Seagate Delaware entered
into with Read-Rite Corporation as of December 31, 1994, we filed a declaratory judgment action on May 7, 2003 in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, seeking a declaration that we are entitled to a cross-license, effective as of
November 22, 2000, under terms substantially identical to those contained in the original Patent Cross License Agreement. On June 11, 2003, Read-Rite Corporation answered the complaint putting forward a general denial and asserting various
affirmative defenses. On June 17, 2003, Read-Rite Corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon notice, our declaratory judgment action has been stayed. On July 23, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court approved the bid of Western Digital Corporation to acquire the assets of Read-Rite Corporation, including the intellectual property that was the subject of Read-Rite’s dispute with us, in a transaction that closed on July 31, 2003.


Other Matters

We are involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to our business, and we may be
involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business in the future. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or results of operations.

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

Market Information

Our common shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “STX” since December 11, 2002. Prior
to that time there was no public market for our common shares. The high and low sales prices of our common shares, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.

The closing price of
our common shares as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on August 15, 2003 was $20.70 per share. As of August 15, 2003 there were approximately 1,041 holders of record of our common shares. There were no sales of our equity securities during
fiscal year 2003 that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

Dividends

On June 27, 2003, our board of
directors amended our quarterly dividend policy and, pursuant to our amended policy, we expect to pay our shareholders a quarterly distribution of up to $0.04 per share ($0.16 annually) so long as the aggregate amount of the distribution does not
exceed 50% of our consolidated net income for the quarter in which the distribution is declared, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and reflected in our publicly filed financial statements for the
quarter.

We are restricted in our ability to pay distributions
by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities. Our declaration of distributions is also subject to Cayman Islands law and the discretion of our board of
directors. Under the terms of the Seagate Technology shareholders agreement, at least seven members of our board of directors must approve the payment of distributions in excess of 15% of our net income in the prior fiscal year. In deciding whether
or not to declare quarterly distributions, our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry, our financial results, our capital requirements, contractual and legal restrictions on
the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.

On July 14, 2003, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of
$0.04 per share to be paid on or before August 22, 2003 to our shareholders of record as of August 8, 2003. Since the closing of our initial public offering, we have made distributions, pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy in effect at such
time, of $0.03 per share to our shareholders of record as of each of February 14, 2003 and May 9, 2003. These distributions have totaled approximately $26 million in the aggregate.

Since the closing of the November 2000 transactions, we have made additional distributions unrelated to our quarterly
dividend policy. These include:

•

distributions of approximately $33 million and $167 million to our shareholders of record as of March 19, 2002 and May 17, 2002, respectively;

•

an in-kind distribution of a $32 million promissory note to our shareholders of record immediately following our sale of our XIOtech subsidiary on November 4, 2002; and

•

a distribution of approximately $262 million to our shareholders of record immediately prior to our initial public offering.


To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and
profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, the distribution will be treated as a return of capital for U.S. tax purposes, causing a reduction in a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares. We did not have
current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended June 27, 2003 and, accordingly, distributions paid on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurances that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes in future years. To the extent that we do have current or accumulated earnings and profits
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a distribution on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital distribution and will be treated as dividend income.

Furthermore, we currently believe that we are a foreign personal holding company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under
recent U.S. federal income tax legislation, U.S. shareholders who are individuals will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income (currently a maximum rate of 15%) on distributions on our common shares if we
qualify as a foreign personal holding company in the year in which such distributions were made or in the preceding taxable year.

Use of Proceeds

The effective date of our first registration statement, filed on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 333-100513) and relating to the
initial public offering of our common shares, was December 10, 2002. A total of 72,500,000 of our common shares were sold. The managing underwriters for the offering were Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Goldman,
Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Thomas Weisel Partners LLC.

The offering commenced on December 10, 2002 and has been completed. Of the
72,500,000 common shares registered, 24,000,000 shares were offered and sold by us and 48,500,000 shares were offered and sold by New SAC, our parent company, as selling shareholder. The aggregate offering price was $870,000,000. The underwriting
discount was $36,975,000. We incurred approximately $5 million of other expenses in connection with the offerings. The net proceeds to us totaled approximately $275,760,000.

Approximately $147 million of the proceeds were used to make payments to participants in our deferred compensation plan. The
remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development programs, sales and marketing capabilities, general administrative functions and capital expenditures. In addition, immediately prior to
the closing of our initial public offering, we paid a return of capital distribution of approximately $262 million to our then-existing shareholders.

Equity Plan Compensation Information

Information regarding Equity Plan Compensation is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement to be filed with the Commission within 120 days of the
end of our fiscal year.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of
operations for the period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000, the period from November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001, the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002 and the fiscal year ended June 27, 2003 for us and our predecessor. Financial
information for the period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000 is the historical financial information of our predecessor, and when combined with the period from November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001 is considered herein to be pro forma
fiscal year 2001. Through November 22, 2000, the rigid disc drive business that we now operate and the storage area networks business that was operated through November 4, 2002 by XIOtech Corporation, our former wholly-owned subsidiary, were the
rigid disc drive and storage area networks divisions of Seagate Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which is referred to herein as “Seagate Delaware”. Those divisions are our predecessor, and our operations prior to the sale of
XIOtech were substantially identical to the operations of our predecessor before the November 2000 transactions. Although we were incorporated on August 10, 2000, prior to November 23, 2000, our operations were not material. Pro forma financial
information related to revenue and cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2001 is based on our historical consolidated financial statements for the period from November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001 and the historical combined financial
statements of our predecessor for the period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000, adjusted to give pro forma effect to the November 2000 transactions and to eliminate the related compensation charges, as if the November 2000 transactions had
occurred on July 1, 2000.

You should read this
discussion in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included elsewhere in this Report. Except as noted, references to any fiscal year mean the twelve-month period ending on the
Friday closest to June 30 of that year.

Our Company

We are a leader in the design, manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc
drives. Rigid disc drives are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop computers and consumer electronics to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the Internet. We
produce a broad range of rigid disc drive products that make us a leader in both the enterprise sector of our industry, where our products are primarily used in enterprise servers, mainframes and workstations, and the personal storage sector of our
industry, where our products are used in PCs and consumer electronics. We have also recently introduced new products for the mobile sector, where our rigid disc drives are used in notebook computers.

We sell our rigid disc drives primarily to major original equipment
manufacturers, or OEMs, and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand name. For pro forma fiscal year 2001 and fiscal years 2002 and 2003, approximately 70%, 66% and 61%, respectively, of our combined rigid disc drive revenue
was from sales to OEMs, including customers such as Hewlett-Packard, including Compaq, Dell, EMC, IBM and Sun Microsystems. We have longstanding relationships with many of these OEM customers. We also have key relationships with major distributors,
who sell our rigid disc drive products to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world. For pro forma fiscal year 2001 and fiscal years 2002 and 2003, approximately 40%, 39% and 34%, respectively, of our revenue
came from customers located in North America, approximately 34%, 31% and 31%, respectively, came from customers located in Europe and approximately 26%, 30% and 35%, respectively, came from customers located in the Far East. Substantially all of our
revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.

November 2000 Transactions

Overview

Prior to November 22, 2000, Suez Acquisition Company, the predecessor to New
SAC, entered into a stock purchase agreement with Seagate Delaware and Seagate Software Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Seagate Delaware. Concurrently, Seagate Delaware and VERITAS Software Corporation entered into an agreement and plan of merger
and reorganization. Suez Acquisition Company was an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and formed solely for the purpose of entering into the stock purchase agreement and undertaking the related
acquisitions. As discussed below, Suez Acquisition Company later assigned all of its rights and obligations under the stock purchase agreement to New SAC, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands
and formed for the same purpose.


In connection with the stock purchase agreement, Suez Acquisition Company agreed to purchase for $1.840
billion in cash substantially all of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Seagate Delaware’s disc drive, tape drive, storage area networks and software businesses and operations and selected cash
balances, but excluding the approximately 128 million shares of VERITAS common stock held by Seagate Software Holdings, Inc. and Seagate Delaware’s equity investments in Gadzoox Networks, Inc. and Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products N.V., or
LHSP. The $1.840 billion included transaction costs of $25 million. In addition, under the stock purchase agreement, Suez Acquisition Company agreed to assume substantially all of the operating liabilities of Seagate Delaware and its consolidated
subsidiaries. Suez Acquisition Company also agreed to acquire Seagate Technology Investments Holdings, Inc., or STIH, a former subsidiary of Seagate Delaware, which at the time of the November 2000 transactions held strategic investments in various
companies, such as e2open.com and Iolon, Inc. Prior to the closing of the November 2000 transactions, Suez Acquisition Company assigned all its rights and obligations under the stock purchase agreement to New SAC. After the closing of those
transactions, New SAC became our direct parent company and the indirect parent company of various other former subsidiaries of Seagate Delaware.

Immediately following the consummation of the November 2000 transactions, VERITAS acquired the remainder of Seagate Delaware by way of a merger of a
wholly-owned subsidiary of VERITAS with and into Seagate Delaware, with Seagate Delaware surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of VERITAS. We refer to this transaction as the VERITAS merger. VERITAS did not acquire Seagate Delaware’s
disc drive business or any other Seagate Delaware operating business, but it did acquire:

•

approximately 128 million shares of VERITAS common stock held by Seagate Software Holdings, Inc.;

•

capital stock of Seagate Software Holdings, Inc.;

•

cash on the balance sheet of Seagate Delaware in excess of the required cash balance of $765 million, as adjusted, that was purchased by Suez Acquisition Company; and

•

Seagate Delaware’s equity investments in Gadzoox Networks and LHSP.

In the VERITAS merger, Seagate Delaware’s stockholders received merger consideration consisting of VERITAS stock, cash and an interest in specified tax refunds that
are attributable to Seagate Delaware.

An indemnification
agreement provides that New SAC and its subsidiaries are required to indemnify VERITAS and its affiliates for specified liabilities of Seagate Delaware and Seagate Software Holdings, Inc., including selected taxes. In return, VERITAS, Seagate
Delaware and their affiliates agreed to indemnify New SAC and its subsidiaries for specified liabilities, including all taxes of Seagate Delaware for which New SAC was not obligated to indemnify VERITAS and its affiliates. VERITAS deposited $150
million in an escrow account, which may be applied by New SAC to satisfy certain tax liabilities, and which remains in the escrow account in full. To the extent that any part of the $150 million is not utilized to satisfy these tax liabilities, it
will be paid out to the former Seagate Delaware stockholders. In July 2002, we and those of our affiliates that are parties to the indemnification agreement entered into a reimbursement agreement which allocates the respective liabilities and
obligations under the indemnification agreement. Under the reimbursement agreement, if we and our affiliates become obligated to indemnify Seagate Delaware, VERITAS or any of their affiliates for tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement,
Seagate Technology HDD Holdings will be responsible for the first $125 million of the tax liabilities, and any amount exceeding $125 million will then be allocated among Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, Seagate Technology SAN Holdings, Certance
Holdings and Seagate Software (Cayman) Holdings Corporation on a pro rata basis in accordance with the portion of the purchase price allocated to each entity in connection with the November 2000 transactions. For indemnification obligations other
than tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement, the responsible entity will reimburse any entity that satisfies the obligation on its behalf.

Management Rollover

In connection with the November 2000 transactions, approximately 100 members of Seagate Delaware’s management group entered into rollover agreements
under which they agreed not to receive merger consideration consisting of VERITAS stock and cash in respect of a portion of their restricted shares of Seagate Delaware’s common stock and unvested options to purchase those shares. The aggregate
value of this foregone consideration was approximately $184 million. Instead of receiving this merger consideration, members of the management group received restricted ordinary and preferred shares of New SAC granted under the New SAC 2000
Restricted Share Plan and participation interests in our deferred compensation plan.


New SAC Restricted Shares.

At the closing of the November 2000 transactions, the board of
directors of New SAC adopted the New SAC 2000 Restricted Share Plan. The 2000 Restricted Share Plan allows for the awarding of grants of ordinary and preferred shares of New SAC to management, employees, directors and consultants of New SAC and its
affiliates. New SAC issued 1,843,000 restricted ordinary shares and 48,500 restricted preferred shares under this plan to those members of management participating in the rollover agreements described below. The restricted ordinary and preferred
shares granted under the 2000 Restricted Share Plan vested as follows:

•

one-third of the shares vested on November 22, 2001;

•

one-third vested proportionately each month over the 18 months following November 22, 2001; and

•

the final one-third vested on May 22, 2003.

In addition, at the closing of the November 2000 transactions certain individuals purchased additional ordinary and preferred shares of New SAC for
approximately $41 million in cash. Of this $41 million, approximately $21 million was purchased by members of the management group.

Following the closing of the November 2000 transactions, the board of directors of New SAC approved the 2001 Restricted Share Plan. Unlike the 2000
Restricted Share Plan, the 2001 Restricted Share Plan only provides for the grant of restricted ordinary shares of New SAC and does not provide for the grant of restricted preferred shares of New SAC. Like the 2000 Restricted Share Plan, the 2001
Restricted Share Plan allows for the award of grants to management, employees, directors and consultants of New SAC and its affiliates. New SAC has issued 483,523 restricted ordinary shares under this plan. Restricted shares granted under the 2001
Restricted Share Plan will vest as follows:

•

25% of the shares will vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date; and

•

75% of the shares will vest proportionately each month over the 36 months following the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date.

New SAC redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares as of March 14,
2003. As of June 27, 2003 there were 2,255,920 restricted ordinary shares outstanding under both the 2000 and 2001 Restricted Share Plans. Accordingly, we have been recognizing, and will continue to recognize, compensation expense of approximately
$28 million proportionately over the respective vesting periods based on the estimated fair value of these shares on the date of issuance. Through June 27, 2003, we had recognized $26 million of this compensation expense.

Deferred Compensation Plan

. In connection with the management
rollover, and in addition to the grant of restricted ordinary and preferred shares of New SAC, members of the management group received approximately $179 million of interests in deferred compensation plans adopted by our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Each member of the management group received an interest in one of the plans, with the substantial majority of the members receiving interests in the Seagate Technology HDD Holdings plan. At inception, the interests in the deferred compensation plan
were subject to multi-year vesting.

In May 2002, we made $32
million in payments to participants in the deferred compensation plan. On June 19, 2002, the board of directors accelerated vesting of all deferred compensation interests under the terms of the plan. As a result of certain distributions by New SAC
to holders of its preferred shares in connection with our initial public offering, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings became obligated to make payments of approximately $147 million to participants of its deferred compensation plan, including named
executive officers. Those payments were made following the closing of our initial public offering, thereby satisfying all remaining obligations under the deferred compensation plan.

Seagate Technology Share Option Plan

In December 2000, our board of directors adopted our share option plan. Under the terms of this share option plan, eligible
employees, directors and consultants can be awarded options to purchase our common shares under vesting terms to be determined at the date of grant. In January 2002, this share option plan was amended to increase the maximum number of common shares
issuable under the share option plan from 72 million to 100 million shares. No options to purchase our common shares had been issued through June 29, 2001. From July 1, 2001 through June 27, 2003, options to purchase 87,954,753 common shares were
granted to employees under this share option plan, net of cancellations. This represents approximately 17% of our total voting power, assuming the exercise of all options. As of June 27, 2003, options to purchase 14,870,267 common shares had been
exercised.


Allocation of Net Purchase Price

New SAC accounted for the November 2000 transactions as a purchase in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 16, “Business Combinations.” All acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities were valued based on their relative fair values and
reorganized into the following businesses:

•

the rigid disc drive and storage area networks business, which is now Seagate Technology;

•

the tape drive business, which is now known as Certance Holdings;

•

the software business, or Crystal Decisions; and

•

an investment holding company, Seagate Technology Investments Holdings, or STIH.

Certance Holdings, Crystal Decisions and STIH are direct or indirect subsidiaries of New SAC and are not owned by us. The
fair value of the net assets acquired by New SAC exceeded the net purchase price of $1.840 billion by approximately $909 million. Accordingly, the resultant negative goodwill was allocated on a pro rata basis to the acquired long-lived assets and
reduced the recorded amounts by approximately 46%.

The table
below summarizes the allocation of net purchase price by New SAC (dollars in millions).

(1)

Acquired current assets included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets. The fair values of current assets generally approximated the
recorded historic book values. Short-term investments were valued based on quoted market prices. Inventory values were estimated based on the current market value of the inventories less completion costs and less a profit margin for activities
remaining to be completed until the inventory is sold. Valuation allowances were established for current deferred tax assets in excess of long-term deferred tax liabilities. Assumed current liabilities included accounts payable, accrued compensation
and expenses and accrued income taxes. The fair values of current liabilities generally approximated the historic recorded book values because of the monetary nature of most of the liabilities.

(2)

The value of individual long-term equity investments was based upon quoted market prices, where available, and where market prices were not available, was based on New SAC’s
estimates of the fair values of the individual investments.

(3)

New SAC estimated the fair value of the acquired property, plant and equipment. In arriving at the determination of market value for these assets, New SAC considered the estimated
cost to construct or acquire comparable property. Machinery and equipment were assessed using replacement cost estimates reduced by depreciation factors representing the condition, functionality and operability of the assets. The sales comparison
approach was used for office and data communication equipment. Land, land improvements, buildings and building and leasehold improvements were valued based upon discussions with knowledgeable independent personnel.

(4)

New SAC estimated the value of acquired identified intangibles. The significant assumptions relating to each category are discussed in the following paragraphs. Also, these assets
are being amortized on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful life and resultant amortization is included in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles.

Trade names

—The value of the trade names was based upon discounting to their net present value the licensing income that would arise by
charging the operating businesses that use the trade names.

Developed

technologies—The value of this asset for each operating
business was determined by discounting to their net present value the expected future cash flows attributable to all existing technologies that had reached technological feasibility, after considering risks relating to: (a) the characteristics and
applications of the technology, (b) existing and future markets and (c) life cycles of the technologies. Estimates of future revenues and expenses used to determine the value of developed technology were consistent with the historical trends in the
industry and expected performance.


Assembled workforces

—The value of the assembled workforce was determined by estimating the
recruiting, hiring and training costs to replace each group of existing employees.

In-process research and development

—The
value of in-process research and development was based on an evaluation of all developmental projects using the guidance set forth in Interpretation No. 4 of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Statement No. 2, “Accounting for
Research and Development Costs” and FASB Statement No. 86, “Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.”

The amount was determined by: (a) obtaining management estimates of future revenues and operating profits associated with existing developmental projects, (b) projecting the cash flows and costs to completion of the
underlying technologies and resultant products and (c) discounting these cash flows to their net present value.

Estimates of future
revenues and expenses used to determine the value of in-process research and development were consistent with the historical trends in the industry and expected performance. The entire amount was charged to operations because related technologies
had not reached technological feasibility and they had no alternative future use.

(5)

Long-term deferred tax liabilities arose as a result of the excess of the fair values of inventory and acquired intangible assets over their related tax basis. We had $434 million
of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance was established.

Allocation of Purchase Price to Us Pursuant to the Application of Push Down Accounting

The November 2000 transactions constituted a purchase transaction by New SAC
of substantially all the operating assets and liabilities of Seagate Delaware. Under purchase accounting rules, the net purchase price has been allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities of Seagate Delaware and its subsidiaries based on their
estimated fair values at the date of the November 2000 transactions. New SAC estimated the fair values, including in-process research and development. However, the estimated fair values of identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities
acquired from Seagate Delaware and its subsidiaries were greater than the amount paid, resulting in negative goodwill. The negative goodwill was allocated to the long-lived tangible and intangible assets, as well as in-process research and
development. This includes amounts relating to Seagate Technology, on the basis of relative fair values. Subsequently, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002, in accordance with SFAS 109 we reduced the net carrying value of the long-lived
intangibles from $104 million to zero to reflect the recognition of tax benefits. See Note 5 of the audited consolidated and combined financial statements of Seagate Technology and its Predecessor.

In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 54, “Push Down
Basis of Accounting Required in Certain Limited Circumstances,” the accounting for the purchase transaction has been “pushed down” from New SAC to our financial statements. Our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for
all periods subsequent to November 23, 2000 reflect the new basis in our assets and liabilities at that date, including the pushed down purchase accounting adjustments.

As a result of the November 2000 transactions and the push down accounting, our results of operations following the November
2000 transactions, particularly the depreciation and amortization charges, are not necessarily comparable to our predecessor’s results of operations prior to the November 2000 transactions. Depreciation charges following the November 2000
transactions are lower as a result of write-downs of our depreciable assets pursuant to purchase accounting rules. The favorable effect on results of operations from these lower charges will gradually decrease in future periods as our older assets
become fully depreciated and new, higher-priced assets are acquired.

Current Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations

Industry Dynamics.

Our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning, financial condition and results of operations. One key trend has been the decline in spending on information
technology by enterprises and consumers as a result of the weakened global economy. The slowdown in enterprise expenditures is also a result of the extensive investments that many enterprises had already made in recent years before the global
economic slowdown. Currently, demand for rigid disc drives in the enterprise sector is being adversely impacted as a result of the weakened economy and because enterprises have shifted their focus from making new equipment purchases to more
efficiently using their existing information technology infrastructure through, among other things, adopting new storage architectures.

Simultaneously with this economic weakness, there has been continued consolidation and attrition among our competitors. For instance, in 2001 Maxtor
merged with Quantum’s rigid disc drive operations and IBM recently merged its rigid disc drive business with that of Hitachi. Also in 2001, Fujitsu ceased manufacturing rigid disc drives for the personal storage market. This consolidation among
our competitors has contributed to shifts in market share as newly combined companies focus on integrating their operations and OEMs maintain diversity by shifting their purchasing allocations to new suppliers. Also, as manufacturers merge or exit
the rigid disc drive industry, they frequently liquidate their excess inventory leading to competitive pressure which has resulted in even lower selling prices.


Consolidation is also occurring among our customers. For example, Compaq, our largest customer in fiscal
2001, merged with Hewlett-Packard in our fiscal year 2002. As a result of this trend, our customer base is increasingly concentrated among fewer OEMs, potentially providing them with increased pricing leverage. In the event that our sales to a
combined entity are less than, or are on terms that are less favorable than, our sales to these customers when they were separate entities, our results of operations would suffer.

Historically, our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in technology, which contributed to
rapid product life cycles, the importance of being first to market with new products and the difficulty in recovering research and development expenses. However, based upon the recent pace of new product introductions, we believe that our industry
is entering a period in which the rate of increases in areal density will be lower than the rate of the last several years. The slowing change in areal density contributes to:

•

the increased importance of successfully executing product transitions, as factors such as quality, reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance;
and

•

increasing average price erosion, as product life cycles are lengthened and the ability of rigid disc drive producers to introduce new products at higher prices is limited.

Seagate Dynamics.

During the past several
years we have restructured our operations to reduce our costs and improve our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility. Since 1998, we and our predecessor have implemented restructuring plans that have resulted in total net charges of approximately
$361 million, the closing of 14 facilities and a reduction in headcount of approximately 40,000 employees. Through our Factory of the Future initiative, we have increased the use of automation in our manufacturing operations. We believe that these
changes in our operations have added to our manufacturing flexibility allowing us to improve our responsiveness to customers and take advantage of unforecasted sales opportunities to deliver products on short notice. Additionally, we have
substantially improved our gross margin due to these ongoing cost savings from our restructuring activities and our programs to implement operating efficiencies. We have further benefited from reductions in depreciation expense resulting from
write-downs to the fair market value of our depreciable assets in connection with the November 2000 transactions. The favorable effects on results of operations from these lower depreciation charges in connection with the write-down will gradually
decrease in future periods as our older assets become fully depreciated and new, higher-priced assets are acquired and recorded at cost. We believe our reduced cost structure and improved manufacturing efficiency provides us with greater flexibility
to address changing market conditions.

We maintain a highly
integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing components we view as critical to our products, such as read/write heads and recording media. We believe that our control of these key technologies, combined with our innovations in
manufacturing, enable us to achieve product performance and time-to-market leadership. This leadership position has enabled us to leverage our investments in research and development. Although we believe that we derive an important competitive
advantage as a result of this strategy, it results in higher fixed costs, which may adversely affect our financial performance in periods of declining demand. This approach also increases the importance of realizing and maintaining substantial
market share in the markets in which we compete, allowing us to spread our technology investments across a high unit volume of products.

The slowing rate of increase of areal density has increased the importance of our successful execution of new product transitions and of competitive
factors such as quality, reliability and our manufacturing yield. We recently completed our transition to the 80 gigabyte per disc platform for our desktop products and our improved manufacturing yields from these products have contributed to our
recent financial performance. We also have begun limited revenue shipments of our first notebook products, the Momentus disc drives, which address a segment of the notebook computer market. Although we are shipping notebook drives to OEMs, we
currently have not completed qualification programs with a number of OEMs, which are material to the success of these products.

Because we use a fiscal year instead of a calendar year, it is necessary every four to five years to realign our fiscal quarter-ends with calendar
quarter-ends. As a result, fiscal year 2004 will have 53 weeks and our first quarter of the year will have 14 weeks, ended on October 3, 2003. We do not expect the additional week in the first quarter to have a material impact on our operating
results, as compared to what we would have expected during a 13-week quarter.


Disposition of Assets

Sale of XIOtech Corporation.

On November 4, 2002, we sold XIOtech to New SAC. New SAC in turn sold 51% of XIOtech to a third party in a transaction
in which XIOtech also sold newly issued shares to this third party. As a result, New SAC has retained an interest of less than 20% of XIOtech.

In consideration of our sale of XIOtech to New SAC, we received a $32 million promissory note from New SAC. The amount of this promissory note was equal
to the estimated fair value of XIOtech as of the date of the sale, net of intercompany indebtedness. Immediately after the sale of XIOtech to New SAC, we made an in-kind pro rata distribution of the entire promissory note to our existing
shareholders, including New SAC, which at the time owned approximately 99.4% of our outstanding shares. That portion of the promissory note distributed back to New SAC was cancelled, and New SAC immediately paid off the remaining 0.6% of the
promissory note held by our minority shareholders. As a result of our sale of XIOtech we no longer consolidated XIOtech’s operations with our operations subsequent to November 4, 2002.

Because New SAC at the time owned approximately 99.4% of our outstanding
shares, our sale of XIOtech to New SAC was recorded as a distribution of an amount equal to the net book value of XIOtech rather than as a sale for the fair value of the promissory note. As of November 4, 2002, the net book value of XIOtech was
approximately $1 million.

Repair and Warranty Services
Agreement.

On October 28, 2002, we closed the sale of our product repair and servicing facility in Reynosa, Mexico and certain related equipment and inventory to a wholly owned subsidiary of Jabil Circuit, Inc. After the sale, Jabil became our
primary source provider of warranty repair services for a multi-year period at costs defined in a long-term services agreement. During the term of this services agreement, we will be dependent upon Jabil to effectively manage warranty repair related
costs and activities.

The arrangement with Jabil is comprised
of various elements, including the sale of the facility, equipment and inventory, our obligations under the services agreement and potential reimbursements by us to Jabil. Because the fair values of each of these elements have not been separately
established, and because we will repurchase the inventory sold to Jabil, the $10 million excess of the sale prices assigned to the various elements of the arrangements with Jabil over their respective carrying values will be offset against cost of
revenue as a reduction to warranty expense over the period of the long-term services agreement. Of the $10 million excess, $5 million was utilized in the quarter ended December 27, 2002 to offset an immediate repair cost increase, and the remaining
$5 million is being utilized over the remaining period of the long-term services agreement.

Stock Compensation Expense

In connection with certain options granted during the six months ended December 27, 2002, we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling $10.7 million, representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of
our common shares on the dates such options were granted. This deferred stock compensation is being amortized over the vesting periods of the underlying stock options of 48 months. Through June 27, 2003, we have amortized approximately $2 million of
such compensation expense.

Consummation of Initial Public Offering

On December 13, 2002, we completed the initial public
offering of 72,500,000 of our common shares, 24,000,000 of which were sold by us and 48,500,000 of which were sold by New SAC, our parent company, as selling shareholder, at a price of $12 per share. We received proceeds from our sale of the
24,000,000 newly issued common shares of approximately $270 million after deducting underwriting fees, discounts and commissions. In connection with our initial public offering, all previously outstanding shares of preferred stock aggregating 400
million shares were converted by New SAC into our common stock. Immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, we paid a return of capital distribution of $262 million, or $0.65 per share, to the holders of our then-outstanding
shares, including New SAC. We also paid a lump sum of approximately $12 million to members of our sponsor group in exchange for the discontinuation of an annual monitoring fee of $2 million. This payment was charged to marketing and administrative
expense during the quarter ended December 27, 2002.

New SAC
received proceeds of approximately $557 million from the sale of 48,500,000 common shares in our initial public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. New SAC distributed these net proceeds, together with the proceeds from
the distribution described above, to holders of its preferred and ordinary shares. As a result of the distribution to New SAC’s preferred shareholders, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, became obligated to make
payments of approximately $147 million to the participants in its deferred compensation plan. These payments were made following the closing of our initial public offering, and as a consequence there are no longer any outstanding obligations under
that deferred compensation plan.


Consummation of Secondary Public Offering

Under the Seagate Technology shareholders agreement among New SAC, our financial sponsors and us, New SAC has demand
registration rights to request from time to time that we register and sell shares of our common stock held by New SAC. New SAC exercised this right and on July 30, 2003, we completed the secondary public offering of 69,000,000 of our common shares,
including 9,000,000 shares subject to the over-allotment option, all of which were sold by New SAC, as selling shareholder, at a price of $18.75 per share. New SAC received proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions of approximately $39 million. We incurred direct expenses aggregating approximately $1 million related to the offering. New SAC distributed its net proceeds to holders of its ordinary shares including approximately $245
million distributed to our officers and employees who hold ordinary shares of New SAC.


Results of Operations

We list in the tables below the historical consolidated and combined statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods
indicated.

Charges recorded in
the historical financial statements of us and our predecessor, including charges related to the November 2000 transactions, have been significant and impact the comparability of the results of operations of us and our predecessor for the periods
presented and will impact the comparability of results for future periods. For a description of these charges, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the notes thereto.

In the discussions of “Fiscal Year 2002 Results of Operations” and “Fiscal Year 2001 Results of
Operations” set forth below, we refer to the revenue and cost of revenue data for fiscal year 2001 as “pro forma” for comparative purposes. The pro forma revenue and cost of revenue data give effect to the November 2000 transactions
as if they had occurred on July 1, 2000. Pro forma revenue for fiscal year 2001 is the sum of the historical revenue of our predecessor for the period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000 and our historical revenue for the period from
November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001. Pro forma cost of revenue for fiscal year 2001 is the sum of the historical cost of revenue of our predecessor for the period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000 and our historical cost of revenue for
the period from November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001, as adjusted for:

•

the elimination of the $265 million compensation charge recorded as a result of the acceleration and net exercise of Seagate Delaware stock options held by employees of Seagate
Technology at November 22, 2000;

•

the reduction of depreciation expense by $107 million due to new, lower accounting basis in property, equipment and leasehold improvements; and

•

the elimination of the adverse impact of $131 million related to the sale of higher cost inventories that were written up to fair value at the close of the November 2000
transactions.


Fiscal Year 2003 Compared to Fiscal Year 2002

Revenue.

Revenue for fiscal year 2003 was $6.486 billion, up 7% from
$6.087 billion in fiscal year 2002. The increase in revenue was primarily due to improved unit sales volume that was substantially offset by price erosion and a shift in mix to our personal storage products as compared to our enterprise storage
products. Our unit shipments increased from 55 million units in fiscal year 2002 to 68 million units in fiscal year 2003. This increase in unit shipments was in both our personal storage products and our enterprise storage products and was due to an
increase in the total available market, especially for personal storage products, as well as our share of the total available market. We experienced strong growth in shipments to non-gaming applications, and we expect this trend will continue.

Our overall average unit sales price for our rigid disc drive
products was $93, $94, $97 and $97 for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2003, respectively. Average price erosion from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 was approximately 14%. Price erosion in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2003 was the lowest we have experienced in eight years. Over the past few quarters, including seasonally weak periods, our industry has demonstrated operational discipline in managing production and inventory levels. As a result, it is
our expectation that for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, price erosion will be at the low end of the industry’s historical range.

During fiscal year 2003, we continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. We exercise a considerable degree of
judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels, sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs. During fiscal year 2003, the total provision for
sales programs, recorded as contra-revenue, was approximately 5% of gross revenue, compared to 4% of gross revenue for fiscal year 2002. The increase in the provision for sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue in fiscal year 2003 as
compared to fiscal year 2002 was a result of the increase in the portion of our revenue derived from sales to distributors.

Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue for fiscal year 2003 was $4.759 billion, up 6% from $4.494 billion in fiscal year 2002. Gross margin as a
percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2003 was 27% as compared with 26% for fiscal year 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue resulted from overall costs decreasing at a higher rate than price erosion and was primarily due to
improved absorption of fixed costs from increased unit sales volume. Ongoing cost savings as a result of our restructuring activities and our continued implementation of operational efficiencies also benefited our gross margins. In addition, gross
margins were enhanced by improved yields for products introduced during the last half of fiscal year 2003 as well as a trend toward increased price stability.

Product Development Expenses.

Product development expenses decreased by $28 million, or 4%, for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year
2002. The decrease in product development expenses from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the non-recurrence of deferred compensation charges incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and our sale of XIOtech in November 2002. These
decreases were partially offset by increased expenses related to the opening of our new research facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which included employee, equipment and occupancy costs as well as several new product introductions and our
development efforts in smaller than 3.5-inch form factor rigid disc drives.

Marketing and Administrative Expenses.

Marketing and administrative expenses decreased by $141 million, or 28%, for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002. The decrease in marketing and
administrative expenses from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the non-recurrence of deferred compensation charges of $112 million incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002, and decreases of $48 million as a result of our sale of
XIOtech in November 2002 and $21 million in the provision for bad debts. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $20 million in salaries and related costs, $14 million in information technology expense and $7 million in depreciation
expense.

Restructuring.

During fiscal year 2003, we
recorded $19 million in restructuring charges. We also reduced a restructuring accrual previously recorded by our predecessor in fiscal year 1998 by $10 million due to a change in estimated lease obligations. These combined actions resulted in a net
restructuring charge of $9 million in fiscal year 2003. Of the $19 million, $17 million was incurred in the quarter ended September 27, 2002 as a result of a restructuring plan, which we refer to as the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan,
established to continue the alignment of our global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements, primarily in our Far East operations. The restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination
costs relating to a reduction in our workforce of approximately 3,750 employees, 3,410 of whom had been terminated as of June 27, 2003. We estimate that after completion of the restructuring activities contemplated by the fiscal year 2003
restructuring plan, annual salary expense will be reduced by approximately $12 million, excluding any savings in salary expense related to XIOtech which was sold in November 2002. The fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan was substantially complete at
June 27, 2003. The remaining $2 million restructuring charge was incurred in the quarter ended June 27, 2003 and was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a workforce reduction of approximately 686 employees in our Thailand operations.
We estimate that after completion of these restructuring activities, annual salary expense will be reduced by approximately $0.3 million. These restructuring activities were completed in July 2003.


Net Other Income (Expense).

Net other expense decreased $104 million, or 77%, for fiscal year 2003
when compared with fiscal year 2002. The decrease in net other expense from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to decreases of $93 million related to the debt refinancing charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and a $30 million reduction
in interest expense in fiscal year 2003 as a result of lower average outstanding debt and lower average interest rates paid because of our debt refinancing in May 2002. These decreases were partially offset by $10 million in write-downs of our
investment in a private company in fiscal year 2003 and a decrease in interest income of $9 million resulting from lower average interest rates and a lower average balance in our interest bearing accounts.

Income Taxes.

We recorded a provision for income taxes of $19 million
for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2003 compared to a provision for income taxes of $86 million for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002. We are a foreign holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with foreign and U.S. subsidiaries that
operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or exempt from tax due to tax holidays that we operate under in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand which are scheduled to
expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2010. As of June 30, 2003, our manufacturing operations in China no longer operate under a tax holiday. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2003 differs from the
provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to income before income taxes primarily due to (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and (ii) the realization of various deferred tax
assets that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to income
before taxes primarily due to the net effect of (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and (ii) an increase in our valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax assets. Based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to
potential future increases in our valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets, we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Dividend distributions received from our
U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes when, and if, distributed. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the Cayman
Islands or U.S. federal income tax if remitted to the foreign parent holding company.

As of June 27, 2003, we have recorded net deferred tax assets of $74 million, the realization of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient U.S. taxable income in fiscal years 2004 and 2005.
Although realization is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease in subsequent
quarters, when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. taxable income.

On July 31, 2001, Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service filed a settlement stipulation with the United States Tax Court in complete settlement
of the remaining disputed tax matter reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated June 12, 1998. The settlement stipulation is expressly contingent upon Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service entering into a closing agreement in
connection with certain tax matters arising in all or some part of the open tax years of Seagate Delaware and New SAC. The settlement remains before the Joint Committee on Taxation for review. The parties are in the process of incorporating comments
from the Joint Committee on Taxation into the parties’ settlement agreements. The settlement and the anticipated execution of the closing agreement(s) will not result in an additional provision for income taxes.

As of June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, accrued income taxes include $125
million for tax indemnification amounts due to VERITAS Software Corporation pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement between Seagate Delaware, Suez Acquisition Company and VERITAS Software Corporation. The tax indemnification amount was recorded by
us in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware by New SAC and represents U.S. tax liabilities previously accrued by Seagate Delaware for periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets. Certain of
Seagate Delaware’s federal and state tax returns are under examination by tax authorities. We believe that the $125 million tax indemnification amount is adequate to cover any final assessments that may result from these examinations. The
timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain. To the extent the settlement of these examinations results in tax liabilities that are less than the $125 million indemnification amount, the difference will be recorded as an income tax
benefit and may significantly affect our effective tax rate for the period in which the settlement occurs.

Certain of our foreign tax returns for various fiscal years are under examination by taxing authorities. We believe that adequate amounts of tax have been
provided for any final assessment that may result from these examinations.


Fiscal Year 2002 Results of Operations

Revenue.

Revenue in fiscal year 2002 was $6.087 billion, up 2% from
$5.966 billion in pro forma fiscal year 2001. The increase in revenue was primarily due to improved unit sales volume and product mix that was substantially offset by price erosion. Our unit shipments increased from 43 million units in pro forma
fiscal year 2001 to 55 million units in fiscal year 2002. This increase was primarily caused by market share gains driven by increased unit shipments of personal storage and enterprise storage rigid disc drive products to OEMs and continued growth
in the rigid disc drive market for consumer electronics such as Microsoft’s Xbox. We attribute these gains in market share primarily to the market acceptance of our 40 gigabyte personal storage disc drives and our 73 gigabyte enterprise storage
disc drive, each of which achieved volume production in the beginning of fiscal year 2002. In addition, we gained a higher share of some of our OEM customers’ rigid disc drive purchases due to favorable execution versus our competitors and due
to industry consolidation. Our strategy to implement operational efficiencies has increased our manufacturing flexibility and in fiscal year 2002 this enabled us to take advantage of unforecasted customer demand and deliver products on short notice.

Our overall average unit sales price for our rigid disc drive
products was $118, $109, $111 and $100 for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2002, respectively. Average price erosion from pro forma fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2002 was approximately 20%. Price erosion during the
period was driven primarily by the introduction of new, higher storage capacity products. Due to the achievement of higher areal densities, these new products require fewer discs and read/write heads and therefore cost less to produce. Since they
cost less to produce, these products can be priced lower than would otherwise be possible and, as a result, drive down prices of older generation products. Competition also contributed to price erosion during this period. The pricing environment
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 was extremely aggressive; a condition that was exacerbated by competitors exiting the industry and liquidating their excess inventory.

During fiscal year 2002, we continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. We exercise a
considerable degree of judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels, sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs. During fiscal year 2002, the
total provision for sales programs recorded as contra-revenue was approximately 4% of total revenue, compared to 3% of total revenue over each of the two previous fiscal years. The increase in sales program expenses during fiscal year 2002 was due
primarily to the higher cost of price protection programs, which are based on estimates of distributor inventory levels and current and future price erosion rates. As price erosion rates in the rigid disc drive industry escalated during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2002, the cost of price protection programs increased accordingly. Furthermore, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2002, our North American distribution customers transitioned from a consignment model, where the inventory is
owned by us until it is sold by the distributor, to a sell-in model, where the inventory is owned by the distributor. During fiscal year 2002, this transition resulted in a one-time increase in total revenue, operating income and net income of
approximately 1%, 3% and 7%, respectively. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2002, this transition resulted in a one-time increase in total revenue, operating income and net income of approximately 4%, 9% and 9%, respectively. Because our North
American distributors have transitioned to the sell-in model, the cost of our price protection programs may trend higher in future periods. Historically, actual sales program costs have approximated the estimated cost of such programs recognized in
our financial statements. Variances between actual and estimated costs of sales programs during each of the last three fiscal years have not been material due to our ongoing reviews of actual program expenses to ensure that accruals are continuously
adjusted to approximate the actual costs of sales programs. Should actual sales program costs in any period differ significantly from estimated sales program costs either as a result of higher than expected rates of price erosion or otherwise, our
future results of operations could be materially affected.

Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue for fiscal year 2002 was $4.494 billion, up 1% from $4.457 billion for pro forma fiscal year 2001. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2002 was 26% as compared with 25% for pro
forma fiscal year 2001. As discussed in the paragraph above, we experienced significant price erosion during the period. This price erosion exerted substantial downward pressure on our gross margins. However, this downward pressure was more than
offset by improved absorption of fixed costs from increased unit sales volume and a shift in mix to higher storage capacity products. It was also offset by ongoing cost savings as a result of our restructuring activities and our program to implement
operational efficiencies. Our restructuring activities during these periods were comprised of workforce reductions, capacity reductions, including closure of facilities or portions of facilities, and the write-off of excess equipment, primarily in
our Far East operations in Malaysia and Thailand. Our cost structure decreased as a result of reductions in our total number of manufacturing facilities and headcount. Pursuant to our strategy to implement operational efficiencies, we have increased
the degree of automation in our manufacturing operations, closed facilities, reduced headcount and reconfigured our production lines to handle multiple products.


We exercise a considerable degree of judgment in formulating the underlying estimates used for product
failure rates and trends, estimated repair costs and return rates. Actual warranty costs during fiscal year 2002 represented approximately 1% of total revenue. Warranty costs have trended down over the last few years even though shipment volumes
have increased. These reductions are due to reduced warranty periods, better product quality and more efficient repair operations. Historically, actual warranty costs have approximated the estimated warranty costs recognized in our financial
statements. Variances between actual and estimated warranty costs have not been material due to our ongoing reviews of return rates and repair costs to ensure that accruals are continuously adjusted to approximate actual warranty costs. Should
actual warranty costs in any period differ significantly from estimated warranty costs, our future results of operations could be materially affected.

Operating Expenses.

Under the credit agreement governing our new senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our 8% senior notes,
the restrictions on our ability to make payments under our deferred compensation plan were substantially reduced. In addition, on June 19, 2002, our board of directors accelerated vesting of all deferred compensation plan interests under the terms
of the plan. As a result, it became probable that all of our obligations under the deferred compensation plan would be paid. Accordingly, all of the remaining obligations under the deferred compensation plan, totaling $147 million, were accrued
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. Together with the $32 million payment we made to participants in the deferred compensation plan in May 2002, our total deferred compensation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002
was $179 million before related tax benefits. The income statement classification of the $179 million charge was as follows: Cost of revenue—$38 million; Product development expenses—$29 million; Marketing and administrative
expenses—$112 million.

In fiscal year 2002, product
development expenses were reduced by our restructuring activities, which resulted in a savings of $24 million in pre-production expenses, and by the consolidation of our rigid disc drive design centers, which resulted in a savings of $17 million. As
discussed above, product development expenses and marketing and administrative expenses included deferred compensation expenses of $29 million and $112 million, respectively.

Non-Operating Expenses.

Net other expense includes $93 million of charges incurred as a result of our debt
refinancing in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—The 2002 Refinancing.” Interest income was lower in fiscal year 2002 as a result of lower average invested cash following the November 2000
transactions.

Income Taxes.

We recorded a provision for
income taxes of $86 million for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002. Our provision for income taxes differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% tax rate to income before income taxes primarily
due to (i) the net effect of the tax benefit related to income generated from our manufacturing plants located in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand that operate under tax holidays (scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates
through 2010) and (ii) an increase in our valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax assets.

As of June 28, 2002, we have recorded net deferred tax assets of $58 million, the realization of which is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient U.S. taxable income in fiscal year 2003. Although realization
is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future U.S.
domestic taxable income are reduced. We will review our forecasts of U.S. taxable income in each quarter of fiscal year 2003 to evaluate and record adjustments to our valuation allowance if required.

During the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002, we reduced our valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets arising as a result of the November 2000 transactions to reflect the realization of acquired tax benefits in our U.S. income tax returns. The acquired tax benefits realized in our U.S. income tax returns exceeded
the $104 million net carrying value of our long-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware. In accordance with SFAS 109, we reduced our long-lived intangible assets acquired in the
November 2000 transactions to zero. As a result of the adjustment to the long-lived intangible assets, we will have no future depreciation and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the November 2000 transactions.

On July 31, 2001, Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service filed
a settlement stipulation with the United States Tax Court in complete settlement of the remaining disputed tax matters reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated June 12, 1998. The settlement stipulation is expressly contingent upon
Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service entering into a closing agreement in connection with certain tax matters arising in all or some part of the open tax years of Seagate Delaware and New SAC. The settlement remains before the Joint
Committee on Taxation for review. The parties are in the process of incorporating comments from the Joint Committee on Taxation into the parties’ settlement agreements. The settlement and the anticipated execution of the closing agreements will
not result in an additional provision for income taxes.

Certain of our U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns for various fiscal years are under examination by taxing authorities. We believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessments that may
result from these examinations.


As a result of the November 2000 transactions and the ensuing corporate structure, we now consist of a
foreign parent holding company with various U.S. domestic and foreign affiliates. We do not expect to be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on dividends or other earnings distributions that we may receive from foreign subsidiaries. Dividend
distributions by U.S. subsidiaries to Seagate Technology HDD Holdings may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes, if and when distributed. A substantial portion of our manufacturing operations located in the Far East currently operate free from tax
under various tax holidays, which are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2010. Because of our foreign ownership structure and subject to potential future increases in our valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax
assets, we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the U.S. federal statutory rate.

Fiscal Year 2001 Results of Operations

As a result of the closing of the November 2000 transactions, we initiated our operations on November 23, 2000. All results of operations prior to this
date included in this prospectus are the results of operations of our predecessor, the rigid disc drive and storage area networks business of Seagate Delaware. The following discussion describes the results of operations of our predecessor for the
period from July 1, 2000 through November 22, 2000 and our results of operations for the period from November 23, 2000 through June 29, 2001.

Period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000

. During this period our predecessor’s ability to satisfy customer demand was constrained by a
limited supply of certain electrical components from some of its external suppliers. This resulted in lower than expected revenues during this period and the shifting of unit shipments that were expected during this period into the subsequent
period. As a result of the acceleration of stock options in connection with the November 2000 transactions, compensation charges were allocated to cost of revenue, product development expenses, and marketing and administrative expenses in the
amounts of $265 million, $116 million and $185 million, respectively. Additionally, our predecessor incurred $77 million of marketing and administrative expenses related to administrative costs in connection with the November 2000 transactions.
During this period, our predecessor recorded restructuring charges of $19 million to continue the alignment of its global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements and net losses of $32 million
relative to certain of its investments in equity securities.

Seagate Delaware recorded a benefit from income taxes of $206 million in this period. The recorded benefit from income taxes differs from the benefit from income taxes that would be derived by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate to the
loss before income taxes primarily due to losses recorded in connection with the sale by Seagate Delaware of its operating assets located in the Far East that were not deductible for U.S. tax purposes and the write-off of deferred tax assets that
could not be recognized in the U.S. federal and state tax returns of our predecessor for the taxable period ended November 22, 2000.

As of November 22, 2000, our predecessor’s foreign manufacturing subsidiaries had approximately $3.050 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of
which approximately $1.722 billion were considered permanently reinvested offshore. In connection with the sale of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware, approximately $1.650 billion of the unremitted foreign earnings were deemed to be
distributed for U.S. tax purposes to the U.S. parent. Seagate Delaware had previously recorded deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $542 million for its foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested offshore. The deferred tax
liabilities were eliminated because the remaining unremitted earnings of our predecessor’s foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to U.S. corporate level tax if remitted to us.

Period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001

. During this period, and particularly in the quarter ended June 29,
2001, our revenue was negatively affected by an overall decline in demand for storage products due to reductions in global information technology spending partially offset by the abatement of supply constraints with respect to certain electrical
components. Our gross margins were positively impacted by lower charges to cost of revenue for depreciation of approximately $140 million resulting from write-downs to fair value of our depreciable assets in connection with the November 2000
transactions. Our gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of a $131 million write-up of inventories to fair value pursuant to purchase accounting rules and the subsequent sale of that inventory during the period. At the time of the
closing of the November 2000 transactions, we incurred marketing and administrative expenses of $40 million as a result of management and advisory fees paid to selected members of our sponsor group and we recorded a $52 million charge to operations
for in-process research and development. We recorded additional restructuring charges of $66 million to continue the alignment of our global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements. In connection
with the November 2000 transactions, our cash balances declined resulting in a lower level of interest income in this period and our predecessor repaid its long-term debt and we incurred new debt at higher interest rates resulting in a subsequently
higher level of interest expense.

We recorded a $9 million
provision for income taxes for the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001. The $9 million provision for income taxes differs from the benefit from income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% tax rate to the loss before
income taxes primarily due to the net effect of non-deductible charges related to the acquisition of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware, an increase in our allowance for U.S. deferred tax assets of certain subsidiaries, and income generated
from our manufacturing plants located in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand that operate under tax holidays (scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2010).


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and capital resources.

The 2002 Refinancing

In May 2002, we refinanced all of our then outstanding indebtedness. This
refinancing consisted of:

•

the repurchase of all of our $210 million principal amount 12½% senior subordinated notes due 2007;

•

the issuance and private placement of $400 million in principal amount of 8% senior notes due 2009 by Seagate Technology HDD Holdings and our unconditional guarantee, on a senior
unsecured basis, of such notes;

•

the repayment of approximately $673 million under our previously existing senior secured credit facilities;

•

the entry by Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, a direct subsidiary of Seagate Technology, and Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, an indirect subsidiary of Seagate Technology, into new
senior secured credit facilities, which consist of a $350 million term loan facility that has been drawn in full and a $150 million revolving credit facility, of which $31 million had been used for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’
guarantees as of June 27, 2003;

•

the distribution of $167 million to our shareholders who consisted of New SAC and employees who have exercised options granted under our share option plan; and

•

the payment of approximately $32 million to deferred compensation plan participants, consisting of members of the management group.

In connection with the 2002 refinancing, including the distribution of $32
million to deferred compensation plan participants in May 2002, we recognized $112 million of non-recurring expenses in the quarter ended June 28, 2002. This included:

•

a $93 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, which was comprised of:

•

$50 million related to the premium paid in the repurchase of Seagate Technology International’s 12


/


% senior subordinated
notes due 2007;

•

$7 million to write off unamortized discount on those notes;

•

$31 million to write off capitalized debt issuance costs on both the 12


/


% senior subordinated notes due 2007 and the former senior secured credit facilities of Seagate Technology International and Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc.;

•

a $4 million loss on an interest rate swap on one of the term loans included in the former senior secured credit facilities of Seagate Technology International and Seagate
Technology (US) Holdings, Inc.;

•

$1 million of other costs and expenses; and

•

$19 million of compensation expense related to the distribution of $32 million to deferred compensation plan participants, net of a $13 million income tax benefit.

The borrowers under the new senior secured
credit facility are Seagate Technology HDD Holdings and Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. Both of these companies are our wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiaries. The new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a first priority
pledge of substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of Seagate Technology HDD Holdings and many of its subsidiaries as well as a pledge of the shares of Seagate Technology HDD Holdings and many of its subsidiaries, which in the case of
non-U.S. subsidiaries of Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. is limited to a pledge of 65% of the shares of those subsidiaries, in each case subject to a number of exceptions. Seagate Technology and many of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of
Seagate Technology HDD Holdings have guaranteed the obligations under the credit agreement that governs our new senior secured credit facilities.


The credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities contains covenants that Seagate
Technology HDD Holdings, our wholly-owned subsidiary that operates our rigid disc drive business, must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement. These covenants require Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, among other things, to
maintain the following ratios: (1) an interest expense coverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least 2.50 to 1.00; (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio for any four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least (a) 1.25 to
1.00 for the period from June 30, 2002 to June 29, 2003 and (b) 1.50 to 1.00 for any period after June 30, 2003; and (3) a net leverage ratio of not more than 1.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter commencing on or after June 30, 2002. We
are currently in compliance with all of these covenants, including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain.

The calculated financial ratios for the quarter ended June 27, 2003 are as follows:

Required

June 27, 2003

Interest Coverage Ratio

Not less than 2.50

37.03

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

Not less than 1.25

(0.39

)

In connection with the
new senior credit facility, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings and Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. entered into a new $150 million revolving credit facility, under which $119 million was available to these entities for borrowing as of June 27,
2003. Although no borrowings have been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date, we had $31 million of outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees under this facility as of June 27, 2003.

On March 19, 2002, we paid a distribution of $33 million to our shareholders,
including New SAC, to enable New SAC to make a distribution of approximately $33 million to its shareholders, which allowed members of our sponsor group to satisfy tax obligations.

On May 20, 2002, we made a distribution to our shareholders, including New SAC, to enable New SAC to make a distribution to
its preferred shareholders. At approximately the same time, distributions were made to participants in Seagate Technology HDD Holdings’ deferred compensation plan. The aggregate amount of the shareholder distribution was approximately $167
million and the aggregate amount of the deferred compensation plan distribution was approximately $32 million.

The net effect of the 2002 refinancing and the distribution to our shareholders and participants in Seagate Technology HDD Holdings’ deferred
compensation plan in May 2002 was a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $419 million, consisting of an increase of $750 million from our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of our 8% senior notes, offset by
$1.169 billion of cash outlays.

On December 13, 2002,
immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, we made a distribution of approximately $262 million to our then-outstanding shareholders, including New SAC.

Pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy, we made distributions to our shareholders, including New SAC, of approximately
$13 million on each of February 28, 2003 and May 23, 2003.

The
degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances or other purposes and
could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures. Although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses,
products or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We will require
substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements. If we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or
cash flow from operations, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

Discussion of Cash Flows

At June 27, 2003, our working capital was $919 million, which included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.194 billion. Cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments increased $351 million from June 28, 2002 to June 27, 2003. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of our common shares offset by distributions
to shareholders and investments in property, equipment and leasehold improvements.


Cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2003 was $882 million and
consisted primarily of net income plus depreciation and amortization partially offset by payments of $147 million to participants in our deferred compensation plan.

During fiscal year 2003, we invested approximately $516 million in property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The $516
million investment comprised:

•

$212 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and test facilities in the United States and the Far East;

•

$132 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for our recording head operations in the United States, the Far East and Northern Ireland;

•

$144 million to upgrade the capabilities of our thin-film media operations in the United States, Singapore and Northern Ireland;

•

$17 million for the purchase of a corporate aircraft; and

•

$11 million for other purposes.

In fiscal year 2004, we anticipate that our investment in property and equipment will increase to approximately $650 million to $700 million. This
increase over our historic level is a result of our planned investment to expand our media production facility in Singapore. We expect our investment in subsequent years to return to budgeted levels of up to approximately $600 million per year. We
plan to finance these investments from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.

During the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002, we invested approximately $538 million in property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The $538 million investment comprised:

•

$275 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and test facilities in the United States and the Far East;

•

$149 million for our manufacturing facilities and equipment for the recording head operations in the United States, the Far East and Northern Ireland;

•

$84 million to upgrade the capabilities of our thin-film media operations in the United States, Singapore and Northern Ireland; and

•

$30 million for other purposes.

For the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $66 million. The primary contributors to the decrease
were the refinancing of all of our outstanding indebtedness, expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements, and shareholder distributions. These uses of cash were substantially offset by cash provided by operating activities.
During the quarter ended June 28, 2002, we repaid $883 million of long-term debt and refinanced it with $750 million of new long-term debt. Cash used to acquire property, equipment and leasehold improvements was $540 million for fiscal year 2002.
Shareholder distributions included $33 million paid to Seagate Delaware’s former stockholders in connection with the final accounting for the November 2000 transactions and $167 million paid to shareholders of Seagate Technology, consisting of
New SAC and certain employees. Cash provided by operating activities was $905 million and consisted primarily of net income plus depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts payable.

Until required for other purposes, our cash and cash equivalents are
maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our short-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the
time of purchase.


Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $882 million for fiscal year 2003, $905 million
for fiscal year 2002, $269 million for the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and $121 million for the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily
attributable to net income as adjusted for non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and deferred compensation payments. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted
for non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, deferred compensation and the write-off of debt issuance costs, and as adjusted to reclassify the cash payment for the redemption premium on the 12½% senior
subordinated notes to net cash used in financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001, was primarily attributable to a net loss, which was more than offset by net non-cash
charges such as depreciation, amortization and in-process research and development and a decrease in net operating assets. Net cash provided by operating activities during the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000 was primarily attributable
to a net loss, which was more than offset by net non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes and compensation expense related to the acceleration of vesting of stock options in connection with the November 2000
transactions.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing
activities was ($754) for fiscal year 2003, ($610) million for fiscal year 2002, ($1.140) billion for the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and $829 million for the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000. Net cash used in
investing activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements and the purchases of short-term investments in excess of maturities. Net cash used in investing activities for
fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Net cash used in investing activities during the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001, was primarily used to acquire property,
equipment and leasehold improvements, the purchase of the rigid disc drive and storage area networks divisions of our predecessor, and purchases of short-term investments in excess of maturities. Net cash provided by investment activities during the
period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000, was primarily attributable to net sales and maturities of investments offset by expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements and the establishment of a restricted cash account related
to the transaction with VERITAS.

Net cash provided by (used
in) financing activities was $9 million for fiscal year 2003, ($411) million for fiscal year 2002, $1.599 billion for the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and ($1.818) billion for the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000. Net
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to cash provided from the sale of our common shares partially offset by distributions to our shareholders. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year
2002 was primarily attributable to the refinancing and overall reduction of all of our outstanding indebtedness, payment of distributions to our shareholders and payment of the redemption premium on the 12


/


% senior subordinated notes. Net cash provided by financing activities during the period from November 23, 2000 to
June 29, 2001 was primarily a result of cash provided from the issuance of our term loans under our former senior secured credit facilities and 12


/


% senior subordinated notes and cash provided from the issuance of stock to our parent company. Net cash used in financing activities during the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000, was
attributable to excess cash provided to our predecessor’s parent company, Seagate Delaware, for distribution to its shareholders as a result of the November 2000 transactions and repayment of our predecessor’s senior notes and debentures.

Liquidity Sources and Cash Requirements
and Commitments

Consistent with our quarterly
dividend policy in effect at such time, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.03 per share, or approximately $13 million, which was paid on May 23, 2003 to all common shareholders of record as of May 9, 2003, including New
SAC.

On June 27, 2003, our board of directors amended our
quarterly dividend policy and, pursuant to our amended dividend policy, we expect to pay our shareholders a quarterly distribution of up to $0.04 per share ($0.16 annually) so long as the aggregate amount of the distributions does not exceed 50% of
our consolidated net income for the quarter in which the distributions are declared. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly distributions will be subject to, among other things, general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry, our
financial results, the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings, and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, including restrictions imposed by the
covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes. On July 14, 2003, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.04 per share to be paid on or before August 22, 2003 to our shareholders of record as of August 8,
2003.

Our principal sources of liquidity as of June 27, 2003
consisted of: (1) $1.194 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, (2) a $150 million revolving credit facility, of which $31 million had been used for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of June 27,
2003, and (3) cash we expect to generate from operations during this fiscal year.

Since the closing of the November 2000 transactions, our principal liquidity requirements have been to service our debt and meet our working capital, research and development and capital expenditure needs. In
addition, in the second half of fiscal year 2002 and through fiscal year 2003, we made distributions to our shareholders.


We believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash
requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations, performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing
economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, as part of our strategy, we intend to selectively pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions and investments that are complementary to
our business. Any material future acquisitions, alliances or investments will likely require additional capital. We cannot assure you that additional funds from available sources will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

Our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of June 27, 2003 have
been summarized in the table below (in millions):

Under operating leases
in the table above, we have included total future minimum rent expense under non-cancelable leases for both occupied and abandoned facilities (rent expense is shown net of sublease income).

Critical Accounting Policies

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical
accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and operating results, and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. Based on this definition, our most
critical policies include: establishment of sales program accruals, establishment of warranty accruals, and valuation of deferred tax assets. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have
other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts and valuation of inventory. We believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make
estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period.

Establishment of Sales Program Accruals.

We establish certain distributor sales programs aimed at increasing customer
demand. These programs are typically related to a distributor’s level of sales, order size and advertising or point of sale activity. We provide for these contra-revenues at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements.
These estimates are based on various factors, including estimated future price erosion, customer orders and sell-through levels, program participation and customer claim submittals. Significant variations in any of these factors could have a
material effect on our operating results.

In the third quarter
of fiscal year 2002, our North American distribution customers transitioned from a consignment model, under which we recognized revenue when distributors sold our products through to their customers, to a sell-in model, under which we recognize
revenue when our products are sold to distributors. This transition resulted from changes in our contractual arrangements with our North American distribution customers. As a result of these changes, title and risk of loss now pass to those
distributors at the time we ship our products to them, as compared to our former contractual arrangements under which title and risk of loss remained with us until our products were sold by the distributors. We effected the transition to a sell-in
model with respect to our North American distribution customers in an effort to improve our competitive position within the rigid disc drive industry by increasing the incentive of those distributors to sell our products through to their customers.
Although a limited right of return exists with respect to sales to our North American distribution customers, requiring us to make estimates of future returns, we believe that these estimates are reasonably accurate due to the short time period
during which our North American distribution customers can return our products, the limitations placed on their right to make returns, our long history of conducting business with distributors on a sell-in basis in Asia and Europe, the nature of our
historical relationships with our North American distribution customers and the daily reporting procedures through which we monitor inventory levels and sales to end-users. However, the failure of our distribution customers to sell our products to
end-users or our failure to accurately predict the level of future returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods.


Establishment of Warranty Accruals.

We estimate probable product warranty costs at the time
revenue is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years. We use estimated repair or replacement costs and use statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine our warranty obligation. We
exercise judgement in determining the underlying estimates. Should actual experience in any period differ significantly from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. The actual results with respect to warranty
expenditures could have a material adverse effect on us if the actual rate of unit failure is greater than what we used in estimating the warranty expense accrual.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets

. The recording of our deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on our
ability to generate current and future taxable income in the United States. Each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only
to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”) and SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). The provisions of SFAS 141 apply to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The adoption of SFAS 141 had no effect on our consolidated financial position or
results of operations in fiscal year 2002. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized; however, these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets with
finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives. The provisions of SFAS 142 are effective for our fiscal year 2003. The adoption of SFAS 142 had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations in fiscal year 2003.

In October 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”). SFAS 144 amends existing accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides an accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of. We adopted SFAS 144 in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2003. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved. The adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). The Interpretation will significantly change current practice in the accounting for,
and disclosure of, guarantees. The Interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value, which is different from current practice, which is generally to record a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as
those terms are defined in FASB Statement No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”. The Interpretation also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is
remote, which is another change from current practice. We adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 in the quarter ended December 27, 2002. See Note 14, Product Warranty. We adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45
prospectively in the quarter ended March 28, 2003.

In December
2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”). SFAS 148 amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), to
provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS 123’s fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial
Reporting,” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual
and interim financial statements. While SFAS 148 does not amend SFAS 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method, the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are applicable to all companies with stock-based
employee compensation, regardless of whether they account for the compensation using the fair value method of SFAS 123 or the intrinsic value method of APBO 25. We adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 in the quarter ended March 28, 2003
and we will continue to use the intrinsic value method described in ABPO 25 in accounting for the fair value of stock awards issued to employees.


In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parities. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities
created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2004. We do not believe that the
adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (“FAS
149”) which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under FAS 133. FAS 149 is effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 except for the provisions that were cleared by the FASB in prior pronouncements. We do not expect the provision of this statement to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial
position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In accordance with the standard, financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities. This Statement shall be effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise shall be effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2004. We do not expect the provision of this statement to have a significant impact on our results of
operations or financial position.


Risk Factors

Risks Related to Our Business

Competition—Our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced significant price erosion.

Even during periods when demand is stable, the rigid disc drive industry is
intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product. Our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and
customers, and we expect these practices to continue. We may need to reduce our prices to retain our market share, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product
introductions, we believe that the rate of increase in areal density, or the storage capacity per square inch on a disc, is slowing from its previous levels. This trend may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent that historical
price erosion patterns continue, product life cycles are lengthened and we are unable to offset these factors with new product introductions at higher average prices. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Moreover, a significant portion of our success over the past two fiscal years
is a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors. Our current market share may be negatively affected by our customers’ preference to diversify their sources of supply or if they decide to meet their requirements by
manufacturing rigid disc drives themselves, particularly in the enterprise sector. Any significant increase in market share by one of our competitors would likely result in a decline in our market share, which could adversely affect our results of
operations.

Principal Competitors—We compete with
both captive manufacturers, who do not depend solely on sales of rigid disc drives to maintain their profitability, and independent manufacturers, whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced rigid disc drives.

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition
from a number of domestic and foreign companies, including other independent rigid disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as:

The term “independent” in
this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce rigid disc drives as a stand-alone product, and the term “captive” refers to rigid disc drive manufacturers that produce complete computer or other systems that contain rigid disc
drives or other information storage products. Captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components. Because components other
than rigid disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do rigid disc drives, captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the rigid disc drives included in a
computer system and, as a result, may be willing to sell rigid disc drives to third parties at very low margins. Many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do. To the extent we are
not successful competing with captive or independent rigid disc drive manufacturers, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

In addition, in response to customer demand for high-quality, high-volume and low-cost rigid disc drives, manufacturers of rigid disc drives have had to
develop large, in some cases global, production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls. The development of large production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of
competition. We also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own rigid disc drives or other information storage products.


Industry Consolidation—Consolidation among captive manufacturers may serve to increase their
resources and improve their access to customers, thereby making them more formidable competitors.

Consolidation among captive manufacturers may provide them with competitive advantages over independent manufacturers, including us. For example, IBM
recently merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of Hitachi through the formation of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, a separate company that currently is 70% owned by Hitachi. As a part of this transaction, each of IBM and
Hitachi has agreed to multi-year supply commitments with the new company. Because IBM is one of our most significant customers and Hitachi is one of our most significant competitors, there is a significant risk that IBM will decrease the number of
rigid disc drives purchased from us and increase the number purchased from the new company. Moreover, economies of scale and the combination of the two companies’ technological capabilities, particularly in the enterprise sector of our
industry, could make the new company a more formidable competitor than IBM or Hitachi operating alone.

Volatility of Quarterly Results—Our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause our stock
price to decline.

In the past, our quarterly revenue
and operating results fluctuated significantly from period to period. We expect this fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons, including:

•

changes in the demand for the computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our rigid disc drives, due to seasonality and other factors;

•

changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers;

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices, a condition that is exacerbated when competitors exit the industry or specific product lines and liquidate their remaining
inventory;

•

adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the United States and other major regions in which we do business;

•

our high proportion of fixed costs, including research and development expenses;

•

delays or problems in the introduction of our new products;

•

announcements of new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors;

•

increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies;

•

the impact of external factors, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, on customer demand or on our operations; and

•

the ability of our competition to regain their recent market share losses, particularly with respect to enterprise products, through the introduction of technologically advanced
products and their ability to improve their operational execution.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance. Our
operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors, which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares.


Industry Demand—Slowdown in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems has caused and
may continue to cause a decline in demand for our products.

Our rigid disc drives are components in computers, computer systems and storage subsystems. The demand for these products has been volatile. In a weak economy, consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for PCs tends to decrease,
as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems. Currently, demand for rigid disc drives in the enterprise sector is being adversely impacted as a result of the weakened economy and because enterprises have shifted their focus
from making new equipment purchases to more efficiently using their existing information technology infrastructure through, among other things, adopting new storage architectures. Unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems and storage
subsystems have generally caused sharp declines in demand for rigid disc drive products. During economic slowdowns such as the one that began in 2001, our industry has experienced periods in which the supply of rigid disc drives has exceeded demand.

Additional causes of declines in demand for our products in
the past have included announcements or introductions of major operating system or semiconductor improvements. We believe these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory
obsolete. Whenever an oversupply of rigid disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels, we experience even more intense price competition from other rigid disc drive manufacturers than usual.

Seasonality—Because we experience seasonality in
the sales of our products, our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the summer months.

Because sales of computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal, we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our
business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for rigid disc drives. In particular, we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the summer months than the rest of the year. In the desktop computer,
notebook computer and consumer electronics sectors of our business, this seasonality is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales during the winter holiday season of PCs and consumer electronics. In the enterprise sector of our
business, our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users. Because our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been
received, our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate. Furthermore, it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods
because our overall growth may have reduced the impact of this seasonality in recent periods.

Difficulty in Predicting Quarterly Demand—If we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter, we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments.

The rigid disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles, with
much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter. Our manufacturing process requires us to make significant product-specific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production. Because we
typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments, there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that
investment have become obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future. Other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include:

•

our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy, which means that we make more capital investments than we would
if we were not vertically integrated;

•

the timing of orders from and shipment of products to key customers;

•

our product mix and the related margins of the various products;

•

accelerated reduction in the price of our rigid disc drives due to technological advances and an oversupply of rigid disc drives in the market, a condition that is exacerbated when
competitors exit the industry or specific product lines and liquidate their remaining inventory;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions, particularly at our major manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand;

•

variations in the cost of components for our products;

•

limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers;


•

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers; and

•

operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes.

Variable Product Life Cycles—The variability of product life cycles can make planning product transitions
difficult.

Historically the rate of increase of areal
density has grown rapidly; however, recently this rate of increase is slowing. Higher areal densities mean that fewer read/write heads and rigid discs are required to achieve a given rigid disc drive storage capacity. In addition, advances in
computer hardware and software have led to the demand for successive generations of storage products with increased storage capacity and/or improved performance and reliability. As a result, product life cycles shortened because of recent rapid
increases in areal density. The introduction of new rigid disc drives requires us to engage in new product qualifications with our customers and we expect to engage in several competitive product qualifications during the balance of this calendar
year, particularly with respect to our notebook products, and on an ongoing basis in future years. Short product cycles make it more difficult to recover the cost of product development because those costs must be recovered over increasingly shorter
periods of time during the life cycles of products.

In
contrast to historical trends, based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions, we believe that the current rate of increase in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years. We believe
that this slowdown in the rate of increase in areal density will continue until a significant advance in technology for the electronic storage of data, such as perpendicular recording technology, becomes commercially available. When the rate of
increase in areal density slows, it may contribute to increased average price erosion to the extent historical price erosion patterns continue, product life cycles are lengthened and our ability to introduce new products at higher prices is limited.
In addition, the variability of product life cycles can make planning product transitions more difficult. To the extent that we prematurely discontinue a product, or do not timely introduce new products, our operating results may be adversely
affected.

New Product Offerings—Market acceptance
of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted, and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated.

We are continually developing new products in the hope that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced rigid disc
drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors. The success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products.
Accordingly, we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our sales or results of operations.

In addition, the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our original
equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers. In order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification, we must be among the leaders in time-to-market with those new products. Once a product is accepted for qualification testing,
any failure or delay in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced. The effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high-volume OEMs.
These risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products. We cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in time-to-market with new
products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future.

Smaller Form Factor Rigid Disc Drives—If we do not successfully market smaller form factor rigid disc drives, our business may suffer.

Increases in sales of notebook computers and in areal
density are resulting in a shift to smaller form factor rigid disc drives for an expanding number of applications, including PCs, enterprise storage applications and consumer electronics. These applications have typically used rigid disc drives with
a 3.5-inch form factor, which we currently manufacture. Notebook computers typically use 2.5-inch form factor rigid disc drives. Although we are currently shipping notebook drives to OEMs, we currently have not completed qualification programs with
a number of OEMs which are material to the success of these products. Furthermore, our announced products only address a limited portion of the existing notebook market. We cannot assure you that we will receive additional qualifications or that we
will be able to successfully compete in the market for smaller form factor rigid disc drives. If we do not suitably adapt our technology and product offerings to successfully develop and introduce smaller form factor rigid disc drives, customers may
decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase.


Importance of Time-to-Market—Our operating results depend on our being among the
first-to-market and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products.

To achieve consistent success with our OEM customers, we must be an early provider of new types of rigid disc drives featuring leading, high-quality technology. Our operating results in the past two years have
substantially depended, and in the future will substantially depend, upon our ability to be among the first-to-market with new product offerings. Our market share will be adversely affected, which would harm our operating results, if we fail to:

•

consistently maintain or improve our time-to-market performance with our new products;

•

produce these products in sufficient volume;

•

qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers’ performance and quality specifications; or

•

achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and costs with these products.

If delivery of our products is delayed, our OEM customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements. If the delay of our products
causes delivery of those OEMs’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed, consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the OEMs’ competitors.

Moreover, we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to
make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released. If this were to occur, we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may have become less efficient and cost effective
compared to new products. As a result, even if we are among the first-to-market with a given product, subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on
our investment in existing products and inventory.

Importance of Reducing Operating Costs—If we do not reduce our operating expenses, we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry.

Our strategy involves, to a substantial degree, increasing revenue while at the same time reducing operating expenses. In
furtherance of this strategy, we have engaged in ongoing, company-wide manufacturing efficiency activities intended to increase productivity and reduce costs. These activities have included closures and transfers of facilities, significant personnel
reductions and efforts to increase automation. We cannot assure you that our efforts will result in the increased profitability, cost savings or other benefits that we expect. Moreover, the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may
adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service. In addition, the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product
to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new facility by some of our OEM customers. We cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a cost-effective basis without delays or disruption in our
production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships and results of operations.

New Product Development and Technological Change—If we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes, our operating
results will be adversely affected.

Our customers
have demanded new generations of rigid disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity, improved performance and reliability of
smaller form factors. We and our competitors have developed improved products, and we will need to continue to do so in the future. For fiscal years 2002 and 2003, we had product development expenses of $698 million and $670 million, respectively.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner, that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields, that we
will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a long-term basis.

When we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology, our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and
complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems. If our products suffer increases in failures, are of low quality or are not reliable, customers may reduce their purchases
of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase. In addition, a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other rigid disc drive manufacturers.


Impact of Technological Change—Increases in the areal density of disc drives may outpace
customers’ demand for storage capacity.

The rate
of increase in areal density, or storage capacity per square inch on a disc, may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity. As a result, our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with
fewer rigid disc drives. In addition, as areal densities have increased, delivering products with the reliability and performance characteristics, as well as manufacturing yields, of prior product generations has become increasingly difficult. This
may cause our OEM customers to delay transitions to our newer product offerings. These factors could decrease our sales, especially when combined with continued price erosion, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in Information Storage Products—Future changes in the
nature of information storage products may reduce demand for traditional rigid disc drive products.

We expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed, some of which, such as Internet appliances, may not contain a
rigid disc drive. While we are investing development resources in designing information storage products for new applications, it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for rigid disc drive products. We cannot
assure you that we will be successful in developing other information storage products. In addition, there are currently no widely accepted standards in various technical areas that may be important to the future of our business, including the
developing sector of intelligent storage solutions. Products using alternative technologies, such as semiconductor memory, optical storage and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of
our products.

For example, semiconductor memory is much faster
than rigid disc drives, but currently is volatile in that it is subject to loss of data in the event of power failure and is much more costly than rigid disc drive technologies. Flash EEPROM, a nonvolatile semiconductor memory, is currently much
more costly than rigid disc drive technologies and, while it has higher read performance than rigid disc drives, it has lower write performance. Flash EEPROM could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage
capacity than is required in traditional markets for our products.

High
Fixed Costs—Our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs.

Our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs and requires a high volume of production and sales to be successful. During periods
of decreased production, these high fixed costs have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. For example, in 1998 our predecessor experienced a significant decrease in the demand
for its products, and because our predecessor was unable to adequately reduce its costs to offset this decrease in revenue, its gross and operating margins suffered. In addition, a strategy of vertical integration has in the past and could in the
future delay our ability to introduce products containing market-leading technology, because we may not have developed the technology and source of components for our products and do not have access to external sources of supply without incurring
substantial costs.

Research and development expenses represent
a significant portion of our fixed costs. As part of our vertical integration strategy, we explore a broad range of ways to improve rigid disc drives as well as possible alternatives to rigid disc drives for storing and retrieving electronic data.
If we fail to develop new technologies in a timely manner, and our competitors succeed in doing so, our ability to sell our products could be significantly diminished. Conversely, if we over invest in technologies that can never be profitably
manufactured and marketed, our results of operations could suffer. By way of example, we have incurred expenses in exploring new technologies for storing electronic data, including perpendicular recording technology, which involves a different
orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in rigid disc drives, and heat assisted magnetic recording technology, which uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity. We believe these new technologies could significantly
improve the storage capacity of rigid disc drives over the long-term. To date, we have not yet developed a commercial product based on these technologies. Furthermore, based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product
introductions, we believe that the rate of increase of areal density is slowing as compared to its previous levels, which has lengthened the life cycles of existing products and may further postpone returns on our investments in new technologies. If
we have invested too much in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, as we replace our existing assets with new, higher cost assets, we expect that our depreciation expense will increase, which will
contribute to our high level of fixed costs and reduce our earnings. This could cause the market price of our common shares to decline.


Dependence on Supply of Equipment and Components—If we experience shortages or delays in the
receipt of critical equipment or components necessary to manufacture our products, we may suffer lower operating margins, production delays and other material adverse effects.

The cost, quality and availability of some equipment and components used to manufacture rigid disc drives and other
information storage products are critical to the successful manufacture of these products. The equipment we use to manufacture our products is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers. Particularly important components include
read/write heads, recording media, application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, spindle motors and printed circuit boards. We rely on sole suppliers and a limited number of suppliers for some of these components, including the read/write
heads and recording media that we do not manufacture, ASICs, spindle motors and printed circuit boards. In the past, we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient
quantities of some components and have been forced to pay higher prices for some components that were in short supply in the industry in general.

For example, during the months preceding the November 2000 transactions, Seagate Delaware’s ability to satisfy customer demand was constrained by a
limited supply of electrical components from external suppliers. Due to the recent downturn in the economy in general and in the technology sector of the economy in particular, the rigid disc drive industry has experienced economic pressure, which
has resulted in consolidation among component manufacturers and may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components. These events could affect our ability to
obtain critical components for our products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

If there is a shortage of, or delay in supplying us with, critical components, then:

•

it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and, if we could not pass these price increases to our customers, our operating margin would decline;

•

we might have to reengineer some products, which would likely cause production and shipment delays, make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of
return on these products;

•

we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others, which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to
customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations; and

•

we might be late in shipping products, causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors and, thus, causing our revenue and operating margin to decline.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical
components in a timely and economic manner, or at all.

Dependence on Key Customers—We may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced, delayed or cancelled purchases by, one or more of our larger customers.

For fiscal years 2002 and 2003, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 63% and 63%, respectively, of our rigid
disc drive revenue. Compaq Computer Corporation, together with Hewlett-Packard, accounted for approximately 20% of our rigid disc drive revenue for fiscal year 2002, and Hewlett-Packard accounted for approximately 18% of our rigid disc drive revenue
for fiscal year 2003. If any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us, our results of operations would be adversely affected. While sales to major customers may vary from period to period, a major customer that
permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace. In line with industry practice, new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at the customer’s
cost. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to attract new major customers.

Customer Concentration—Consolidation among our customers could cause sales of our products to decline.

Mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers generally entail risks to our business. For example, IBM,
which is one of our key customers, recently merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of Hitachi through the formation of a new company with which IBM has entered into a multi-year supply agreement. As a result, IBM may decrease
its purchases from us in favor of this new company. If a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.


OEM Purchase Agreements—Our OEM customers are not obligated to purchase our products.

Typically, our OEM purchase agreements permit OEMs to
cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates without significant penalties. In the past, orders from many of our OEMs were cancelled and delivery schedules were delayed as a result of changes in the requirements of the OEMs’ customers. These
order cancellations and delays in delivery schedules have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the past and may do so again in the future. Our OEMs and distributors typically furnish us with non-binding indications of their
near term requirements, with product deliveries based on weekly confirmations. If actual orders from distributors and OEMs decrease from their non-binding forecasts, these variances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

Economic
Risks Associated with International Operations—Our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations, longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries, seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets,
tariffs and duties, price controls, potential adverse tax consequences, increased costs, our customers’ credit and access to capital and health-related risks.

We have significant operations in foreign countries, including manufacturing facilities, sales personnel and customer
support operations. For fiscal years 2002 and 2003, approximately 31% and 31%, respectively, of our rigid disc drive revenue were from sales to customers located in Europe and approximately 30% and 35%, respectively, were from sales to customers
located in the Far East. We have manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Singapore and Thailand, in addition to those in the United States. A substantial portion of our desktop rigid disc drive assembly occurs in our facility
in China.

Our international operations are subject to economic
risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including the following:

•

Disruptions in Foreign Markets.

Disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some countries, including those in
Asia, have had an impact on our sales to customers located in, or whose end-user customers are located in, these countries.

•

Fluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates.

Prices for our products are denominated predominately in U.S. dollars, even when sold to customers that are located outside the
United States. Currency instability in Asian and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency. Moreover, many of the costs associated with our
operations located outside the United States are denominated in local currencies. As a consequence, the increased strength of local currencies against the U.S. dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher effective
operating costs and, potentially, reduced earnings. Currently, we do not hedge our foreign exchange risk. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will not have a negative effect on our operations and profitability.

•

Longer Payment Cycles.

Our customers outside of the United States are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our U.S. customers. This increases the risk of
nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period.

•

Seasonality.

Seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months, particularly in Europe, typically result in lower earnings during those
periods.

•

Tariffs, Duties, Limitations on Trade and Price Controls.

Our international operations are affected by limitations on imports, currency exchange control regulations, transfer
pricing regulations, price controls and other restraints on trade. In addition, the governments of many countries, including China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, in which we have significant operating assets, have exercised and continue to
exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade.

•

Potential Adverse Tax Consequences.

Our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on
payments by subsidiaries.

•

Increased Costs.

The shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our U.S. operations,
resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries.

•

Credit and Access to Capital Risks.

Our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates, reduced bank lending resulting from
contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer’s or its bank’s financial condition, or the inability to access other financing.


•

Health-Related Risks.

We have manufacturing facilities in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, all of which are areas that have recently experienced outbreaks of SARS. An
outbreak of SARS in or near any of our facilities could result in the quarantine or closure of such a facility and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Political Risks Associated with International Operations—Our
international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism.

We have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest. This could disrupt our ability to manufacture
important components as well as cause interruptions and/or delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly. Any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and
have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. U.S. and international responses to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the ongoing hostilities in Afghanistan and Iraq and the risk of hostilities with North Korea
could exacerbate these risks.

Legal and Operational
Risks Associated with International Operations—Our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management, legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property.

Operating outside of the United States creates difficulties associated with
staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities, complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance
with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject. We also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified.

Conflicts of Interest of our Directors and Officers—Our directors
and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of capital stock of, and their employment with, our parent company and our affiliates.

Many of our directors and executive officers hold ordinary shares of our parent company, New SAC, and some of them hold
shares of capital stock and options to purchase the capital stock of our affiliate, Crystal Decisions, Inc., a business intelligence software solutions company. Ownership of the capital stock of our parent company and our affiliates by our directors
and officers could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and for New SAC or our affiliates.

Some of our directors also serve on the board of New SAC, and on the boards
of Certance Holdings, a tape drive company, and Crystal Decisions, a software company, both of which are owned by New SAC. Several of our executive officers also serve as officers and/or directors of those entities as well as of other affiliates of
ours. In view of these overlapping relationships, conflicts of interest may exist or arise with respect to existing and future business dealings, including the relative commitment of time and energy by our directors and officers to us and to our
parent company and affiliates, potential acquisitions of businesses or properties and other business opportunities, the issuance of additional securities, the election of new or additional directors and the payment of distributions by us. We cannot
assure you that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor.

Risks Associated with Future Acquisitions—We may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliance, acquisition or investment opportunities, or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide
complementary products or technologies.

Our growth
strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with, and making acquisitions of or investments in, other companies that are complementary to our business. There is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance, acquisition and
investment candidates. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates. Even if we were able to identify them, we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with, acquire or invest in
suitable candidates, or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations. Our ability to finance potential acquisitions will be limited by our high degree of leverage, the covenants contained
in the indenture that governs our outstanding 8% senior notes, the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur.

If we are successful in acquiring other companies, these acquisitions may
have an adverse effect on our operating results, particularly while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated. It is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies
or the loss of customers of those companies. In addition, the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management, which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our day-to-day
operations or to the execution of our strategy. Furthermore, the expansion of our business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively, that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments and that
we would incur substantial charges relating to the write-off of in-process research and development, similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions. Each of these items could have a material adverse effect on
our financial position and results of operations.


Potential Loss of Licensed Technology—The closing of the November 2000 transactions may have
triggered change of control or anti-assignment provisions in some of our license agreements, which could result in a loss of our right to use licensed technology.

We have a number of cross-licenses with third parties that enable us to manufacture our products free from any infringement
claims that might otherwise be made by these third parties against us. A number of these licenses contain change of control or anti-assignment provisions. We have taken steps to transfer these licenses in connection with the closing of the November
2000 transactions; however, we cannot assure you that these transfers will not be challenged. For example, Papst Licensing GmbH, IBM and Hitachi initially took the position that their license agreements did not transfer to our new business entities.
Subsequently, we entered into new license agreements with IBM and Hitachi in December 2001. In September 2002, we settled a broader dispute with Papst that also resolved the claim by Papst that its license agreement was not properly transferred.

We received a letter dated November 20, 2002 from Read-Rite
Corporation asserting that we do not currently have a license to its patented technology and that our rigid disc drive products infringe at least two of its patents. We have since received additional letters from Read-Rite Corporation making the
same claims. Seagate Delaware entered into a Patent Cross License Agreement dated December 31, 1994, which covered the two patents referenced in the November 20 letter, as well as other intellectual property of Read-Rite Corporation. Prior to the
November 20, 2002 letter, Read-Rite Corporation had not responded to our efforts to confirm that under the Patent Cross License Agreement we were entitled to a new license agreement in our own name and on materially the same terms as the 1994
agreement.

In order to clarify the parties’ rights under
the Patent Cross License Agreement, we filed a declaratory judgment action on May 7, 2003 in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, seeking a declaration that we are entitled to a cross-license, effective as of November 22, 2000,
under terms substantially identical to those contained in the Patent Cross License Agreement. On June 11, 2003 Read-Rite Corporation answered the complaint putting forward a general denial and asserting various affirmative defenses. On June 17,
2003, Read-Rite Corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon notice, our declaratory judgment action has been stayed. On July 23, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bid of Western
Digital Corporation to acquire the assets of Read-Rite Corporation, including the intellectual property that was the subject of Read-Rite’s assertions against us, in a transaction which closed on July 31, 2003.

To the extent that third party cross-licenses, including the Patent Cross
License Agreement dated December 31, 1994 between Read-Rite Corporation and Seagate Delaware, are deemed not to have been properly assigned to us in the November 2000 transactions, our inability to either obtain new licenses or transfer existing
licenses could result in delays in product development or prevent us from selling our products until equivalent substitute technology can be identified, licensed and/or integrated or until we are able to substantially engineer our products to avoid
infringing the rights of third parties. We might not be able to renegotiate agreements, be able to obtain necessary licenses in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our products successfully. Moreover, the loss
of or inability to extend any of these licenses would increase the risk of infringement claims being made against us, which claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Risk of Intellectual Property Litigation—Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others,
which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.

We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Historically, patent applications in the United States and some foreign countries
have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology. If patents are later issued on these applications, we may be liable for
infringement. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our
products. We are currently subject to a suit by Convolve, Inc. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a suit pending in Nanjing, China. In addition, as noted above, Read-Rite Corporation, in a letter dated November 20, 2002 and in
correspondence since that date, asserted that we do not currently have a license to Read-Rite Corporation patented technology and that our rigid disc drive products infringe at least two Read-Rite Corporation patents. We filed a declaratory judgment
action in the Superior Court of California, seeking to clarify our rights to Read-Rite Corporation’s patented technology. Read-Rite Corporation responded by filing a general denial and asserting various affirmative defenses. On June 17, 2003,
Read-Rite Corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and, pursuant to a notice we received on June 19, 2003, our declaratory judgment action has been stayed. On July 23, 2003, the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court approved the bid of Western Digital Corporation to acquire the assets of Read-Rite Corporation, including the intellectual property that was the subject of Read-Rite’s assertions against us, in a transaction which closed on
July 31, 2003.


Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim,
and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business. In addition, intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot assure you that we
will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. Moreover, software patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the
field. If we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We might not be able to
obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to reengineer our products successfully. Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and lose the suit, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from
using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products.

Dependence on Intellectual Property—If our intellectual property and other proprietary information were copied or independently developed by
competitors, our operating results would be negatively affected.

Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve the proprietary aspects of our technology. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our
authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States, or protect us from independently developing or acquiring technology that is similar to ours. For example, in its
bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Read-Rite Corporation’s patents and other intellectual property rights were sold to Western Digital Corporation, who will use this intellectual property to compete against us.
The use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect
these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail.

Limitations on Patent Protection—Our issued and pending patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property or provide us with any competitive advantage.

Although we have numerous U.S. and foreign patents and numerous pending
patents that relate to our technology, we cannot assure you that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Moreover, our competitors may already have applied for
patents that, once issued, will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our products in the United States or abroad. Our competitors also may attempt to design around our patents or copy or otherwise obtain and use our
proprietary technology. With respect to our pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims. Our failure to secure these patents may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these
applications were intended to cover.

Disclosure of our
Proprietary Technology—Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or trade secrets.

We have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers and potential strategic
partners, among others. If any party to these agreements were to violate their agreement with us and disclose our proprietary technology to a third party, we may be unable to prevent the third party from using this information. Because a significant
portion of our proprietary technology consists of specialized knowledge and technical expertise developed by our employees, we have a program in place designed to ensure that our employees communicate any developments or discoveries they make to
other employees. However, employees may choose to leave our company before transferring their knowledge and expertise to our other employees. Violations by others of our confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements and the loss of employees who have
specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline. Our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by others, and trade secret laws provide no remedy
against independent development or discovery.

Service
Marks and Trademarks—Our failure to obtain trademark registrations or service marks, or challenges to those marks, could impede our marketing efforts.

We have registered and applied for some service marks and trademarks, and will continue to evaluate the registration of
additional service marks and trademarks, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee the approval of any of our pending applications by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to
oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries could limit our ability to use our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions.


Environmental Matters—We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and
civil or criminal sanctions, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws.

Our operations inside and outside the United States are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those
governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. In addition to the U.S. federal, state and local laws to which our domestic
operations are subject, our extensive international manufacturing operations subject us to environmental regulations imposed by foreign governments.

Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the United States, we could incur
substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or become non-compliant with environmental
permits required at our facilities. Contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites, principally in connection with historical operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several
superfund sites. While we are not currently aware of any contaminated or superfund sites as to which material outstanding claims or obligations exist, the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at
these or other sites could result in significant liability. In addition, the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. Liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can
be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. In other words, one liable party could be held liable for all costs at a site. Potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with environmental laws that may be
adopted or imposed in the future.

Dependence on Key
Personnel—The loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects.

Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing, sales and product
development personnel. The loss of one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to
attract, retain and further incentivize highly skilled management, marketing, sales and product development personnel. A significant portion of the incentive compensation for our senior management vests in calendar year 2003 and substantially all of
this compensation will have vested by November 2004. We may not be able to provide our senior management with adequate additional incentives to remain employed by us after this time. We have experienced intense competition for personnel, and we
cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining personnel in the future.

System Failures—System failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and
electronic data on which our operations depend.

Our
operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by, among other things, earthquake, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized
intrusion and other catastrophic events. As our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent, our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase. A significant part of our operations is based in an area of
California that has experienced power outages and earthquakes and is considered seismically active. We do not have a contingency plan for addressing the kinds of events referred to in this paragraph that would be sufficient to prevent system
failures and other interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Potential Tax Legislation—Negative publicity about companies located in certain offshore jurisdictions may lead to new legislation that could
increase our tax burden.

Several members of the
United States Congress have introduced legislation relating to the U.S. federal tax treatment of U.S. companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions. While we do not believe that this legislation, as currently proposed,
would adversely affect us, the exact scope of the legislation and whether it will ultimately be enacted is unclear at this time. In addition, certain state legislatures have proposed similar legislation. Therefore, it is possible that federal or
state legislation in this area, if enacted, could materially increase our future tax burden or otherwise affect our business.


Risks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness

Substantial Leverage—Our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry.

We are leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. Our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. For example, our high level of debt presents
the following risks to you:

•

we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements;

•

our interest expense could increase if prevailing interest rates increase, because a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at floating rates;

•

our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared
to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;

•

our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other
business opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies;

•

our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic
acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and

•

covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay distributions or make other restricted payments and investments.

Significant Debt Service
Requirements—Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control.

Our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on, our
indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements. Our ability to generate
cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that:

•

our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;

•

we will continue to realize the cost savings, revenue growth and operating improvements that resulted from the execution of our long-term strategic plan; or

•

future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facilities or that other sources of funding will be available to us, in each case, in amounts sufficient to
enable us to fund our liquidity needs.

If we
cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt,
or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant amount of
additional debt. If we incur additional debt above the levels now in effect, the risks associated with our substantial leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs,
could intensify.


Restrictions Imposed by Debt Covenants—Restrictions imposed by our existing debt instruments
will limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.

Our existing debt instruments, including the indenture governing our outstanding 8% senior notes, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose,
operating and other restrictions on us. The indenture governing our 8% notes limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if our consolidated coverage ratio, which is the ratio of the aggregate consolidated EBITDA of our subsidiary, Seagate
Technology HDD Holdings, the issuer of our 8% senior notes, and its restricted subsidiaries, to the total interest expense of those entities, is less than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0 during any consecutive four-quarter period. Our existing debt
instruments also limit, among other things, our ability to:

•

pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our shares;

•

redeem or repurchase shares;

•

make investments or other restricted payments;

•

sell assets;

•

issue or sell shares of restricted subsidiaries;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

create liens;

•

enter into sale/leaseback transactions;

•

effect a consolidation or merger; and

•

make certain amendments to our deferred compensation plans.

These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions that permit us to make significant distributions
of cash. In addition, the obligation to comply with many of the covenants under the indenture governing our 8% senior notes will cease to apply if the notes achieve investment grade status.

Our existing debt instruments also require us to achieve specified financial
and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control.

A breach of any of the restrictive covenants described above or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios
could result in a default under our existing debt instruments. If a default occurs, the holders of our outstanding 8% senior notes may elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be
immediately due and payable. If our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any future indebtedness, which would cause the market price of our common
shares to decline significantly.


Risks Related to Our Common Shares

Control by Our Sponsor Group—Because our sponsor group, through its ownership of New SAC, will continue to hold a
controlling interest in us, the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited.

After the secondary public offering of our common shares by New SAC in July 2003, affiliates of Silver Lake Partners, Texas Pacific Group, August Capital,
J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC and investment partnerships affiliated with Goldman, Sachs & Co. indirectly own approximately 20.0%, 14.2%, 7.3%, 4.2% and 1.4%, respectively, of our outstanding common shares through their ownership of New SAC. The
sponsors’ ownership of New SAC and New SAC’s and the sponsors’ ownership of us is the subject of shareholders agreements and other arrangements that result in the sponsors’ acting as a group with respect to all matters submitted
to our shareholders. As a result, the members of our sponsor group will continue to have the power to:

•

control all matters submitted to our shareholders;

•

elect our directors; and

•

exercise control over our business, policies and affairs.

Also, New SAC is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party.

Accordingly, our ability to engage in significant transactions, such as a merger, acquisition or liquidation, is limited
without the consent of members of our sponsor group. Conflicts of interest could arise between us and our sponsor group, and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us. The members of our sponsor group may continue
to retain control of us for the foreseeable future and may decide not to enter into a transaction in which you would receive consideration for your common shares that is much higher than the cost to you or the then-current market price of those
shares. In addition, the members of our sponsor group could elect to sell a controlling interest in us and you may receive less than the then-current fair market value or the price you paid for your shares. Any decision regarding their ownership of
us that members of our sponsor group may make at some future time will be in their absolute discretion.

Future Sales—Additional sales of our common shares by New SAC, our sponsors or our employees or issuances by us in connection with future
acquisitions or otherwise could cause the price of our common shares to decline.

If New SAC or – after any distribution to our sponsors of our shares by New SAC – our sponsors sell a substantial number of our common shares in the future, the market price of our common shares could
decline. The perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect. New SAC and our sponsors have rights, subject to specified conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering common shares or to
include common shares in registration statements that we may file. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of common shares, New SAC or any of the sponsors could cause the price of our common shares to decline.
Furthermore, if we were to include common shares in a registration statement initiated by us, those additional shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common shares.

One component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions. In the event
of any future acquisitions, we could issue additional common shares, which would have the effect of diluting your percentage ownership of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline.


Volatile Public Markets—The price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline
significantly.

The stock market in general, and the
market for technology stocks in particular, has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. If these market or industry-based fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares
could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance, and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors,
including among others:

•

actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;

•

announcements of innovations, new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors;

•

our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts;

•

the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;

•

general stock market conditions;

•

the occurrence of major catastrophic events; and

•

changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts.

Failure to Pay Quarterly Distributions—Our failure to pay quarterly distributions to our common shareholders could cause the market price of
our common shares to decline significantly.

In
accordance with our quarterly dividend policy in effect at such time, our board of directors declared and paid quarterly distributions of $0.03 per share, or approximately $13 million, to all of our shareholders of record as of each of February 14,
2003 and May 9, 2003, including New SAC. On June 27, 2003, our board of directors amended our dividend policy and, pursuant to our amended policy, we expect to pay our shareholders a quarterly distribution of up to $0.04 per share ($0.16 annually)
so long as the aggregate amount of the distributions do not exceed 50% of our consolidated net income for the quarter in which the distributions are declared. On July 14, 2003, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.04 per
share to be paid on or before August 22, 2003 to our shareholders of record as of August 8, 2003.

Our ability to pay quarterly distributions will be subject to, among other things, general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry, our
financial results, the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings, and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, including restrictions imposed by the
covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities. Any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly distributions could cause the market price of our common shares to
decline significantly. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly distributions is reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying distributions at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our
common shares.

Taxation of Distributions—Certain
U.S. shareholders may be ineligible for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment on distributions on our common shares.

Because we did not have any current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended June 27, 2003,
distributions on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital rather than dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and
profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes in future years. To the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes, distributions on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital
distribution and will be treated as dividend income.

Furthermore, we currently believe that we are a foreign personal holding company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under recent U.S. federal income tax legislation, U.S. shareholders who are individuals will not be eligible for reduced
rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income (currently a maximum rate of 15%) on distributions on our common shares if we qualify as a foreign personal holding company in the year in which such distributions were made or in the preceding
taxable year. As a result, if distributions on our common shares are treated as dividend income because we have current or accumulated earnings and profits in the taxable year in which such distributions are made, U.S. shareholders who are
individuals may not qualify for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment under the new legislation.


Potential Governmental Action—Governmental action against companies located in offshore
jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares.

Recently, several state and other governmental officials have threatened to take legislative and other actions against U.S. companies that have expatriated to specific foreign jurisdictions. For example, the
California state treasurer has requested that certain pension funds eliminate from their investment portfolios all public equity and fixed income holdings of companies that have reincorporated in foreign jurisdictions. If we are included within the
scope of such legislation or governmental action, it may reduce the demand for, and have a material adverse effect on the price of, our common shares.

Securities Litigation—Significant fluctuations in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against
us.

Significant price and value fluctuations have
occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of rigid disc drive companies and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, following periods of decline in the market
price of a company’s securities, class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and
resources, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Limited Protection of Shareholder Interests—Holders of the common shares may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are
incorporated under Cayman Islands law.

Our corporate
affairs are governed by our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, by the Companies Law (2003 Revision) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our
directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the United States. Therefore, you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions
by our management, directors or controlling shareholder than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, due to the comparatively less developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this area.

Unlike many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not
specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company. This may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the
offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient.

Shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and
accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company. Our directors have discretion under our articles of association to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders,
but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in
connection with a proxy contest.

Subject to limited
exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors. Our Cayman Islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a Cayman
Islands court.

Anti-Takeover Provisions Could Discourage
or Prevent an Acquisition of Us—Provisions of our articles of association and Cayman Islands corporate law may impede a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of the common shares.

Our articles of association permit our board of directors to issue preferred
shares from time to time, with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate. Our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of
discouraging a takeover or other transaction.


Unlike many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not provide for mergers as that
expression is understood under corporate law in the United States. While Cayman Islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, which are commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a
“scheme of arrangement,” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the United States.
Under Cayman Islands law and practice, a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent Cayman Islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting
(either in person or by proxy) at such meeting. The shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75% of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders (excluding the shares owned by the parties to the
scheme of arrangement) present and voting at the meeting. The convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation must also be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. Although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the
creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement, the Grand Court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not
otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the Grand Court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that:

•

the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with;

•

the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;

•

the scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve; and

•

the scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law.

Enforcement of Civil Liabilities—Holders of our common shares may
have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands.

Because we are a Cayman Islands exempted company, there is uncertainty as to whether the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands would recognize or enforce
judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman Islands against us
predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.


ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio, or to hedge debt.

We invest in high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of
credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our policy, we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.

We mitigate default risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio and by
investing in only high quality securities. We constantly monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository. We maintain a highly
liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets.

We have both fixed and floating rate debt obligations. We enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures
and working capital needs. We have used derivative financial instruments in the form of an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt obligations. For example, in December 2000, we entered into a fixed rate interest
rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $245 million and an interest rate of 5.40% for a term of two years. The maturity date of the swap matched the principal serial maturities on the underlying debt. Credit exposure resulting from the
derivative financial instruments was diversified among various commercial banking institutions in the United States and Europe. The interest rate swap agreement matured in November 2002.

The table below presents principal (or notional) amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for
our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of June 27, 2003. All investments mature in three years or less.

Foreign Currency
Risk.

We transact business in various foreign countries. Our primary foreign currency cash flows are in emerging market countries in Asia and in European countries. During fiscal year 2003, we did not hedge any of our local currency cash flows.
All foreign currency cash flow requirements were met using spot foreign exchange transactions.

SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

—In August 2000, Seagate Technology, which was then known as Seagate Technology Holdings and is referred to herein as
“the Company,” was formed to be a holding company for the rigid disc drive operating business and the storage area networks operating business of Seagate Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which is referred to herein as
“Seagate Delaware.” Prior to November 22, 2000, Seagate Technology did not have significant operations. As a result, the predecessor to Seagate Technology, the Seagate Technology Hard Disc Drive Business, an operating business of Seagate
Delaware (“Predecessor”), is the combined rigid disc drive and storage area networks operating businesses of Seagate Delaware, and the combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Predecessor are presented in
these financial statements on a comparative basis. Throughout these financial statements we make reference to the “Company” to refer to both Seagate Technology and its Predecessor.

On November 22, 2000, the predecessor to the Company’s parent, Seagate
Delaware, Seagate Software Holdings, Inc., which we refer to herein as Seagate Software Holdings, a subsidiary of Seagate Delaware, and Suez Acquisition Company (Cayman) Limited, which we refer to herein as SAC, completed a stock purchase agreement
and Seagate Delaware and VERITAS Software Corporation, which we refer to as VERITAS, completed an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization, which we refer to as the Merger Agreement. SAC was an exempted company incorporated with limited
liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and formed solely for the purpose of entering into the stock purchase agreement and related acquisitions. SAC assigned all of its rights under the stock purchase agreement to New SAC, the parent of the
Company. In addition, the rigid disc drive operating business was formed as a subsidiary of the Company, and was named Seagate Technology HDD Holdings and the storage area networks business was formed also as a subsidiary of the Company and was
named Seagate Technology SAN Holdings.

On November 4, 2002,
the Company sold XIOtech Corporation, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary that operated the Company’s storage area networks operating business, to New SAC. At the time XIOtech was sold, New SAC, the Company’s parent, owned over 99% of the
Company. See Note 12, Sale of XIOtech Corporation. On December 13, 2002, the Company completed the initial public offering of 72,500,000 of its common shares, 24,000,000 of which were sold by the Company and 48,500,000 of which were sold by New SAC,
as selling shareholder, at a price of $12 per share. Immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering, the Company’s then-outstanding 400 million preferred shares owned by New SAC were converted into common shares on a one-to-one
basis. The Company’s common shares began trading on December 11, 2002. As of June 27, 2003, New SAC owned 351.5 million common shares of the Company, or approximately 80.1% of total outstanding common shares. Additionally, on December 13, 2002,
the Company changed its corporate name from “Seagate Technology Holdings” to “Seagate Technology.”

In July 2003, the Company completed the secondary public offering of 69,000,000 of its common shares, all of which were sold by New SAC, as selling
shareholder, at a price of $18.75 per share. See Note 17. Subsequent Events—Consummation of Secondary Public Offering.

The Company designs, manufactures and markets products for storage, retrieval and management of data on computer and data communications systems. The
Company sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) for inclusion in their computer systems or subsystems, and to distributors who typically sell to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and other resellers.

Basis of Presentation—

These financial statements
have been prepared using the historical basis of accounting and are presented as if the Company existed separate from New SAC and Seagate Delaware during the periods presented. These financial statements include the historical assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses that are directly related to the Company’s operations. For certain assets and liabilities that are not specifically identifiable with the Company, estimates have been used to allocate such assets and liabilities to the
Company by applying methodologies management believes are appropriate.

The statements of operations include all revenues and expenses attributable to the Company, including allocations of certain corporate administration, finance, and management costs. Such costs were proportionately allocated to the Company
based on detailed inquiries and estimates of time incurred by corporate marketing and general administrative departmental managers. In addition, certain of the Company’s operations are shared locations involving activities that pertain to the
Company as well as to other businesses of New SAC and its Predecessor, Seagate Delaware. Costs incurred in shared locations are allocated based on specific identification, or where specific identification is not possible, such costs are allocated
between the Company and other businesses of New SAC and its Predecessor, Seagate Delaware based on the volume of activity, head count, square footage, and other methodologies that management believes are reasonable. Transactions and balances between
entities and locations within the Company have been eliminated. Management believes that the foregoing allocations were made on a reasonable basis.

Certain non-operating assets and related non-operating income and expense are included in the historical results of the Company but are not part of
continuing assets of the Company subsequent to the November 2000 transactions.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

—The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates.

The Company establishes
certain distributor and original equipment manufacturer sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. These programs are typically related to a distributor’s level of sales, order size, advertising or point of sale activity or an
OEM’s level of sale activity or agreed upon rebate programs. The Company provides for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements. These estimates are based on various factors, including estimated
future price erosion, distributor sell-through levels, program participation and customer claim submittals. Significant variations in any of these factors could have a material effect on the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s warranty provision considers estimated product failure
rates, trends and estimated repair or replacement costs. The Company uses a statistical model to help the Company with its estimates and the Company exercises considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates. Should actual experience in
any future period differ significantly from its estimates, or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past, the Company’s future results of operations could be materially affected. The actual
results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company if the actual rate of unit failure or the cost to repair a unit is greater than that which the Company has used in estimating the warranty expense
accrual.

The Company’s recording of deferred tax assets
each period depends primarily on the Company’s ability to generate current and future taxable income in the United States. Each period the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets and adjusts the
valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.

The Company also has other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts and
valuation of inventory. The Company believes that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective, or it is less likely that
they would have a material impact on its reported results of operations for a given period.

Basis of Consolidation

—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned subsidiaries, after eliminations of intercompany transactions and balances.

The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal
year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30. Accordingly, fiscal year 2001 comprised 52 weeks for the combined Company and Predecessor and ended on June 29, 2001. Fiscal years 2002 and 2003 both comprised 52 weeks and ended on
June 28, 2002 and June 27, 2003, respectively. All references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2004 will be 53 weeks and will end on July 2, 2004.

Reclassifications

—In fiscal year 2001, certain costs aggregating
$10 million for the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and $72 million for the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000, associated with: (1) searching for or evaluating product or process alternatives: (2) modifying the formulation
or design of products or processes; and (3) activities required to advance the design of products that were previously classified by the Predecessor in cost of revenue were reclassified to product development.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation

—The U.S. dollar is
the functional currency for most of the Company’s foreign operations. Gains and losses on the remeasurement into U.S. dollars of amounts denominated in foreign currencies are included in net income (loss) for those operations whose functional
currency is the U.S. dollar and translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income (loss) and as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ equity (business equity for the Predecessor),
for those operations whose functional currency is the local currency.

Derivative Financial Instruments

—The Company applies the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”). The standard requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships.

Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances, and Sales Incentive Programs

—The
Company’s revenue recognition policy complies with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” Revenue from sales of products is generally recognized upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, including a fixed price to the buyer, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Estimated product returns are provided in accordance with SFAS No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists” and were not
material for any period. The Company’s distribution customers are on a sell-in model, under which revenue is recognized when products are sold to distributors.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company’s North American distribution customers transitioned from a
consignment model, under which the Company recognized revenue when distributors sold the Company’s products to their customers, to a sell-in model, under which the Company recognizes revenue when its products are sold to distributors. During
fiscal year 2002, this transition resulted in a one-time increase in total revenue, operating income and net income of approximately 1%, 3% and 7%, respectively. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2002, this transition resulted in a one-time
increase in total revenue, operating income and net income of approximately 4%, 9% and 9%, respectively.

Estimated reductions to revenue for sales incentive programs, such as price protection, and sales growth bonuses, are recorded when revenue is recorded.
Marketing development programs, when granted, are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense depending on the contractual nature of the program and whether the conditions of EITF 00-25, “Vendor Income
Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,” have been met.

Product Warranty

—Enterprise products that are used in large scale servers and data warehousing systems are warranted for three to five years
while personal storage products used in consumer and commercial desktop systems are warranted for one to three years. A provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is recorded when revenue is recorded and is included in cost of
revenue. The Company offers extended warranties on certain of its products. Deferred revenue in relation to extended warranties has not been material to date. Shipping and handling costs are also included in cost of revenue.

Inventory

—Inventories are valued at the lower of standard cost
(which approximates actual cost using the first-in, first-out method) or market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated cost of completion and disposal.

Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements

—Land, equipment,
buildings and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Equipment and buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease.

Advertising Expense

—The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $28 million and $29 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $30 million and $15
million for the periods from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion (“APBO”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APBO 25”), and related interpretations.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

—In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved. The adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). The Interpretation will significantly change current practice in
the accounting for, and disclosure of, guarantees. The Interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value, which is different from prior practice, which is generally recorded a liability only when a loss was probable and
reasonably estimable, as those terms are defined in FASB Statement No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”. The Interpretation also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments
under the guarantee is remote, which is another change from current practice. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 in the quarter ended December 27, 2002. See Note 14. Guarantees. The Company adopted the initial recognition and
measurement provisions of FIN 45 prospectively in the quarter ended March 28, 2003. The implementation did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”). SFAS 148 amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS 123’s fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require disclosure in the summary of significant
accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. While SFAS 148 does not amend SFAS
123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method, the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are applicable to all companies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether they account for that
compensation using the fair value method of SFAS 123 or the intrinsic value method of APBO 25. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 in the quarter ended March 28, 2003 and will continue to use the intrinsic value method
described in APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“ABPO 25”), in accounting for the fair value of stock awards issued to employees.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No.
51” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest
or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31,
2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not believe that the adoption of FIN
46 will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS
149”), which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS 133. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 except for the provisions that were cleared by the FASB in prior pronouncements. The Company does not expect the provision of this statement to have a significant impact on its results of operations or
financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity”. This statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In accordance with the standard, financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities. This statement shall be effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise shall be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2004. The Company does not expect the provision of this statement to have a significant impact on
the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

—The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at
cost, which approximates fair value. The Company’s short-term investments are primarily comprised of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase. The Company has classified its
entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are classified as cash equivalents or short-term investments and are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive
income, which is a component of shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income.
Realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Strategic Investments

—The Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives and
typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks on these investments. Both marketable and non-marketable investments are included in other assets. A substantial majority of the Company’s marketable investments are
classified as available-for-sale as of the balance sheet date and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in shareholder’s equity. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method. Realized gains or losses and declines in value, if any, judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are reported in other income or expense. Non-marketable investments are recorded at cost. The Company’s results
of operations for the year ended June 27, 2003 included a write-down of $10 million in an investment in a private company.


SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)

Concentration of Credit Risk

—The Company’s customer base for disc drive products is
concentrated with a small number of systems manufacturers and distributors. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily accounts receivable, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The allowance for noncollection of accounts receivable is based upon the expected
collectibility of all accounts receivable. The Company places its cash equivalents and short-term investments in investment-grade, short-term debt instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one commercial issuer.

Supplier Concentration

—Certain of the raw materials used by the
Company in the manufacture of its products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential materials due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry.

For example, all of the Company’s disc drive products require ASIC
chips, which are produced by a limited number of manufacturers. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 and the first half of fiscal year 2001, the Company experienced shortages and delays with regard to receipt of such chips. If the Company
were unable to procure certain of such materials, it would be required to reduce its manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations.

Net Income Per Share

On November 22, 2000, New SAC contributed the hard disc drive business to the Company in exchange for all the then-outstanding capital stock, which
comprised of 400 million shares of Seagate Technology’s Series A preferred shares. Each Series A preferred share owned by New SAC was convertible into a common share on a one-to-one basis, was entitled to receive dividends and distributions
ratably with holders of the common shares, and had voting rights on an as if converted to common shares basis. For the purpose of computing basic and diluted net income per share, in periods when the Company has net income, the Series A preferred
shares have been included in the denominator because, other than their preference in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the Series A preferred shares were effectively the same as common shares.

Prior to the stock purchase agreement executed by Suez Acquisition Company,
the Predecessor had no outstanding share capital. Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is not presented because the Predecessor had no formal capital structure. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the period from November 23, 2000 to
June 29, 2001 is not presented because Seagate Technology had a net loss and had no outstanding common shares. The potential common shares represented by the assumed conversion of the Series A preferred shares into common shares would be
antidilutive for the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001.

In accordance with SFAS 128, “Earnings per Share,” the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 (in millions, except per share
data):

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and
Disclosure.” SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123 to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS 123’s fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 and APB
Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net
income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. While SFAS 148 does not amend SFAS 123 or APBO 25 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method, the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148
are applicable to all companies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of SFAS 123 or the intrinsic value method of APBO 25.

The Company continues to use the intrinsic value method under ABPO 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting method provided under SFAS 123 requires the use of option valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model used by the
Company, that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of trade options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s stock-based awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
stock-based awards. The pro forma information under SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, is as follows:

No tax effects were included in the
determination of pro forma net income because the deferred tax asset resulting from stock-based employee compensation would be offset by an additional valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The effects on pro forma disclosures of applying SFAS
123 may not be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures in future periods because the Company only began granting options to employees in July 2001. See Note 3, Compensation—Stock-Based Benefit Plans, for a discussion of the
Company’s assumptions used to estimate stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123.

Fair Value Disclosures

—The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair

The carrying values and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

Derivative
Financial Instruments

—The Company may enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments, certain foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions and
anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. During fiscal years 2003 and 2002, the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and the period from
July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000, the Company did not have any foreign currency forward exchange or purchased currency option contracts.

In December 2000, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its floating rate debt as required under the terms of the
loan agreement. On May 13, 2002, in connection with the repayment of the former senior secured credit facilities, a loss of $4 million under the swap agreement was recognized and included as an element of the debt refinancing charges. The swap
agreement was then redesignated as a hedge for a portion of the floating rate debt under the new senior secured credit facilities. The interest rate swap agreement expired in November 2002. The Company does not enter into swap agreements for trading
purposes.

The Company does transact business in various
foreign countries and its primary foreign currency cash flows are in emerging market countries in Asia and in some European countries. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in the determination of net income (loss) were a gain
of $1 million for fiscal year 2003, a loss of $8 million for fiscal year 2002, and gains of $3 million and $1 million for the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000, respectively.

Uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries.

Inventories

Inventories are summarized below:

Property, equipment and leasehold
improvements

Property, equipment and leasehold
improvements consisted of the following:

Equipment and
leasehold improvements include assets under capitalized leases. Amortization of leasehold improvements is included in depreciation expense. Depreciation expense was $390 million, $320 million, $164 million and $238 million for fiscal years 2003 and
2002 and the periods from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000, respectively.

Intangibles

Other intangible assets consist of trademarks, assembled workforces, distribution networks, developed technology, and customer bases related to
acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method. Amortization of purchased intangibles, other than acquired developed technology, is provided on a straight-line basis over the respective useful lives of the assets ranging from 36 to 60 months for
trademarks, 24 to 60 months for assembled workforces and distribution networks, and 12 to 48 months for customer bases. In-process research and development without alternative future use is expensed when acquired.


SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)

In fiscal year 2002 and prior periods, in accordance with SFAS 121, the carrying value of other
intangibles and related goodwill was reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that they might be permanently impaired. If the review indicated these assets’ carrying value was not recoverable, as determined based on the undiscounted net
cash flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization period, the Company’s carrying value was reduced to its estimated fair value, first by reducing goodwill, and second by reducing long-term assets and other intangibles (generally
based on an estimate of discounted future net cash flows). Goodwill and other intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from two to fifteen years. Accumulated amortization of intangibles was $3 million, $1
million, and $17 million at June 27, 2003, June 28, 2002 and June 29, 2001, respectively.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company reduced its valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recorded in connection with the November 2000 transactions to reflect the realization of acquired tax
benefits in the Company’s income tax returns. As a result of the application of SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” $104 million of the reduction in valuation allowance resulted in an increase to the amount of unamortized
negative goodwill and was allocated on a pro rata basis to reduce the purchase price of all remaining long-lived intangible assets acquired in the November 2000 transactions. As a result, the carrying value of all remaining intangible assets that
were acquired in the November 2000 transactions was reduced from $104 million to zero.

Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities

On May
13, 2002, the Company and its subsidiaries completed a refinancing of all its outstanding debt obligations. The refinancing was completed when the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings (“HDD”) and
Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc., entered into new senior secured credit facilities with a group of banks that permit up to $500 million of borrowings consisting of a $150 million revolving credit and a five-year $350 million, LIBOR + 2% term
loan facility that was drawn in full as part of the refinancing. At the same time, HDD issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 8% senior notes due 2009. In addition, Seagate Technology International (“STI”), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of HDD, initiated a tender offer to purchase its outstanding 12


/


% senior subordinated notes due
2007. On May 13, 2002, all of the 12


/


% senior subordinated notes were paid. In addition, on May 13, 2002, STI
and Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. repaid the remaining balance outstanding of $679 million, including accrued interest, on its Term A and Term B bank loans.

Neither the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities nor the indenture governing the outstanding
8% senior notes due 2009 impose any restrictions on the ability of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds to HDD, a co-borrower under the new senior secured credit facilities and the issuer of the outstanding notes, in the
form of dividends, loans or advances. The new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a first priority pledge of substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of HDD and many of its subsidiaries. In addition, Seagate Technology and
many of its direct and indirect subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations under the new senior secured credit facilities.

As a result of the refinancing, $93 million was charged to operations in the quarter ended June 28, 2002. The $93 million charge was comprised of a $50
million redemption premium on the 12


/


% senior subordinated notes, $31 million write-off of capitalized debt
issue costs related to the prior senior debt obligations (Term A and Term B loans) and the 12

At June 27, 2003, future minimum principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations

As of June 27, 2003,
the Company had $31 million of outstanding standby letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees issued under the $150 million revolving credit facility that was established at the time of the May 13, 2002 refinancing.

The Company is restricted in its ability to pay distributions to its
shareholders by the covenants contained in the indenture governing its senior notes and the credit agreement governing its senior secured credit facilities. The covenants contained in the indenture governing the Company’s senior notes limit the
aggregate amount of restricted payments, including distributions to shareholders. Currently, the most significant restriction on the Company’s ability to pay dividends is under the credit agreement governing the Company’s senior secured
credit facilities which limits annual distributions to $80 million. The Company’s declaration of distributions is also subject to Cayman Islands law and the discretion of its board of directors.

3. Compensation

Tax-Deferred Savings Plan

The Company has a tax-deferred savings plan, the Seagate 401(k) Plan (“the 40l(k) plan”), for the benefit of qualified employees. The 40l(k)
plan is designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds at retirement. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the 401(k) plan on a monthly basis. The Company may make annual contributions at the discretion of its board of
directors. During fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001, the Company made contributions of $15 million, $13 million and $9 million, respectively. For the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000,
Seagate Delaware made contributions of $5 million.

Stock-Based Benefit
Plans

Share Option Plan

—Options granted under
the Seagate Technology 2001 Share Option Plan (the “Seagate Technology Option Plan”) were granted at fair market value and expire ten years from the date of grant. The following is a summary of stock option activity for the Seagate
Technology Option Plan:

Options exercisable at
the end of fiscal year 2003 were approximately 26,545,585 at a weighted average exercise price of $2.49. Options exercisable at the end of fiscal year 2002 were approximately 23,154,473 at a weighted average exercise price of $2.30.

Employees of the Company were eligible to participate in Seagate
Delaware’s stock option plans. Options granted under Seagate Delaware’s stock option plans were granted at fair market value, expired ten years from the date of the grant and generally vested in four equal annual installments, commencing
one year from the date of the grant. On November 22, 2000, in connection with the VERITAS merger, vesting of Seagate Delaware options were accelerated. Prior to the acceleration, options outstanding as of November 22, 2000 were approximately 23
million.

Executive Stock Plan

—Seagate Delaware had
an Executive Stock Plan under which senior executives of the Company were granted the right to purchase shares of the Seagate Delaware’s common stock at $0.01 per share. The difference between the fair market value of the shares on the
measurement date and the exercise price was recorded as deferred compensation by Seagate Delaware and was charged to operations of the Company over the vesting period of four to seven years. At November 22, 2000, 1,590,000 restricted shares were
outstanding to the employees of the Company.

On November 22,
2000, and in connection with the merger with VERITAS, Seagate Delaware accelerated vesting on 207,000 restricted shares and recorded $3.4 million of compensation expense in connection with the exchange of such shares for merger consideration. All
remaining restricted stock was canceled and holders of such stock were eligible to participate in a deferred cash compensation plan and received ordinary and preferred shares of New SAC.

Deferred Stock Compensation

—In connection with certain stock options granted during the
six-month period ended December 27, 2002, the Company recorded deferred stock compensation totaling $10.7 million, representing the difference between the exercise price of the options and the deemed fair value of the Company’s common shares on
the dates the options were granted. This deferred stock compensation is being amortized over the vesting periods of the underlying stock options of 48 months. Through June 27, 2003, the Company has amortized approximately $2 million of such
compensation expense.

Stock Purchase Plan

—The
Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP plan”) in December 2002. A total of 20,000,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under the ESPP plan, plus an automatic annual increase on the first day of
the Company’s fiscal year beginning in 2003 equal to the lesser of 2,500,000 shares or 0.5% of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or such lesser number of shares as is determined by the
Company’s board of directors. In no event shall the total number of shares issued under the ESPP plan exceed 75,000,000 shares. The ESPP plan permits eligible employees who have completed thirty days of employment prior to the commencement of
any offering period to purchase common stock through payroll deductions generally at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock. The ESPP plan has two six-month purchase periods and contains a “rollover” feature if the market price
of the stock at the end of any six-month purchase period is lower than the stock price at the beginning of the offering period. In that case, the plan is immediately canceled after that purchase date, and a new one-year plan is established using the
then-current stock price as the base purchase price.

Assumptions Used in Determining Pro Forma Information

—See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for pro forma information on net income and earnings per share required under SFAS 123, as
amended by SFAS 148.

As a result of the November 2000
transactions, all stock options other than stock options included in the management rollover, were accelerated and exercised. The full fair value of these stock options amounting to $567 million was recorded as compensation in the period from July
1, 2000 to November 22, 2000. Of the $567 million, $265 million was allocated to cost of revenue, $116 million was allocated to product development expense, and $185 million was allocated to marketing and administrative expense. In these
circumstances and because of the significant change in the Company’s ownership and equity structure, the Company believes the pro forma net income (loss) information, for the period from July 1, 2000 to November 2000, as required by SFAS 123 is
not meaningful and such information has not been provided.

Up
to the Company’s initial public offering of its common stock in December 2002, the fair value of the Company’s stock options was estimated using the minimum value method. For all employee stock options issued in fiscal year 2003 subsequent
to December 11, 2002, the first trading day of the Company’s stock, the Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued to employees using the Black-Scholes valuation method with a volatility factor using estimated based on the stock
volatilities of the Company’s publicly traded competitors.

The following table summarizes information about options outstanding at June 27, 2003 (shares in millions).

The fair value of the Company’s stock options granted to employees for fiscal years 2003 and
2002 was estimated assuming no expected dividends (for periods prior to December 27, 2002) and the following weighted average assumptions:

The Company’s
initial public offering of its common shares was completed on December 13, 2002. The weighted average fair value of stock options granted under the Seagate Technology Option plan was $4.80 and $0.95 for fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
weighted average fair value of stock options granted under the ESPP plan was $3.31 for fiscal year 2003.

Deferred Compensation Plan

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions, in excess of the tax limits applicable to the 401(k)
plan and to permit employee deferrals in excess of certain tax limits. Company assets earmarked to pay benefits under the plan are held by a rabbi trust. The Company has adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97-14,
“Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned are Held in a Rabbi Trust” (“EITF 97-14”). Under EITF 97-14, the assets and liabilities of a rabbi trust must be accounted for as if they are assets and
liabilities of the Company. In addition all earnings and expenses of the rabbi trust are recorded in the Company’s financial statements.

Seagate Technology Share Option Plan

In December 2000, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Seagate Technology Share Option Plan (the “Seagate Technology Option Plan”).
Under the terms of the Seagate Technology Option Plan eligible employees, directors, and consultants can be awarded options to purchase common shares of the Company under vesting terms to be determined at the date of grant. In January 2002, the
Seagate Technology Option Plan was amended to increase the maximum number of common shares issuable under the Seagate Technology Option Plan from 72 million to 100 million. No options to purchase the Company’s common shares had been issued
through June 29, 2001. From July 1, 2001 through June 27, 2003, options to purchase 87,954,753 common shares were granted to employees under this share option plan, net of cancellations. Options granted to exempt employees will generally vest as
follows: 25% of the shares will vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% will vest proportionately each month over the next 36 months. Options granted to non-exempt employees will vest on the first
anniversary of the vesting commencement date.

Post-Retirement Health Care Plan

In fiscal year 2000, Seagate Delaware adopted a post-retirement health care plan that offers medical coverage to eligible
U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents. Substantially all U.S. employees become eligible for these benefits after 15 years of service and attaining age 60 and older.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the post-retirement health care plan’s benefit
obligation and a statement of the funded status as of June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002:

Net periodic benefit
cost for the years ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 was as follows:

Weighted-Average
Actuarial Assumptions:

A discount rate of 6.25% was used
in the determination of the accumulated benefit obligation.

The Company’s future medical benefit costs were estimated to increase at an annual rate of 11% during 2003, decreasing to an annual growth rate of 5% in 2009 and thereafter. The Company’s cost is capped at 200% of the fiscal year
1999 employer cost and, therefore, will not be subject to medical and dental trends after the capped cost is attained. A 1% change in these annual trend rates would not have a significant impact on the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
at June 27, 2003, or the 2003 benefit expense. Claims are paid as incurred.

4. Income Taxes

The U.S. federal and state tax Allocation Agreement (“Tax Allocation Agreement”) between the Predecessor and its U.S. subsidiaries was
terminated on November 22, 2000, and the Company no longer files its federal income tax returns on a consolidated basis with affiliates of New SAC. Therefore, the Company does not benefit from nor does the Company reimburse any affiliates of New SAC
pursuant to the Tax Allocation Agreement for U.S. federal tax losses that may be sustained subsequent to consummation of the November 2000 transactions. In prior periods, the Predecessor had recorded substantial intercompany payables for utilization
of tax losses of its U.S. subsidiaries that have been netted against the Predecessor’s business equity interest in the U.S. subsidiaries.

Certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company are included in certain unitary and combined U.S. state tax returns with certain U.S. affiliates of New SAC and
have entered into a tax sharing agreement effective November 23, 2000. Pursuant to the terms of the state tax sharing agreement (“State Tax Allocation Agreement”), hypothetical U.S. state tax returns (with certain modifications) are
calculated as if the U.S. subsidiaries of the Company were filing on a separate return basis. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are required to reimburse participating New SAC U.S. affiliates to the extent the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries
utilize the tax attributes of these U.S. affiliates of New SAC to reduce their separately computed income tax liabilities within 30 days of the close of the fiscal year such affiliates would have otherwise been able to utilize their own tax
attributes. If New SAC’s participating U.S. affiliates utilize tax attributes of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries, the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries will be reimbursed for those tax attributes within 30 days of the close of the fiscal
year during which the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries would have otherwise been able to utilize the tax attributes to reduce their separately computed tax liabilities. As of June 27, 2003, there were no outstanding balances for taxes due to or from
any New SAC affiliates.

The provision for (benefit from)
income taxes consisted of the following:

Approximately $115
million of U.S. income tax benefits related to the exercise of certain employee stock options decreased accrued income taxes and was credited to additional paid-in capital in the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

In connection with the
purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware, the Company recorded a $434 million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The $434 million of deferred tax assets subject to the valuation allowance arose primarily as a result of the
excess tax basis over the fair values of acquired property, plant and equipment, and liabilities assumed for which the Company expects to receive tax deductions in its U.S. federal and state income tax returns in future periods. The Company also
recorded $63 million of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the excess of the fair market value of inventory and acquired intangible assets over their related tax bases.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company reduced to zero the $104 million net carrying value of long-lived
intangibles recorded in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware in order to reflect tax benefits recognized by the Company in its U.S. income tax returns attributable to acquisition related deferred tax assets in
accordance with SFAS 109. Subsequent reductions in the valuation allowance recorded for deferred tax assets in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware will result in an income tax benefit when, and if, realized in
future periods.

At June 27, 2003, the Company had recorded $74
million of deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the Company generating sufficient U.S. taxable income in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Although realization is not assured, the Company’s
management believes that it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease, when the Company reevaluates the underlying basis for its
estimates of future taxable income.

In fiscal year 2003, the
valuation allowance decreased by $70 million. In fiscal year 2002, the valuation allowance decreased by $20 million. In the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001, the valuation allowance increased by $506 million. In the period from July 1,
2000 to November 22, 2000, the net change in valuation allowance was zero.


SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PREDECESSOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)

Approximately $35 million of the valuation allowance as of June 27, 2003 was attributable to the U.S.
income tax benefits of stock option deductions, the benefit of which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when, and if, realized.

At June 27, 2003, the Company had U.S. and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $269 million and $75 million, respectively, which
will expire at various dates beginning in 2004, if not utilized. At June 27, 2003, the Company had U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $49 million, that will expire at various dates beginning in 2006, if not utilized.

Utilization of the U.S. net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may
be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss
or tax credit carry-forwards before utilization.

The
applicable statutory rate in the Cayman Islands was zero for Seagate Technology for fiscal years ended June 27, 2003, June 28, 2002 and the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001. The applicable statutory rate in the U.S. for the Predecessor
was 35%. For purposes of the reconciliation between the provision for (benefit from) income taxes at the statutory rate and the effective tax rate, a notional U.S. 35% rate is applied for Seagate Technology and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%
is applied for the Predecessor as follows:

A substantial portion
of the Company’s Asia Pacific manufacturing operations in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand operate under various tax holidays, which expire in whole or in part during fiscal years 2004 through 2010. Certain of the tax holidays may be extended
if specific conditions are met. As of June 30, 2003, the Company’s manufacturing operations in China no longer operate under a tax holiday. The net impact of these tax holidays was to increase the Company’s net income by approximately $84
million ($0.18 per share, diluted) in fiscal year 2003, to increase the Company’s net income by approximately $74 million ($0.17 per share, diluted) in fiscal year 2002 and to decrease the loss by approximately $36 million in the period from
November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001.

As a result of the sale of
the operating assets of Seagate Delaware and the ensuing corporate structure, the Company now consists of a foreign parent holding company with various foreign and U.S. subsidiaries. Dividend distributions received from the Company’s U.S.
subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes when, and if, distributed. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the
Cayman Islands or U.S. federal income tax if remitted to the foreign parent holding company.

On July 31, 2001, Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service filed a settlement stipulation
with the United States Tax Court in complete settlement of the remaining disputed tax matter reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated June 12, 1998. The settlement stipulation is expressly contingent upon Seagate Delaware and the
Internal Revenue Service entering into a closing agreement in connection with certain tax matters arising in all or some part of the open tax years of Seagate Delaware and New SAC. The settlement remains before the Joint Committee on Taxation for
review. The parties are in the process of incorporating comments from the Joint Committee on Taxation into the parties’ settlement agreements. The settlement and the anticipated execution of the closing agreement(s) will not result in an
additional provision for income taxes.

As of June 27, 2003,
accrued income taxes include $125 million for tax indemnification amounts due to VERITAS Software Corporation pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement between Seagate Delaware, Suez Acquisition Company and VERITAS Software Corporation. The tax
indemnification amount was recorded by the Company in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware and represents U.S. tax liabilities previously accrued by Seagate Delaware for periods prior to the acquisition date of
the operating assets. Certain of Seagate Delaware’s federal and state tax returns are under examination by tax authorities. The Company believes that the $125 million tax indemnification amount is adequate to cover any final assessments that
may result from these examinations. The timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain. To the extent the settlement of these examinations results in tax liabilities that are less than the $125 million indemnification amount, the
difference will be recorded as an income tax benefit and may significantly affect the Company’s effective tax rate for the period in which the settlement occurs.

Certain of the Company’s foreign tax returns for various fiscal years are under examination by tax authorities. The
Company believes that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessment that may result from these examinations.

6. Restructuring Costs

During fiscal year 2003, the Company recorded $19 million in restructuring charges. The Company also reduced a restructuring
accrual previously recorded by its predecessor in fiscal year 1998 by $10 million due to a change in estimated lease obligations. These combined actions resulted in a net restructuring charge of $9 million for fiscal year 2003.

Of the $19 million, $17 million was incurred in the quarter ended September
27, 2002 as a result of a restructuring plan, which the Company refers to as the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan, established to continue the alignment of the Company’s global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and
anticipated future market requirements, primarily in its Far East operations. The restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a reduction in its workforce of approximately 3,750 employees, 3,410 of whom had been
terminated as of June 27, 2003. The fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan was substantially complete at June 27, 2003.

The remaining $2 million restructuring charge was incurred in the quarter ended June 27, 2003 and was comprised of employee termination costs relating to
a workforce reduction of approximately 686 employees in the Company’s Thailand operations. These restructuring activities were completed in July 2003.

During fiscal year 2002, the Company recorded $13 million in restructuring charges and reversed $9 million of restructuring charges recorded in prior
fiscal years resulting in a net restructuring charge of $4 million. The restructuring plan implemented in fiscal year 2002 (the “fiscal year 2002 restructuring plan”) was established to align the Company’s global workforce and
manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements, primarily in its IT operations and in its Far East operations in China. The restructuring charges were comprised of $10 million for employee termination costs, $2
million for contract cancellations and $1 million for the write-off of excess manufacturing equipment. The fiscal year 2002 restructuring plan was substantially complete prior to the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2003.

As part of the November 2000 transactions, the Company assumed all
restructuring liabilities previously recorded by Seagate Delaware relating to the Predecessor, including $41 million related to restructuring activities announced in fiscal year 2000 and $3 million related to restructuring activities announced in
fiscal year 2001. During the year ended June 29, 2001, the Company recorded restructuring charges totaling $107 million. Of the $107 million, $98 million was a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of the
Company’s global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements, primarily in its Far East operations in Thailand and Malaysia (the “fiscal 2001 restructuring plan”). The remaining $9
million consisted of a $3 million employee termination benefit adjustment to the original estimate related to the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan and $6 million in additional restructuring charges for adjustments to original lease termination cost
estimates to the fiscal year 1998 restructuring plan. The fiscal 2001 restructuring plan includes workforce reductions, capacity reductions including closure of facilities or portions of facilities, write-off of excess equipment and consolidation of
operations. The restructuring charges were comprised of $59 million for employee termination costs; $22 million for the write-off of owned facilities located in Thailand and Malaysia; $13 million for the write-off of excess manufacturing, assembly
and test equipment; $3 million in lease termination costs; and $1 million in other expenses. Prior to these restructuring activities, there was no indication of permanent impairment of the assets associated with the closure and consolidation of
facilities.

In June 2001, the Company reversed $22 million of
its restructuring accruals comprised of $11 million of restructuring reserves recorded in the current fiscal year and $11 million of restructuring reserves recorded in prior fiscal years. This reversal included $13 million of valuation reserves
classified elsewhere on the balance sheet. In addition, reclassifications between cost categories within the restructuring reserve were made as a result of differences between original estimates and amounts actually incurred or expected to be
incurred.

In connection with the fiscal year 2001
restructuring plan, the Company’s planned workforce reduction and other restructuring activities were substantially complete as of March 29, 2002.

Prior to the Company’s sale of XIOtech Corporation to New SAC on November 4, 2002, the Company had two operating
segments: rigid disc drives and storage area networks, however, only the rigid disc drive business was a reportable segment. See Note 12, Sale of XIOtech Corporation. The operating results for XIOtech are included in the Company’s consolidated
results of operations through the date that XIOtech was sold to New SAC and are included in the “other” category below. The Company has identified its Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, as the Chief Operating Decision Maker. Gross profit
from operations is defined as revenue less cost of revenue.

In
fiscal year 2003, Hewlett-Packard Corporation accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue for a total of $1.143 billion. In fiscal year 2002, on a combined basis Compaq Computer Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Corporation (Hewlett-Packard
Corporation acquired Compaq Computer Corporation in May 2002) accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue for a total of $1.190 billion. For the period from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001, Compaq Computer Corporation and EMC Corporation
each accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue for a total of $527 million and $434 million, respectively. For the period from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000, Compaq Computer Corporation and EMC Corporation each accounted for more than
10% of combined revenue for a total of $422 million and $328 million, respectively.

Long-lived assets consist of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, capital leases, equity investments, goodwill and other intangibles, and other non-current assets as recorded by the Company’s

8. Purchase Accounting

On November 22, 2000, under the stock purchase agreement, the Company’s parent, New SAC completed the purchase of substantially all of the operating
assets of, and assumption of the operating liabilities of, Seagate Delaware and its consolidated subsidiaries. The total net purchase price paid by New SAC for all the businesses of Seagate Delaware, including Seagate Technology, was $1.840 billion
in cash, including transaction costs of approximately $25 million. Immediately thereafter, in a separate and independent transaction, Seagate Delaware and VERITAS completed their merger under the Merger Agreement. At the time of the merger, Seagate
Delaware’s assets included a specified amount of cash, an investment in VERITAS, and certain specified investments and liabilities. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Seagate Delaware, VERITAS and New SAC entered into an Indemnification
Agreement, pursuant to which these entities and certain other subsidiaries of Seagate Delaware agreed to certain indemnification provisions regarding tax and other matters that may arise in connection with the stock purchase agreement and Merger
Agreement.

New SAC accounted for this transaction as a
purchase in accordance with Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 16, “Business Combinations.” All acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets as well as assumed liabilities were valued based on their relative fair
values and reorganized into the following businesses: (1) the rigid disc drive business, which is now the Company, which included the storage area networks business, (2) the removable storage solutions business, which is now Certance Holdings, a
direct subsidiary of New SAC and an affiliate of the Company, (3) the software business, which is now Crystal Decisions, an indirect subsidiary of New SAC and an affiliate of the Company, and (4) an investment holding company, which is now STIH, a
direct subsidiary of New SAC and an affiliate of the Company. Each of Certance Holdings, Crystal Decisions and STIH are direct or indirect subsidiaries of New SAC and are not owned by the Company. The fair value of the net assets exceeded the net
purchase price by approximately $909 million. Accordingly, the resultant negative goodwill was allocated on a pro rata basis to acquired long-lived assets of New SAC, primarily property, plant and equipment, and identified intangible assets, and
reduced the recorded fair value amounts by approximately 46% for all the acquired businesses. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 73, “Push Down Basis of Accounting”, the Company has reflected its parent company’s basis
in the rigid disc drive and storage area networks operating businesses in the related balance sheet at the date of acquisition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(CONTINUED)

The table below summarizes the allocation of net purchase price as it relates to the Company (in
millions).

(1)

Acquired current assets included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets. The fair values of current assets generally approximated the
recorded historic book values. Short-term investments were valued based on quoted market prices. Inventory values were estimated based on the current market value of the inventories less completion costs and less a profit margin for activities
remaining to be completed until the inventory is sold. Valuation allowances were established for current deferred tax assets in excess of long-term deferred tax liabilities (See Note 4, Income Taxes).

Assumed current liabilities included accounts payable, accrued compensation and expenses and accrued income taxes. The fair values of current liabilities
generally approximated the historic recorded book values because of the monetary nature of most of the liabilities.

Details of the net current assets are as follows (in millions):

(2)

The Company, through its parent, estimated the value of the acquired property, plant and equipment, after considering the estimated cost to construct or acquire comparable property.
In making this estimate, machinery and equipment were valued using replacement cost estimates reduced by depreciation factors representing the condition, functionality and operability of the assets. In valuing office and data communication
equipment, the sales comparison approach was used. Land, land improvements, buildings, and building and leasehold improvements were valued based upon discussions with knowledgeable personnel.

(3)

Long-term deferred tax liabilities arose as a result of the excess of the fair values of inventory and acquired intangible assets over their related tax basis. The Company had $434
million of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance was established.

(4)

The Company estimated the value of acquired identified intangibles. The significant assumptions relating to each category are discussed in the following paragraphs. Also, these
assets are being amortized on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful life and resultant amortization is included in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles.

Trade names

—The value of the trade names was based upon discounting to their net present
value the licensing income that would arise by charging the operating businesses that use the trade names.

Developed technologies

—The value of this asset for each operating business was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows
attributable to all existing technologies which had reached technological feasibility, after considering risks relating to: (1) the characteristics and applications of the technology, (2) existing and future markets, and (3) life cycles of the
technologies. Estimates of future revenues and expenses used to determine the value of developed technology were consistent with the historical trends in the industry and expected outlooks.

Assembled workforces

—The value of the assembled work force was
determined by estimating the recruiting, hiring and training costs to replace each group of existing employees.

In-process research and development

—The value of in-process research and development was based on an evaluation of all developmental projects
using the guidance set forth in FIN 4 and SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.” The amount was determined by: (1) obtaining management estimates of future revenues and
operating profits associated with existing developmental projects, (2) projecting the cash flows and costs to completion of the underlying technologies and resultant products, and (3) discounting these cash flows to their net present value.

Estimates of future revenues and expenses used to determine
the value of in-process research and development were consistent with the historical trends in the industry and expected outlooks. The entire amount was charged to operations because related technologies had not reached technological feasibility,
and they had no alternative future use.

9. Equity

Share Capital

The Company’s authorized share capital is $13,500 and consists of 1,250,000,000 common shares, par value $0.00001, of
which 438,870,267 shares were outstanding as of June 27, 2003 and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00001, of which none were issued or outstanding as of June 27, 2003.

Common shares

—Holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends and distributions when and as declared
by the Company’s Board of Directors. Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after required payments are made to holders of preferred shares, any remaining assets of the Company will be distributed ratably to holders of
the preferred and common shares. Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which the common shares are entitled to vote, including the election of directors.

Preferred shares

—The Company is authorized to issue up to a total
of 100 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, without stockholder approval. The Board of Directors is authorized to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the rights, preferences
and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. The Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that
series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred
stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company and might harm the market
price of its common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. As of June 27, 2003, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

In connection with the Company’s initial public offering in December 2002, all previously outstanding shares of
preferred stock aggregating 400 million shares were converted by New SAC into the Company’s common stock. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the previously outstanding preferred shares
were entitled to receive, out of any remaining legally available assets of the Company, a liquidation preference of $2.30 per share, less the aggregate amount of any distributions or dividends already made per preferred share. After the payment in
full of the liquidation preference the holders of preferred shares were entitled to share, ratably with the holders of common shares, in any remaining assets available for distribution. To the extent there were not sufficient remaining assets of the
Company to pay the liquidation preference, holders of preferred shares would share ratably in the distribution of the Company’s remaining assets. Upon payment of the liquidation preference and any other amounts payable on liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, on each preferred share, the preferred shares would be cancelled. During fiscal year 2002, holders of the preferred shares received approximately $199 million, or $0.50 per share, in distributions, which had the effect of
reducing the liquidation preference to approximately $1.80 per share.

Distributions

During fiscal year 2003, the Company made distributions to its shareholders totaling $288 million consisting of a $262 million distribution immediately
prior to the Company’s initial public offering in December 2002, and pursuant to the Company’s quarterly dividend policy, approximately $13 million in distributions in each of February 2003 and May 2003. During fiscal year 2002, the
Company made distributions to its shareholders totaling $200 million consisting of a $33 million distribution in March 2002 and a $167 million distribution in May 2002.

On July 14, 2003, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.04 per share to be paid on or before August
22, 2003 to our shareholders of record as of August 8, 2003.

10.
Commitments

Leases

—The Company leases certain
property, facilities and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements. Land and facility leases expire at various dates through 2027 and contain various provisions for rental adjustments including, in certain cases, a provision based on increases
in the Consumer Price Index. All of the leases require the Company to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs.

Future minimum lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more were as follows at June 27, 2003 (lease payments
are shown net of sublease income):

Total rent expense for
all land, facility and equipment operating leases was approximately $24 million, $23 million, $17 million and $11 million for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and for the periods from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and July 1, 2000 to November 22,
2000, respectively. Total sublease rental income for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and for the periods from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000 was $8 million, $8 million, $6 million and $4 million, respectively.
The Company subleases a portion of its facilities that it considers to be in excess of current requirements. Total future lease income to be recognized for the Company’s existing subleases is approximately $21 million.

Capital Expenditures

—The Company’s commitments for
construction of manufacturing facilities and equipment approximated $147 million at June 27, 2003.

11. Legal, Environmental, and Other Contingencies

Intellectual Property Litigation

Convolve, Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(“MIT”) v. Seagate Technology LLC, et al.

Between 1998 and 1999, Convolve, Inc., a small privately held technology consulting firm, engaged in discussions with Seagate Delaware with respect to the potential license of technology that
Convolve claimed to own. During that period, the parties entered into non-disclosure agreements. The Company declined Convolve’s offer of a license in late 1999. On July 13, 2000, Convolve and MIT filed suit against Compaq Computer Corporation
and the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging patent infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and fraud relating to Convolve and MIT’s
Input Shaping

technology. The plaintiffs claim their
technology is incorporated in the Company’s sound barrier technology, which was publicly announced on June 6, 2000. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, $800 million in compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages. The Company
answered the complaint on August 2, 2000, and filed cross-claims for declaratory judgment that two Convolve/MIT patents are invalid and not infringed and that it owns any intellectual property based on the information that the Company disclosed to
Convolve. The court denied plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery, and ordered plaintiffs to identify their trade secrets to defendants before discovery could begin. Convolve served a trade secrets disclosure on August 4, 2000, and the
Company filed a motion challenging the disclosure statement. On May 3, 2001, the court appointed a special master to review the trade secret issues. The special master resigned on June 5, 2001, and the court appointed another special master on July
26, 2001. After a hearing on the Company’s motion challenging the trade secrets disclosure on September 21, 2001, the special master issued a report and recommendation to the court that the trade secret list was insufficient. Convolve revised
the trade secret list, and the court entered an order on January 1, 2002, accepting the special master’s recommendation that this trade secret list was adequate. Discovery is in process on all non-damages issues. On November 6, 2001, the USPTO
issued US Patent No. 6,314,473 to Convolve. Convolve filed an amended complaint on January 16, 2002, alleging defendants’ infringement of this patent and the Company answered and filed counterclaims on February 8, 2002. On July 26, 2002, the
Company filed a Rule 11 motion challenging the adequacy of Convolve’s pre-filing investigation on the first two patents alleged in the complaint and seeking dismissal of Convolve’s claims related to these patents and reimbursement of
attorney’s fees. The hearing on our Rule 11 motion is scheduled for May 23, 2003. Briefing on claims construction issues has been completed and a claims construction (Markman) hearing has been requested. No trial date has been set. The Company
believes that the claims are without merit and it intends to defend against them vigorously. On May 6, 2003, the USPTO issued to Convolve U.S. Patent No. 6,560,658 B2, entitled “Data Storage Device with Quick and Quiet Modes.” Convolve has
indicated that it will seek leave of the court to add this patent to the lawsuit. This latest patent is a continuation of a patent currently in the lawsuit (U.S. Patent No. 6,314,473). We similarly believe any claims that may relate to this
continuation patent would be without merit, regardless of whether such claims were added to the ongoing litigation or asserted against us in a separate lawsuit. Judge John Martin, who was assigned to this case, has announced his retirement from the
federal bench. We have been informed that the case has been assigned to Judge George B. Daniels.

Shao Tong, et al. v. Seagate International/(Wuxi) Co., Ltd.

In July 2002, the Company was sued in the People’s Court of Nanjing City, China by
an individual, Shao Tong, and a private Chinese company, Nanjing Yisike Network Safety Technique Co., Ltd. The complaint alleged that two of the Company’s personal storage rigid disc drive products infringe Chinese patent number ZL94111461.9,
which prevents the corruption of systems data stored on rigid disc drives. The suit, which sought to stop the Company from manufacturing the two products and claimed immaterial monetary damages, was dismissed by the court on procedural grounds on
November 29, 2002. On December 3, 2002, the plaintiffs served the Company with notice that they had refiled the lawsuit. The new complaint contains identical infringement claims against the same disc drive products, claims immaterial monetary
damages and attorney fees and requests injunctive relief and a recall of the products from the Chinese market. Manufacture of the accused products ceased in May 2003. On June 10, 2003, we presented our non-infringement case to the technical panel.
The panel issued a technical advisory report to the court finding no infringement. The court has set a hearing on the technical advisory report for August 21, 2003. The Company believes the claims are without merit, and it intends to defend against
them vigorously.

Seagate Technology v. Read-Rite
Corporation.

In order to clarify the Company’s rights under a patent cross-license agreement that Seagate Delaware entered into with Read-Rite Corporation as of December 31, 1994, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action on May 7,
2003 in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, seeking a declaration that the Company is entitled to a cross-license, effective as of November 22, 2000, under terms substantially identical to those contained in the original Patent
Cross License Agreement. On June 11, 2003, Read-Rite Corporation answered the complaint putting forward a general denial and asserting various affirmative defenses. On June 17, 2003, Read-Rite Corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon notice, the Company’s declaratory judgment action has been stayed. On July 23, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bid of Western Digital Corporation to acquire the assets of Read-Rite
Corporation, including the intellectual property that was the subject of Read-Rite’s dispute with us, in a transaction that closed on July 31, 2003.

Environmental Matters

The Company’s operations inside and outside the United States are subject to laws and regulations relating to
protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and clean-up of contaminated sites. Contaminants have been detected at
some of the Company’s former sites, principally in connection with historical operations. In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites. Investigative activities have taken place at all
sites of known contamination. One former site is under a Consent Order by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The extent of the contamination at this site has been investigated and defined and remediation is underway. The Company is indemnified
by a third party for a portion of the costs it may incur in the clean-up of contamination at most sites. In the opinion of management, including internal counsel, the potential losses to the Company in excess of amounts already accrued arising out
of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or overall trends in results of operations, even if joint and several liabilities were to be assessed and if the third party failed to
indemnify the Company.

Other Matters

The Company is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, management believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position
or results of operations.

12. Sale of XIOtech Corporation

On November 4, 2002, the Company sold XIOtech Corporation, the
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary that operated the Company’s storage area networks business, to New SAC. New SAC in turn sold 51% of XIOtech to a third party in a transaction in which XIOtech sold newly issued shares to this third party. As a
result, New SAC has retained an interest of less than 20% of XIOtech.

In consideration of the Company’s sale of XIOtech to New SAC, the Company received a $32 million promissory note from New SAC. The amount of this promissory note was equal to the estimated fair value of XIOtech as of the date of the
sale, net of intercompany indebtedness. Immediately after the sale of XIOtech to New SAC, the Company made an in-kind pro rata distribution of the entire promissory note to the holders of its then-outstanding shares, including New SAC, which at the
time owned approximately 99.4% of its outstanding shares. That portion of the note distributed back to New SAC was cancelled, and New SAC immediately paid off the remaining 0.6% of the promissory note held by the Company’s minority
shareholders. As a result of the sale of XIOtech, the Company will no longer consolidate XIOtech’s operations with its operations.

Because New SAC at the time owned approximately 99.4% of the Company’s outstanding shares, the Company’s sale of XIOtech to New SAC was recorded
as a dividend of an amount equal to the net book value of XIOtech of $1 million rather than as a sale for the fair value of the promissory note. As of November 4, 2002, XIOtech’s balance sheet consisted of $33 million of current assets, $6
million of non-current assets, $36 million of current liabilities (which included $19 million of intercompany indebtedness), and $2 million of long-term liabilities.

13. Warranty and Services Agreement

On October 28, 2002, the Company closed the sale of its product repair and servicing facility in Reynosa, Mexico and certain related equipment and
inventory to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jabil Circuit, Inc. (“Jabil”). After the sale, Jabil became the Company’s primary source provider of warranty repair services for a multi-year period at costs defined in a long-term services
agreement. During the term of this services agreement, the Company will be dependent upon Jabil to effectively manage warranty repair related costs and activities. The arrangement with Jabil is comprised of various elements, including the sale of
the facility, equipment and inventory, the Company’s obligations under the services agreement, and potential reimbursements by the Company to Jabil. Because the fair values of each of these elements have not been separately established, and
because the Company will repurchase the inventory sold to Jabil, the $10 million excess of the sale prices assigned to various elements of the arrangements with Jabil over their respective carrying values will be offset against cost of revenue as a
reduction to warranty expense. Of the $10 million excess, $5 million was utilized in the quarter ended December 27, 2002 to offset an immediate repair cost increase and the remaining $5 million is being utilized over the remaining period of the
long-term services agreement.

14. Guarantees

Intellectual Property Indemnification Obligations

The Company has entered into agreements with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are
customary in the industry. These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions. The nature of the
intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers and suppliers. Historically, the Company has not made any
significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.

Product Warranty

The Company estimates probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its
products for a period of one to five years. The Company uses estimated repair or replacement costs and uses statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine its warranty obligation. Changes in the Company’s product
warranty liability during the fiscal years ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 were as follows:

The Company offers
extended warranties on certain of its products. Deferred revenue in relation to extended warranties has not been material to date.

15. Related Party Transactions

Affiliate Transactions

Historically, the Company has provided substantial services to other affiliated companies. Upon the closing of the stock purchase agreement by New SAC,
these services continue to be provided by the Company through New SAC. The services provided generally include general management, treasury, tax, financial reporting, benefits administration, insurance, information technology, legal, accounts
payable and receivable and credit functions, among others. The Company charges for these services through corporate expense allocations. The amount of corporate expense allocations depends upon the total amount of allocable costs incurred by the
Company on behalf of the affiliated company less amounts charged as specified cost or expense rather than by allocation. Such costs have been proportionately allocated to the affiliated companies based on detailed inquiries and estimates of time
incurred by the Company’s corporate marketing and general administrative departmental managers. Management believes that the allocations charged to other affiliated companies are reasonable. Allocations charged to other affiliated
companies’ marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and for the periods from November 23, 2000 to June 29, 2001 and from July 1, 2000 to November 22, 2000 were $3.9 million, $4.1 million, $3.5 million and $1.3
million, respectively. Purchases and sales to other affiliated companies were not material for any of the periods presented.

Employee Receivables

At June 27, 2003, amounts receivable from three officers totaled $1.8 million while amounts receivable from an additional 12 officers and/or employees
totaled $1.1 million. At June 28, 2002, amounts receivable from three officers totaled $2.2 million while amounts from an additional 23 officers and/or employees totaled $1.8 million. Individual loans were made to these employees to assist them with
relocation costs and/or beginning employment at the Company. At June 27, 2003, the loans totaling $1.8 million bear interest at 8% per year and are due in lump sum payments, including unpaid interest, in fiscal year 2006. Under the terms of these
loans, $0.7 million of the $1.8 million, as well as accrued and unpaid interest, will be forgiven if these officers remain employed for a specified period of time. In the periods in which these officers fulfill their employment obligations, the
amount of principal and interest, which are forgiven ratably over the required employment term, will be charged to compensation expense. The loans totaling $1.1 million generally are non-interest bearing and are due in lump sum payments at the end
of a five-year period.

Distributions to New SAC

On March 19, 2002, the Company paid a distribution of $33 million to its
shareholders, including New SAC, to enable New SAC to make a distribution of approximately $33 million to its shareholders, which allowed members of the Company’s sponsor group to satisfy tax obligations. Approximately $32 million of this
amount was paid to New SAC. New SAC had previously distributed $32 million to its ordinary shareholders, including the distribution of approximately $7 million paid to officers and employees of the Company who held ordinary shares of New SAC.

On May 20, 2002, the Company made a distribution to its
shareholders, including New SAC, to enable New SAC to make a distribution to its preferred shareholders. The aggregate amount of the shareholder distribution was approximately $167 million. Of this amount, approximately $166 million was paid to New
SAC. New SAC in turn made a distribution to its preferred shareholders in May 2002 of the entire $166 million, including the distribution of $5 million to officers and employees of the Company who held preferred shares of New SAC. The payment of
this distribution on preferred shares by New SAC triggered a required payment by the Company under its deferred compensation plan of $32 million that was paid in May 2002.

On December 9, 2002, prior to the initial public offering of common stock of the Company, New SAC converted all its
then-outstanding 400 million preferred shares into common shares of the Company. On December 13, 2002, the Company completed the initial public offering of 72,500,000 of its common shares, 24,000,000 of which were sold by the Company and 48,500,000
of which were sold by New SAC, its parent company, as selling shareholder, at a price of $12 per share. The Company received proceeds from its sale of the 24,000,000 newly issued common shares of approximately $270 million after deducting
underwriting fees, discounts and commissions. Immediately prior to the closing of the Company’s initial public offering, it paid a return of capital distribution of $262 million, or $0.65 per share, to the holders of its then-outstanding
shares, including New SAC, which received $259 million. The Company also paid a lump sum of approximately $12 million to members of its sponsor group in exchange for the discontinuation of an annual monitoring fee of $2 million. This payment was
charged to marketing and administrative expense during the quarter ended December 27, 2002. New SAC received proceeds of approximately $557 million from the sale of 48,500,000 common shares in the Company’s initial public offering, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. New SAC distributed the $557 million net proceeds from the offering and the $259 million return of capital distribution from the Company to its preferred and ordinary shareholders, including a total
payment of approximately $38 million to officers and employees of the Company who held preferred and ordinary shares of New SAC. The distribution by New SAC to its preferred stock holders triggered the requirement by the Company to pay its remaining
deferred compensation plan obligation to its participating officers and employees totaling $147 million which was paid in December 2002.

In July 2003, the Company completed the secondary public offering of 69,000,000 of its common shares, all of which were sold by New SAC, its parent
company, as selling shareholder. See Note 17. Subsequent Events—Consummation of Secondary Public Offering.

In February 2003 and May 2003, the Company paid a total of approximately $26 million in distributions to its shareholders. Of the $26 million paid, New
SAC received approximately $21 million. New SAC in turn distributed the $21 million it received to its ordinary shareholders, including approximately $5 million paid to officers and employees of the Company who held ordinary shares of New SAC.

16. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information

On May 13, 2002, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, or HDD, issued $400
million in aggregate principal amount of 8% senior notes due 2009. HDD is the Company’s wholly-owned direct subsidiary, and the Company has guaranteed HDD’s obligations under the 8% senior notes, on a joint and several, full and
unconditional basis. The following tables present parent guarantor, subsidiary issuer and combined non-guarantors condensed consolidating balance sheets of the Company and its subsidiaries at June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002 and the condensed
consolidating results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002. The information classifies the Company’s subsidiaries into Seagate Technology-parent company guarantor, HDD-subsidiary issuer, and
the combined non-guarantors based upon the classification of those subsidiaries under the terms of the 8% senior notes. The Company is restricted in its ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan under both the indenture
governing the 8% senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities. Under each of these instruments, dividends paid by HDD or its restricted subsidiaries would constitute restricted payments, and loans between the
Company and HDD or its restricted subsidiaries would constitute affiliate transactions.

Consummation of Secondary Public Offering

Under the Seagate Technology shareholders agreement among New SAC, the Company’s financial sponsors and the Company, New SAC has demand
registration rights to request from time to time that the Company register and sell shares of its common stock held by New SAC. New SAC exercised this right and on July 30, 2003, the Company completed the secondary public offering of 69,000,000 of
its common shares, including 9,000,000 shares subject to the over-allotment option, all of which were sold by New SAC, as selling shareholder, at a price of $18.75 per share. New SAC received proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $39 million. Direct expenses of the offering were borne by the Company aggregating approximately $1 million. New SAC distributed its net proceeds to holders of its ordinary shares including
approximately $245 million distributed to officers and employees of the Company who hold ordinary shares of New SAC.

consolidated and combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated and combined financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Seagate Technology at June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, and the
