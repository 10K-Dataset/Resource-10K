PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

We are a leader in the design, manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc drives. Rigid disc drives, which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard
drives, are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers, and consumer electronic devices to data centers delivering information over corporate networks and the Internet. We
produce a broad range of rigid disc drive products that make us a leader in enterprise applications, where our products are used in enterprise servers, mainframes and workstations; desktop applications, where our products are used in PCs; mobile
computing applications, where our products are used in notebook computers; and consumer electronic applications ,where our products are used in digital video recorders (DVR’s), gaming platforms, and digital music players.

We sell our rigid disc drives primarily to major original equipment
manufacturers, or OEMs, and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand name. For fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 60%, 61% and 66%, respectively, of our rigid disc drive revenue was from sales to OEMs, including
customers such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell, IBM, EMC, and Microsoft. We have longstanding relationships with many of these OEM customers. We also have key relationships with major distributors, who sell our rigid disc drive products to small OEMs,
dealers, system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world. Also, we are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers. For fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 30%, 34% and 39%, respectively, of our revenue came from
customers located in North America, approximately 30%, 31% and 31%, respectively, came from customers located in Europe and approximately 40%, 35% and 30%, respectively, came from customers located in the Far East. Substantially all of our revenue
is denominated in U.S. dollars.

Industry

Demand for Electronic Data Storage

We believe that the amount of data stored and accessed electronically is
growing rapidly and that there are a number of key factors driving this demand. We are particularly focused on three areas of growing demand for rigid disc drives:

Growth in Rigid Disc Drives for Consumer Electronics

.    High-performance computing and
communications functions and, increasingly, rigid disc drives are being incorporated into consumer electronics devices such as video game consoles, DVR’s and advanced television set-top boxes. In addition, faster connections to the Internet and
increased broadband capacity have encouraged consumers to download greater amounts of text, video and audio data, expanding the market for rigid disc drives for use in new consumer and entertainment appliances. The adoption and rapid growth of the
use of rigid disc drives in these applications will be facilitated by the development of low-cost rigid disc drives that meet the pricing requirements of the consumer electronics market.



Growth in Rigid Disc Drives for Mobile Computing

.    The mobile computing
market is expected to grow faster than any other PC segment as performance and price continue to improve, placing notebook computers in an attractive position relative to desktop computers. Notebook systems are increasingly becoming replacement
systems to desktop computers and progressively more desirable to consumers as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance. In addition, the industry continually progresses towards smaller systems and devices.

Growth of Storage Area Networks and Network Attached
Storage

.    The need to address the dramatic expansion in data storage management requirements has spurred the evolution of new storage and data management technologies. Enterprises are increasingly offloading network traffic
to dedicated storage area networks, or SANs. In addition, many enterprises are moving away from the use of server-attached storage to network-attached storage, or NAS. These solutions combine high-performance storage products that are comprised
principally of rigid disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies. We expect that the market for these solutions will grow rapidly and will result in greater opportunities for the sale of high-performance, high-capacity
rigid disc drives.

An emerging application in storage
networking is the use of near-line storage systems. This application uses less expensive discs to allow fast access to less frequently needed data.

Success in Our Industry Depends on Technology and Manufacturing Leadership

The design and manufacturing of rigid disc drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques,
especially in the areas of read/write heads and recording media. Rigid disc drive manufacturers are distinguished by their level of integration, which is the degree to which they control the technology used in their products, and by whether they are
captive, producing rigid disc drives for their own computer systems, or independent. Integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical technologies, including read/write heads and recording media, used in their rigid disc
drives. An integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently. In contrast, manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from
third-party suppliers, upon whom they depend for key elements of their technological innovation and differentiation. This can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing
efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the technology investment decisions of their suppliers. Independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with OEMs because they do not
compete with OEMs for computer system sales.

Due to the
significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate and improve manufacturing efficiency, the rigid disc drive industry continues to undergo significant consolidation as manufacturers and merchant component suppliers merge with other
companies or exit the industry. For instance, IBM merged its rigid disc drive business with that of Hitachi through the formation of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, a separate company. Consolidation is likely to continue in our industry as the
technological challenges and the associated levels of required investment grow, increasing the competitive necessity of large-scale operations. We believe the competitive dynamics of the rigid disc drive industry favor integrated, independent
manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers.

Overview of Rigid Disc Drive Technology

All rigid disc drives incorporate the same basic technology although individual products vary. One or more rigid discs are attached to a spindle assembly
powered by a spindle motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub. The discs, or recording media, are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved. Each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely
machined aluminum or glass with a layer of a



thin-film magnetic material. Read/write heads, mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player, fly extremely close to each disc
surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating discs. The read/write heads are mounted vertically on an e-shaped assembly. The e-block and the recording media are mounted inside a metal
casing, called the base casting.

Upon instructions from the
drive’s electronic circuitry, a head positioning mechanism, or actuator, guides the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved. Application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and ancillary electronic
control chips are collectively mounted on printed circuit boards. ASICs move data to and from the read/write head and the internal controller, or interface, which communicates with the host computer. Rigid disc drive manufacturers typically use one
or more of several industry standard interfaces such as advanced technology architecture, or ATA, Serial ATA which provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ATA standard, small computer system interface, or SCSI, and Fibre Channel.

Rigid disc drive performance is commonly assessed by six key
characteristics:

•

storage capacity, commonly expressed in megabytes, gigabytes or terabytes, which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disc;

•

spindle rotation speed, commonly expressed in revolutions per minute, which has an effect on speed of access to data;

•

interface transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data moves between the rigid disc drive and the computer controller;

•

average seek time, commonly expressed in milliseconds, which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disc surface,

•

data transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disc; and

•

product quality and reliability, commonly expressed in annualized return rates (ARR).

Areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disc. Current areal densities
are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today. Although the rate of increase in areal density is slowing, we expect the long-term demand for increased drive capacities to continue to increase as audio and visual data require
many multiples of the storage capacity of simple text. We have pursued, and expect to continue to pursue, a range of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase drive capacities and to enable the
production of higher capacity smaller form factor disc drives.

Manufacturing

We pursue an integrated
business strategy based on the ownership of critical component technologies. This strategy allows us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost, quality and availability. Our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility is a
critical element of our integrated business strategy. During the past several years we have made significant improvements in our manufacturing efficiency by:

•

consolidating the number of facilities we operate and reducing the number of personnel we employ;

•

expanding manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency and flexibility;

•

applying Six Sigma to improve product quality and reliability and reduce costs;

•

integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements; and

•

coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing and enhance our product quality and reliability.



Manufacturing our rigid disc drives is a complex process that begins with the production of individual components and
ends with a fully assembled unit. We design, assemble and/or manufacture a number of the most important components found in our rigid disc drives, including read/write heads, recording media, printed circuit boards, spindle motors and ASICs.

Read/Write Heads

.    The function
of the read/write head is to scan across the disc as it spins, magnetically recording or reading information. The tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our read/write heads are
manufactured with thin-film and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits. Beginning with six inch round ceramic wafers, we process more than 25,000 head elements at one time. Each of these head
elements goes through more than 300 steps, all in clean room environments. Our read/write heads require highly advanced processes with tolerances approaching the thickness of a single atom. We perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of
read/write heads at our facilities. Although the percentage of our requirements for read/write heads that we produce internally varies periodically, we currently manufacture all of our read/write heads.

Recording Media

.    The function of the recording
media is to magnetically store information. The domains where each bit of magnetic code is stored are extremely small and precisely placed. As a result, the manufacturing of recording media requires sophisticated thin-film processes. Each disc is a
sequentially processed set of layers that consist of structural, magnetic, protective and lubricating materials. Once complete, the disc must have a high degree of physical uniformity to assure reliable and error-free storage. We purchase aluminum
substrate blanks for recording media production from third parties, mainly in Japan. These blanks are machined, plated and polished to produce finished substrates at our plant in Northern Ireland. We also purchase glass substrates from third parties
in Japan for use in our mobile and small form factor consumer electronic products. Although the percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter, we currently manufacture almost all of our
recording media requirements. We are in the process of expanding our media production facility in Singapore to further increase our production capacity. Our strategy is to purchase no more than 20% of our recording media requirements from
third-party suppliers in any given quarter.

Printed Circuit
Boards

.    We assemble and test a significant portion of the printed circuit boards used in our rigid disc drives. Printed circuit boards are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and ASICs that provide the
electronic controls of the rigid disc drive and on which the head-disc assembly is mounted. We assemble printed circuit boards at our facilities in Malaysia and China.

Spindle Motors

.    We participate in the design of most of our spindle motors and purchase them
principally from outside vendors in Asia, whom we have licensed to use our intellectual property and technology.

ASICs

.    We participate in the design of many of the ASICs used in our rigid disc drives for motor and actuator control, such
as interface controllers, read/write channels and pre-amplifiers. We do not manufacture any ASICs but, rather, buy them from third-party suppliers.

Following the production of the individual components of the rigid disc drive, the first step in the manufacture of a rigid disc drive itself is the
assembly of the actuator arm, read/write heads, discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the head-disc assembly. The production of the head-disc assembly involves largely automated processes. Printed circuit boards are then mated to the
head-disc assembly and the completed unit is tested prior to packaging and shipment. Final assembly and test operations of our rigid disc drives occur primarily at facilities located in China and Singapore. We perform subassembly and component
manufacturing operations at our facilities in China, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Thailand, and in the United States, in California and Minnesota. In addition, third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various Asian
countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, and in Europe and the United States.



Products

We offer a broad range of 3.5-inch form factor rigid disc drive products for the enterprise, desktop and consumer electronics sectors of the rigid disc
drive industry. During fiscal year 2004, we introduced the Momentus family of 2.5-inch rigid disc drives for notebook computers. Also, during fiscal year 2004, we introduced Savvio, our first 2.5-inch enterprise disc drive. We offer more than one
product within each product family, and differentiate products on the basis of price/performance and form factor, or the dimensions of the rigid disc drive. Historically, our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in
technology, which contributed to rapid product life cycles; however, based upon the recent pace of new product introductions, we believe that our industry is currently in a period in which the rate of increases in areal density, which is the storage
capacity per square inch on a disc, is lower than the rate of the last several years, resulting in longer product life cycles. We list in the table below our main current product offerings.

In June 2004, we
announced 12 new rigid disc drive products which will be introduced in fiscal year 2005, including:

•

our first 1-inch form factor rigid disc drive, which will be primarily used in hand held consumer electronics devices such as digital audio players and digital cameras;

•

larger capacity 3.5-inch form factor rigid disc drives to address the market for larger capacity personal video recorders and home media storage devices and near-line enterprise
applications;

•

additional capacity models of our 2.5-inch form factor Momentus mobile computing rigid disc drive, which will more completely address our customers’ mobile computing disc drive
requirements; and

•

new versions of our current Barracuda and Cheetah desktop and enterprise rigid disc drives.

Many of these new product will address disc drive applications for which we currently have no product offerings.

Enterprise Storage

Cheetah Family

.    Commercial uses for Cheetah
rigid disc drives include Internet and e-commerce servers, data mining and data warehousing, mainframes and supercomputers, department/enterprise servers and workstations, transaction processing, professional video and graphics and medical imaging.

Savvio Family.

Savvio is our new
2.5-inch enterprise disc drive. This disc drive is our first enterprise disc drive in the smaller 2.5-inch form factor and, as such, allows the installation of more disc drives per square foot, thus facilitating faster access to data.

Desktop Storage

U Series X and Barracuda ATA/SATA Family.

The U Series X and
Barracuda ATA/SATA family of rigid disc drives are used in desktop applications, workstations and low-end server applications.



Consumer Electronics Storage

U Series and Barracuda ATA/SATA Family

.    The U-9 Series of rigid disc drives are used in new
markets, including personal video recorder (PVR), video game consoles, audio jukeboxes, home media centers, and home and industrial security systems. The Barracuda 7200.7 is used in PVR’s and the U Series X is used in PVR’s and gaming
applications. Our consumer electronics (CE) drives feature quiet acoustics, high reliability and high performance streaming.

Mobile Computing

Momentus Family.

Momentus is our introductory mobile computing rigid disc drive product. The current Momentus rigid disc
drives target only a portion of the mobile computing market. Commercial uses for Momentus rigid disc drives include notebook computers running popular office applications and laptops for business, government and education environments. Consumer uses
for Momentus rigid disc drives include home notebook computers, tablet computers and digital audio applications.

Customers

We sell our rigid disc drive products primarily to major OEMs and distributors. OEM customers incorporate our rigid disc drives into computer systems and
storage systems for resale. Distributors typically sell our rigid disc drives to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and other resellers. Shipments to OEMs were approximately 60%, 61% and 66% of our revenue in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Shipments to distributors were approximately 40%, 39% and 34% of our revenue in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales to Hewlett-Packard accounted for approximately 19% and 18% of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal
years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales to Hewlett-Packard and Compaq together accounted for approximately 20% of our rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal year 2002. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our rigid disc drive revenue in
fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002. Also, we are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Factors—Risks Related to
Our Business—Dependence on Key Customers.”

OEM
customers typically enter into master purchase agreements with us. These agreements provide for pricing, volume discounts, order lead times, product support obligations and other terms and conditions. The term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36
months, although our product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond this period. These master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products, or create exclusive relationships. Deliveries
are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders. In addition, with limited lead-time, customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to
materialize or OEM delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs.

Our distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements for the redistribution of our products. They typically furnish us with a non-binding
indication of their near-term requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled based on a weekly confirmation by the distributor of its requirements for that week. The agreements typically provide the distributors with price protection
with respect to their inventory of our rigid disc drives at the time of a reduction by us in our selling price for the rigid disc drives and also provide limited rights to return the product.

We also regularly enter into agreements with our customers, which obligate us
to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims. These agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customer against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of
third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products.



Sales, Marketing and Customer Service

Our sales organization focuses on deepening our relationship with our customers. The worldwide sales group focuses on
geographic coverage of OEMs and distributors throughout most of the world. The worldwide sales group is organized regionally among North America, Japan, Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) and Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In addition, we have a
sales operation group which focuses on aligning our production levels with customers’ product requirements. Our sales force works directly with our marketing organization to coordinate our OEM and distribution channel relationships. Also, we
are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers. We maintain sales offices throughout the United States and in Australia, China, England, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan.

Our marketing organization works to increase demand for our rigid disc drive
products through strategic collaboration with key OEM customers to align our respective product roadmaps and to build our brand and end- customer relationships. This organization is comprised of our strategic marketing, business development and
marketing communications groups. Our strategic marketing group coordinates with our research and development group to align our product development roadmap to meet key OEM customers’ technology requirements over the long term. Our business
development group coordinates the qualification of new products with OEMs, determines product pricing and provides product service and support. Our marketing communications group focuses on building the Seagate brand name among our OEM and
distribution channel customers.

We warrant our products for
periods ranging from one year to five years, and on July 26, 2004, we announced the introduction of our five-year warranty, effective June 1, 2004, on every Seagate internal PC, notebook and enterprise disc drive shipped through our distribution and
retail channels.

Foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange
controls and other restrictions, including, in the case of some countries, approval by the Office of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce and other U.S. governmental agencies.

Competition

The rigid disc drive industry is intensely competitive, with manufacturers competing for a limited number of major
customers. Some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among rigid disc drive manufacturers are:

•

storage capacity;

•

price per unit and price per gigabyte;

•

storage/retrieval access times;

•

data transfer rates;

•

product quality and reliability;

•

production volume capability;

•

form factor; and

•

responsiveness to customer preferences and demands.

We believe that our products are generally competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address. We summarize below our principal
competitors, the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life cycles and technology.

Principal Competitors

.    We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of
domestic and foreign companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources



than we have. These competitors include other independent rigid disc drive manufacturers such as Maxtor and Western Digital, as well as large captive
manufacturers such as Fujitsu, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Samsung and Toshiba. Because they produce complete computer systems, captive manufacturers can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components, which
reduces their need to realize a profit on the rigid disc drives included in their computer systems and allows them to sell rigid disc drives to third parties at very low margins. Many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because
they have more substantial resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do. In addition, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (together with affiliated entities) and Samsung Electronics Incorporated also sell other products to our
customers, including critical components like flash memory, application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and flat panel displays, and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy. We
also face indirect competition from present and potential customers, who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own rigid disc drives and other information storage products or purchase them from outside sources other than us. These
manufacturers also sell rigid disc drives to third parties, which results in direct competition with us. We expect that continued consolidation both among independent manufacturers and among captive manufacturers will increase the threat posed to
our business by these competitors. During the last few years, three additional competitors have entered the market; Cornice and GS Magicstor, offering 1-inch disc drives, and Excelstor as a contract manufacturer of desktop disc drives.

Price Erosion

.    Our competitors have
historically offered new or existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and customers, and we expect these practices to continue. Even during periods when demand for rigid disc drives is stable, our
industry is price competitive and vendors experience price erosion over the life of a product. Such price erosion has increased as product life cycles have lengthened due to a slowing in the rate of increase in areal density. This slowing of the
areal density curve may contribute to increases in average price erosion to the extent that historical price erosion patterns continue, product life cycles are lengthened, our competitors have more time to enter the market for a particular product,
and we are unable to offset this with new products at higher average prices. We expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future. To remain competitive, we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce our
prices. We have established production facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand to achieve cost reductions.

Product Life Cycles and Changing Technology

.    Historically, competition and changing customer preference and demand in the
rigid disc drive industry have shortened product life cycles and caused acceleration in the development and introduction of new technology. Based on the recent pace of new product introductions, however, we believe that the current rate of increase
in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years, and the resulting variability in product life cycles may make planning for product transitions more difficult. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to
develop, manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability which meet changing user needs and which successfully anticipate or respond to changes in technology and standards on a cost-effective and timely basis.

Research and Development

We are committed to developing new component technologies and products and
evaluating alternative technologies. We have increased our focus on research and development and realigned our rigid disc drive development process. This structured product process is designed to bring new products to market through predictable and
repeatable methodologies. Seagate Research, which is based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is dedicated to extending the capacity of magnetic and optical recording and exploring alternative data storage technologies, including perpendicular recording
technology and heat assisted magnetic recording technology. Perpendicular recording technology involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in rigid disc drives, and heat assisted magnetic recording technology uses
heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity. Our Advanced Technology Integration effort focuses rigid disc drive and component research on recording subsystems, including read/write heads and recording media, market-specific product
technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities. The primary purpose of our Advanced



Technology Integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to
leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, we had product development expenses of $666 million, $670
million and $698 million, respectively.

Patents and Licenses

As of July 2, 2004, we had approximately 2,456 U.S.
patents and 726 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1,194 U.S. and 1,204 foreign patent applications pending. The number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing
patent portfolio management activity. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the information storage industry, we believe that the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secret law, the protection of unpatented
proprietary know-how and development of new products are generally more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, we believe that patents are valuable to our business and intend to
continue our efforts to obtain patents, where available, in connection with our research and development program.

The information storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. Because of rapid
technological development in the information storage industry, some of our products have been, and in the future could be, alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties. From time to time, we receive claims that our products infringe patents
of third parties. Although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us, other claims have resulted in adverse decisions
or settlements. In addition, other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For more information on these claims, see “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings.” The costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation may be substantial regardless of the merit of the claim or the outcome. We have patent cross-licenses with a number of companies. Additionally, as part of our normal
intellectual property practices, we are engaged in negotiations with other major rigid disc drive companies and component manufacturers with respect to ongoing patent cross-licenses. For a discussion of the related risks, see “Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Potential Loss of Licensed Technology.”

Backlog

In view of customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty, we believe backlog in the rigid disc
drive industry is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results.

Employees

At July 2,
2004, we employed approximately 40,000 persons worldwide, of which approximately 30,000 employees were located in our Asian operations. In addition, we make use of temporary employees, principally in manufacturing, who are hired on an as-needed
basis. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels, and even then we cannot assure you of any such success. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to comprehensive U.S. and foreign laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our
operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities.



We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental laws,
regulations and permits. We incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, we could incur additional operating costs and capital
expenditures.

Some environmental laws, such as the U.S.
federal superfund law and similar state statutes, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the
owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites. At each of these sites,
the government has assigned to us a portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties.

Some of our current and former sites have a history of commercial and
industrial operations, including the use of hazardous substances. Groundwater and soil contamination resulting from historical operations has been identified at several of our current and former facilities and we are addressing the cleanup of these
sites in cooperation with the relevant government agencies.

While our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy, based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs, we do not expect costs in connection with
these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material.

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

Market Information

Our common shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “STX” since December 11, 2002. Prior to that time there was no
public market for our common shares. The high and low sales prices of our common shares, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, are set forth below for the periods indicated.

The closing price of
our common shares as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on July 30, 2004 was $11.47 per share. As of July 30, 2004 there were approximately 822 holders of record of our common shares. There were no sales of our equity securities during fiscal
year 2004 that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

Dividends

On January 29, 2004, our board of
directors amended our quarterly dividend policy, and pursuant to our amended policy, we increased our quarterly distribution to our shareholders to $0.06 per share ($0.24 annually) so long as the aggregate amount of the distribution does not exceed
50% of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100% of net cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital for the period beginning June 30, 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter in which financial statements are internally
available.

We are restricted in our ability to pay
distributions by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities. Our declaration of distributions is also subject to Cayman Islands law and the discretion
of our board of directors. Under the terms of the Seagate Technology shareholders agreement, at least seven members of our board of directors must approve the payment of distributions in excess of 15% of our net income in the prior fiscal year. In
deciding whether or not to declare quarterly distributions, our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry, our financial results, our capital requirements, contractual and legal
restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.

Pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy, we made quarterly distributions of
(i) $0.03 per share to our shareholders of record as of each of February 14, 2003 and May 9, 2003; (ii) $0.04 per share on each of August 22, 2003 and November 21, 2003 to our shareholders of record as of August 8, 2003 and November 7, 2003,
respectively; and (iii) $0.06 per share on each of February 27, 2004 and May 21, 2004 to our shareholders of record as of February 13, 2004 and May 7, 2004, respectively. On July 19, 2004, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of
$0.06 per share to be paid on or before August 20, 2004 to our shareholders of record as of August 6, 2004.

Since the closing of our initial public offering in December 2002, we have made distributions, pursuant to our quarterly dividend policy totaling
approximately $116 million in the aggregate.



Within the two most recent fiscal years, we have made additional distributions unrelated to our quarterly
dividend policy. These include:

•

an in-kind distribution of a $32 million promissory note to our shareholders of record immediately following our sale of XIOtech Corporation on November 4, 2002; and

•

a distribution of approximately $262 million to the holders of our then-outstanding shares immediately prior to our initial public offering.

To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and
accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, the distribution will be treated as a return of capital for U.S. tax purposes, causing a reduction in a shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common
shares. We did not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended July 2, 2004 and, accordingly, distributions paid on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of
capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurances that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes in future years. To the extent that we do have current or accumulated
earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a distribution on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital distribution and will be treated as dividend income.

Furthermore, we currently believe that we are a foreign personal holding
company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under recent U.S. federal income tax legislation, U.S. shareholders who are individuals will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income (currently a maximum rate
of 15%) on distributions on our common shares if we qualify as a foreign personal holding company in the year in which such distributions were made or in the preceding taxable year.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended July 2,
2004, the fiscal year ended June 27, 2003, and the fiscal year ended June 28, 2002. Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used herein, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Seagate Technology, an exempted company
incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and its subsidiaries. New SAC, a Cayman Islands limited liability corporation is our controlling shareholder. We were formed in August 2000 to be a holding company for the
rigid disc drive operating business and the storage area networks operating business of Seagate Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to herein as “Seagate Delaware.” In November 2000, we acquired the rigid disc drive
business and the storage area networks business of Seagate Delaware in a series of transactions that we refer to herein as the November 2000 transactions. We sold XIOtech Corporation, our storage area networks operating business, in November 2002.

You should read this discussion in conjunction with
“Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included elsewhere in this report. Except as noted, references to any fiscal year mean the twelve-month period ending on the Friday
closest to June 30 of that year.

Our Company

We are a leader in the design, manufacturing and marketing of rigid disc
drives. Rigid disc drives, which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives, are used as the primary medium for storing electronic information in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers and consumer electronic devices to data
centers delivering information over corporate networks and the Internet. We produce a broad range of rigid disc drive products that make us a leader in enterprise applications, where our products are primarily used in enterprise servers, mainframes
and workstations; desktop applications, where our products are used in PC’s; mobile computing applications, where our products are used in notebook computers; and consumer electronic applications, where our products are used in digital video
recorders (DVR’s), gaming platforms, and digital music players.

We sell our rigid disc drives primarily to major OEMs and also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand name. For fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 60%, 61% and 66%, respectively, of our rigid disc drive
revenue was from sales to OEMs, including customers such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell, IBM, EMC, and Microsoft. We have longstanding relationships with many of these OEM customers. We also have key relationships with major distributors, who sell our
rigid disc drive products to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world. Also, we are currently expanding our direct sales to retailers. For fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 30%, 34% and 39%,
respectively, of our revenue came from customers located in North America, approximately 30%, 31% and 31%, respectively, came from customers located in Europe and approximately 40%, 35% and 30%, respectively, came from customers located in the Far
East. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.

November 2000 Transactions

Prior to
November 22, 2000, Suez Acquisition Company, the predecessor to New SAC, entered into a stock purchase agreement with Seagate Delaware and Seagate Software Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Seagate Delaware. Concurrently, Seagate Delaware and VERITAS
Software Corporation (“VERITAS”) entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization. Suez Acquisition Company was an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and formed solely
for the purpose of entering into the stock purchase agreement and undertaking the related acquisitions. Suez Acquisition Company later assigned all of its rights and obligations under the stock purchase agreement to New SAC, an exempted company
incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and formed for the same purpose. At the closing of those transactions, New SAC owned 400,000,000 shares of our preferred stock.



An indemnification agreement provided that New SAC and its subsidiaries would be required to indemnify
VERITAS and its affiliates for specified liabilities of Seagate Delaware and Seagate Software Holdings, Inc., including selected taxes. In return, VERITAS, Seagate Delaware and their affiliates agreed to indemnify New SAC and its subsidiaries for
specified liabilities, including all taxes of Seagate Delaware for which New SAC would not be obligated to indemnify VERITAS and its affiliates. VERITAS deposited $150 million in an escrow account, which could be applied by New SAC to satisfy
certain tax liabilities, and which remained in the escrow account in full. To the extent that any part of the $150 million was not utilized to satisfy these tax liabilities, it would be paid out to the former Seagate Delaware stockholders. In July
2002, we, and those of our affiliates that were parties to the indemnification agreement entered into a reimbursement agreement, which allocated the respective liabilities and obligations under the indemnification agreement.

Under the reimbursement agreement, if we and our affiliates became obligated
to indemnify Seagate Delaware, VERITAS or any of their affiliates for tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings would be responsible for the first $125 million of the tax liabilities, and any amount
exceeding $125 million would then be allocated among Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, Seagate Technology SAN Holdings, Certance Holdings and Seagate Software (Cayman) Holdings Corporation on a pro rata basis in accordance with the portion of the
purchase price allocated to each entity in connection with the November 2000 transactions. For indemnification obligations other than tax liabilities under the indemnification agreement, the responsible entity would reimburse any entity that
satisfied the obligation on its behalf.

On July 31, 2001,
Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service filed a settlement stipulation with the United States Tax Court in complete settlement of the remaining disputed tax matter reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated June 12, 1998. The
settlement stipulation was expressly contingent upon Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service entering into a closing agreement in connection with certain tax matters arising in all or some part of the open tax years of Seagate Delaware and
New SAC. The Internal Revenue Service completed its review of Seagate Delaware’s federal tax returns for the periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets and submitted its conclusions to the congressional Joint Committee on
Taxation for review. On March 15, 2004, VERITAS received written notification from the Internal Revenue Service that the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation had completed its review and had taken no exception to the Internal Revenue
Service’s conclusions.

As a result of the conclusion of
the tax audits with no additional tax due, and based on the March 15, 2004 notification to VERITAS from the Internal Revenue Service, we recorded a $125 million income tax benefit in our third fiscal quarter of 2004 from the reversal of accrued
income taxes relating to the tax indemnification amounts due to VERITAS pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement between Seagate Delaware, New SAC and VERITAS.

Management Rollover

In connection with the November 2000 transactions, approximately 100 members of Seagate Delaware’s management group entered into rollover agreements
under which they agreed not to receive merger consideration consisting of a portion of their restricted shares of Seagate Delaware’s common stock and unvested options to purchase those shares. The aggregate value of this foregone consideration
was approximately $184 million. Instead of receiving this merger consideration, members of the management group received 1,843,000 restricted ordinary and 48,500 preferred shares of New SAC and approximately $179 million in participation interests
in our deferred compensation plan.

The restricted ordinary and
preferred shares of New SAC and the interests in our deferred compensation plan were scheduled to vest as follows:

•

one-third on November 22, 2001;

•

one-third proportionately each month over the 18 months following November 22, 2001; and

•

the final one-third on May 22, 2003.



In addition, at the closing of the November 2000 transactions certain individuals purchased additional
ordinary and preferred shares of New SAC for approximately $41 million in cash. Of this $41 million, approximately $21 million was purchased by members of the management group.

Following the closing of the November 2000 transactions, New SAC has issued 483,835 restricted ordinary shares to
management, employees, directors and consultants of New SAC and its affiliates. These ordinary shares were scheduled to vest as follows:

•

25% of the shares on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date; and

•

75% of the shares proportionately each month over the 36 months following the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date.

In May 2002, we made $32 million in payments to participants in the deferred
compensation plan. On June 19, 2002, the board of directors accelerated vesting of all deferred compensation interests under the terms of the plan and we subsequently recorded an accrual of $147 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002. As a
result of certain distributions by New SAC to holders of its preferred shares in connection with our initial public offering, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings became obligated to pay out the $147 million to participants of its deferred compensation
plan, including named executive officers. Those payments were made following the closing of our initial public offering, thereby satisfying all remaining obligations under the deferred compensation plan.

New SAC redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares as of March 14,
2003. As of July 2, 2004, there were 2,251,011 restricted ordinary shares outstanding. We have been recognizing, and will continue to recognize, compensation expense of approximately $28 million proportionately over the respective vesting periods
based on the estimated fair value of these shares of the date of issuance. Through July 2, 2004, we had recognized $27 million of this compensation expense.

Consummation of Initial Public Offering

In December 2002, we completed the initial public offering of 72,500,000 of our common shares, 24,000,000 of which were sold
by us and 48,500,000 of which were sold by New SAC, our controlling shareholder, at a price of $12 per share. We received proceeds from our sale of the 24,000,000 newly issued common shares of approximately $270 million after deducting underwriting
fees, discounts and commissions. In connection with our initial public offering, New SAC converted its 400,000,000 shares of our preferred stock, into common stock. Immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering, we paid a return of
capital distribution of $262 million, or $0.65 per share, to the holders of our then-outstanding shares, including New SAC. We also paid a lump sum of approximately $12 million to members of our sponsor group in exchange for the discontinuation of
an annual monitoring fee of $2 million. This payment was charged to marketing and administrative expense during our second fiscal quarter of 2002.

New SAC received proceeds of approximately $557 million from the sale of 48,500,000 common shares in our initial public offering, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions. New SAC distributed these net proceeds, together with the proceeds from the distribution described above, to holders of its preferred and ordinary shares. As a result of the distribution to New SAC’s
preferred shareholders, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, became obligated to make payments of approximately $147 million to the participants in its deferred compensation plan. These payments were made following the
closing of our initial public offering, and as a consequence there are no longer any outstanding obligations under that deferred compensation plan.

Consummation of Secondary Public Offering

Under the Seagate Technology shareholders agreement among New SAC, our financial sponsors and us, New SAC has demand registration rights to request from
time to time that we register to sell shares of our



common stock held by New SAC. New SAC exercised this right and on July 30, 2003, we completed the secondary public offering of 69,000,000 of our common
shares, of which 9,000,000 were sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option, all of which were sold by New SAC, as selling shareholder, at a price of $18.75 per share. New SAC received proceeds of approximately
$1.3 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $39 million. We incurred direct expenses aggregating approximately $1 million related to the offering. New SAC distributed its net proceeds to holders of its
ordinary shares including approximately $245 million distributed to our officers and employees who hold ordinary shares of New SAC. As of July 2, 2004, New SAC owned 282,500,000 shares, or approximately 61.5% of our outstanding common stock.

Registration of Common Shares

On July 20, 2004, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with respect
to 60,000,000 of our common shares owned by New SAC. After this registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, New SAC may sell all 60,000,000 of these shares to the public. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the potential sale
of these shares. After such sale or sales of these common shares is completed, New SAC will own 222,500,000 shares, or approximately 48.4% of our outstanding common stock (based upon our outstanding common shares as of July 2, 2004).

Overview

Industry Overview.

Our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact
on our strategic planning, financial condition and results of operations. Historically, our industry has been characterized by continuous and significant advances in technology, which contributed to rapid product life cycles, the importance of being
first to market with new products and the difficulty in recovering research and development expenses. However, based upon the recent pace of new product introductions, we believe that our industry is currently in a period in which the rate of
increases in areal density, which is the storage capacity per square inch on a disc, is lower than the rate of the last several years. The slowing change in areal density contributes to:

•

an increase in the rates of price erosion as the slowing areal density curve results in longer product cycles which permits more competitors time to enter the market for a
particular type of disc drive and, accordingly, increases competition based on price;

•

an increased importance of successfully executing product transitions, as factors such as quality, reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance;
and

•

a potential reduction in financial benefit from new product introductions due to declining cost reductions and the inability to introduce new products at higher prices in
traditional hard disc drive markets.

We also believe that the
industry is experiencing several positive trends relative to overall demand including:

•

a proliferation of applications in the consumer electronics market that utilize disc drives. We estimate that in the most recent quarter industry shipments of disc drives to
non-gaming consumer electronic applications grew in excess of 200% from the year-ago quarter;

•

a renewed buying cycle for consumer and commercial client computing systems. We estimate that in the most recent quarter industry shipments of disc drives for desktop and mobile
computing storage applications grew 13% from the year-ago quarter, with the desktop market increasing approximately 10% and the mobile computing market increasing 25%. We believe that a portion of the growth in the mobile computing market is a
result of consumers shifting from desktop computers to notebook computers, a trend that we believe may be accelerating; and

•

growth in selected enterprise storage applications such as near-line and small form factor.



In the first half of fiscal year 2004, we observed what we believe to be a shift in seasonal demand for
disc drives used in desktop and consumer electronics markets. We believe the seasonally high demand for disc drives used in these markets may be shifting more toward our first fiscal quarter from our second fiscal quarter. We believe this trend will
continue and, due to the increasing importance of the consumer electronics market to our business, will impact our revenue and results of operations in these quarters.

Another key factor is the continued importance of sales to the distribution channel. Product qualification programs in this
channel are limited, which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand, particularly in times of lengthening product cycles. As a result, purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price, terms and
product availability and unit sales growth is less predictable and has greater fluctuation than sales to OEM customers. To the extent that our industry builds product based on expectations of demand that do not materialize, distributors may
experience an oversupply of personal storage products that could lead to increased price erosion. As sales to distributors become an increasingly larger portion of total industry sales, disc drive manufacturers may experience increased volatility in
their results of operations.

Seagate
Overview.

We maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing components we view as critical to our products, such as read/write heads and recording media. We believe that our control of
these key technologies, combined with our innovations in manufacturing, enable us to achieve product performance, time-to-market leadership and manufacturing flexibility, which allows us to respond to customers and market opportunities. Although we
derive an important competitive advantage as a result of this strategy, it results in higher fixed costs, which may adversely affect our financial performance, particularly in periods of declining demand and in periods of slower growth in the areal
density curve such as we are now experiencing. To offset these higher fixed costs we are continuously engaged in efforts to reduce our costs and improve our manufacturing efficiencies and flexibility. This approach also increases the importance of
realizing and maintaining substantial market share in the markets in which we compete, allowing us to spread our technology investments across a high unit volume of products.

A significant portion of our success historically has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our
competitors. However, in the first fiscal quarter of 2004, our market share for our enterprise products was negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as the slowing areal density curve has resulted in longer
product cycles and more time for our competitors to enter the market for particular products. Additionally, in the second half of fiscal year 2004, our market share for notebook drive products was negatively affected by an oversupply condition in
our customers’ supply chain. During June 2004, however, we announced 12 new products, which will address every major computing application and all major consumer markets thereby expanding our current addressable market from approximately 75% to
approximately 97%. We believe that our near-term financial results will depend heavily on the successful introduction and customer acceptance of these new products.

We are dependent on our sales to distributors, however, in the distribution channel unit sales growth is less predictable
and has greater fluctuation than sales to OEM customers. To the extent that our industry builds product based on expectations of demand that do not materialize, distributors may experience an oversupply of personal storage products that could lead
to increased price erosion. During our second fiscal quarter of 2004, ended January 2, 2004, we observed lower than anticipated sell-through in the distribution channel. We believe our experience was consistent with that of our industry. We believe
that this lower than anticipated sell-through taken together with the level of industry production, created increased pressure on pricing and terms and resulted in historically high industry channel inventories at the end of the December quarter.
During the March quarter, a number of disc drive manufacturers independently launched initiatives to improve the stability of the distribution channel, particularly with respect to the purchasing behavior of distributors while other disc drive
manufacturers have not. These initiatives included efforts to develop point-of-sale information systems to help match supply and demand, pricing increases and alteration of distribution programs. As the distribution channel reacts to these various
activities, there may be increased volatility of sales in this channel for individual disc drive manufacturers. We exited the June quarter with approximately 5 weeks of distribution channel inventory, or



approximately one million units lower than the March quarter. To the extent that our distributor customers reduce their purchases of our products or prices
decline significantly in the distribution channel, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

During periods of slowing growth of areal density and longer product cycles we may experience heightened pricing pressures. This pricing pressure has
contributed to a reduction in gross margins. To the extent that these pricing pressures continue, our gross margin may be negatively affected. Furthermore, the favorable impact of new product introductions on our results of operations may be
minimized. Historically, the introduction of new products generally has had a favorable impact on our results of operations both because the new products are introduced at higher prices than existing competitive offerings and because advances in
areal density technology have enabled lower manufacturing costs through reduction in components such as read/write heads and rigid discs. However, in contrast to when the rate of growth in areal density is increasing, a slowing growth rate in areal
density can limit the cost benefits of new products because it is technologically more difficult to reduce the number of read/write heads and rigid discs in a particular drive. In addition, given the environment of intense price competition, in the
absence of significant capacity increases or improvements in reliability, it is difficult to obtain higher prices for new products.

We believe that we and the hard drive industry are in a unique and challenging period of time with longer product cycles, continued aggressive pricing in
the core markets and ongoing changes in how we serve our distribution channel partners. All of these may impact our near-term profitability. In our fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, we undertook significant restructuring activities to reduce the costs
of our operations in light of our declining revenue, gross margins, and earnings over the past several quarters resulting from recent significant price erosion and market share variability, particularly with respect to our enterprise disc drive
products. We continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions which may result in additional restructuring activities and restructuring charges in the future. During this challenging period, the management team will continue to be
intensely focused on maintaining profitability excluding the impact of any restructuring charges that we may incur.

Results of Operations

We list in the tables below the historical consolidated statements of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years indicated.



Fiscal Year 2004
Compared to Fiscal Year 2003

Revenue.

Revenue for fiscal year 2004 was $6.224 billion, down 4% from $6.486 billion in fiscal year 2003. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to price erosion, particularly with respect to our enterprise
storage products, partially offset by an increase in unit shipments. Our unit shipments increased from 68 million units in fiscal year 2003 to 79 million units in fiscal year 2004. This increase in unit shipments was primarily in our desktop storage
products and was due to an increase in the total available market, as well as our share of the total available market. Additionally, shipments increased as a result of the introduction of our mobile computing storage product.

Our overall average unit sales price for our rigid disc drive products was
$81, $80, $76 and $71 for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2004, respectively. Average annual price erosion from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2004 was approximately 18%.

Unit shipments for desktop storage disc drives were 59.0 million for fiscal
year 2004, up from 52.3 million in fiscal year 2003. However, we did experience a slight decline in drive shipments for desktop applications in the fourth fiscal quarter which can be attributed to an unexpected decline in industry distribution
channel sell-through. Despite this decline, we believe that we maintained our market share.

Unit shipments for enterprise storage disc drives were 10.4 million during fiscal year 2004, slightly down from 10.5 million in fiscal year 2003; and, although we continue to experience aggressive pricing, we believe
we maintained our market share.

During fiscal year 2004, we
shipped 3.6 million mobile computing disc drives. We continue to be impacted by our limited product set for this market and our concentrated customer base. We also experienced aggressive pricing in the first half of calendar year 2004. As we
leverage this product platform and expand our product offerings later in calendar year 2004, we expect to penetrate more of the mobile computing market and capture additional customers, revenue, and market share.

Unit shipments for consumer electronics storage disc drives were 6.3 million
during fiscal year 2004, which represents a 33% increase in shipments from fiscal year 2003. This reflects strong growth in shipments to DVR consumer electronics applications. Until now, we have only participated in the portion of the consumer
electronics market where 3.5-inch form factors drives are utilized. Beginning in our first fiscal quarter of 2005, we will add to our consumer electronics offerings with the previously announced ST1, our new 5 gigabyte,



1-inch form factor rigid disc drive targeted at a variety of handheld consumer electronics applications such as digital music players and digital cameras.

We continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at
increasing customer demand. We exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels, sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs. During
fiscal year 2004, sales programs issued and recorded as contra-revenue, were approximately 7% of our gross revenue, compared to 5% of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2003. The increase in the provision for sales programs as a percentage of our
gross revenue in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003 was the result of higher distribution unit sales, particularly in the first half of fiscal year 2004.

Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue for fiscal year 2004 was $4.765 billion and was flat from
$4.759 billion in fiscal year 2003. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2004 was 23% as compared with 27% for fiscal year 2003. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to price erosion as a
result of fewer new product introductions and longer product cycles caused by a slowing in the rate of increase in areal density. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the first, second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004 was 27%, 26%,
22% and 17%, respectively.

Product Development
Expense.

Product development expense decreased by $4 million, or 1%, for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003. The decrease in product development expense from fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to
decreases of $30 million in employee incentive compensation, a $6 million business development grant received in fiscal year 2003, $4 million in legal expense and the absence of $4 million in product development expense incurred in the year-ago
period by XIOtech which we sold in fiscal year 2003. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $21 million in salaries as a result of increased headcount and annual merit increases, $11 million in program materials and $7 million in
depreciation.

Marketing and Administrative
Expense.

Marketing and administrative expense decreased by $67 million, or 19%, for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003. The decrease in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2003 was
primarily due to the absence of $16 million in marketing and administrative expense incurred by XIOtech which we sold in fiscal year 2003, and decreases of $12 million related to the discontinuation of an annual monitoring fee paid to certain New
SAC investors, $7 million in compensation expense pursuant to executive terminations all of which occurred in fiscal year 2003, as well as $18 million in employee incentive compensation and $12 million in outside services.

Restructuring.

During fiscal year 2004, we
recorded $59 million in restructuring charges. Of the $59 million, $39 million was incurred in the quarter ended July 2, 2004 and was associated with the planned workforce reduction that we first announced in April 2004 and implemented in June
2004. The $39 million restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a workforce reduction, primarily in our U.S. and Far East operations, of approximately 2,407 employees, 1,626 of whom had been terminated as of July
2, 2004. We expect the restructuring activities related to the charge taken in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 to be substantially completed by August 2004.

The remaining $20 million in restructuring charges were incurred through the nine months ended April 2, 2004 as a result of a restructuring plan
established to continue the alignment of our global workforce with existing and anticipated future market requirements, primarily in our U.S. design centers and Far East operations. The restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination
costs relating to a reduction in our workforce of approximately 649 employees, 626 of whom had been terminated as of July 2, 2004. The restructuring activities taken through the nine months ended April 2, 2004 were substantially complete at July 2,
2004.

Upon completion of the fiscal year 2004 restructuring
activities, we estimate that annual salary expense will be reduced by approximately $95 million. We continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions which may result in additional restructuring activities and restructuring charges in
the future.



Net Other Income (Expense).

Net other expense decreased $15 million, or
48%, for fiscal year 2004 when compared with fiscal year 2003. The decrease in net other expense from fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to a decrease of $8 million in write-downs of our investment in a private company, a $4 million change in the
value of the underlying assets of the rabbi trust associated with the deferred compensation plan.

Income Taxes.

We recorded a benefit from income taxes of $101 million for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2004 compared to a
provision for income taxes of $19 million for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2003. We are a foreign holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with foreign and U.S. subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our
worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. These tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to
expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2015. The benefit for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2004 differs from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to income
before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs, (ii) an additional valuation allowance recorded for U.S. deferred tax assets, and (iii) the reversal of
the $125 million tax indemnification amount for VERITAS (further described below). Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2003 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S.
35% rate to income before income taxes primarily due to (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs and (ii) the realization of deferred tax assets that had previously been subject to a valuation
allowance. Based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to potential future increases in our valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax assets, we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the U.S.
federal statutory rate. Dividend distributions received from our U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes when and if distributed. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries,
as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the Cayman Islands or to U.S. federal income taxes if remitted to our foreign parent holding company.

As of July 2, 2004, we have recorded net deferred tax assets of $58 million, the realization of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate
sufficient U.S. taxable income in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Although realization is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered
realizable, however, may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters, when we reevaluate our estimates of future U.S. and certain foreign taxable income.

On July 31, 2001, Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service filed a settlement stipulation with the United States Tax Court in complete settlement
of the remaining disputed tax matters reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency dated June 12, 1998. On March 15, 2004, VERITAS received written notification from the Internal Revenue Service that the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation
had completed its review and had taken no exception to the Internal Revenue Service’s conclusions. On April 6, 2004, Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service filed a revised settlement stipulation with the United States Tax Court in
connection with the statutory notice of deficiency, which reflected the parties’ agreement to fully resolve the remaining tax matters included in the statutory notice of deficiency. On June 28, 2004, the revised settlement stipulation was made
final by the United States Tax Court and the case has been closed.

In the fiscal year ended July 2, 2004, we recorded a $125 million income tax benefit from the reversal of $125 million of accrued income taxes relating to tax indemnification amounts due to VERITAS pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement
between Seagate Delaware, Suez Acquisition Company and VERITAS. The tax indemnification amount was recorded by us in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware and represented U.S. tax liabilities previously accrued by
Seagate Delaware for periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets. As a result of the conclusion of the tax audits with no additional tax liabilities due, we determined that the $125 million accrual for the tax indemnification was
no longer required and it was reversed in our third fiscal quarter of 2004.



Certain of Seagate Delaware’s foreign and state tax returns remain under examination by various
taxing authorities. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining our federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in 2001 and 2002. The timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain. We believe that adequate amounts of tax
have been provided for any final assessment that may result.

Fiscal Year 2003 Compared to Fiscal Year 2002

Revenue.

Revenue for fiscal year 2003 was $6.486 billion, up 7% from $6.087 billion in fiscal year 2002. The increase in revenue was primarily due to improved unit sales volume that was substantially offset by
price erosion and a shift in mix to our desktop storage products as compared to our enterprise storage products. Our unit shipments increased from 55 million units in fiscal year 2002 to 68 million units in fiscal year 2003. This increase in unit
shipments was in both our desktop storage products and our enterprise storage products and was due to an increase in the total available market, especially for desktop storage products, as well as our share of the total available market.
Additionally, we experienced strong growth in shipments to non-gaming consumer electronics applications.

Our overall average unit sales price for our rigid disc drive products was $93, $94, $97 and $97 for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of
fiscal year 2003, respectively. Average annual price erosion from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 was approximately 14%. Price erosion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 was the lowest we have experienced in eight years. Over the past
few quarters, including seasonally weak periods, our industry has demonstrated operational discipline in managing production and inventory levels.

During fiscal year 2003, we continued to maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. We exercise a considerable degree of
judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor inventory levels, sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs. During fiscal year 2003, the total provision for
sales programs, recorded as contra-revenue, was approximately 5% of our gross revenue, compared to 4% of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2002. The increase in the provision for sales programs as a percentage of our gross revenue in fiscal year
2003 as compared to fiscal year 2002 was a result of the increase in the portion of our revenue derived from sales to distributors.

Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue for fiscal year 2003 was $4.759 billion, up 6% from $4.494 billion in fiscal year 2002.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2003 was 27% as compared with 26% for fiscal year 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue resulted from overall costs decreasing at a higher rate than price erosion and
was primarily due to improved absorption of fixed costs from increased unit sales volume. Ongoing cost savings as a result of our restructuring activities and our continued implementation of operational efficiencies also benefited our gross margins.
In addition, gross margins were enhanced by improved yields for products introduced during the last half of fiscal year 2003 as well as a trend toward increased price stability.

Product Development Expense.

Product development expense decreased by $28 million, or 4%, for
fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002. The decrease in product development expense from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the non-recurrence of deferred compensation charges incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and
our sale of XIOtech in November 2002. These decreases were partially offset by increased expense related to the opening of our new research facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which included employee, equipment and occupancy costs as well as
several new product introductions and our development efforts in smaller than 3.5-inch form factor rigid disc drives.

Marketing and Administrative Expense.

Marketing and administrative expense decreased by $141 million, or 28%, for fiscal
year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002. The decrease in marketing and administrative expense from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to the non-recurrence of deferred compensation charges of $112 million incurred in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2002, and decreases of $48 million as a result of our sale



of XIOtech in November 2002 and $21 million in the provision for bad debts. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $20 million in salaries and
related costs, $14 million in information technology expense and $7 million in depreciation expense.

Restructuring.

During fiscal year 2003, we recorded $19 million in restructuring charges. We also reduced a restructuring
accrual previously recorded by our predecessor in fiscal year 1998 by $10 million due to a change in estimated lease obligations. These combined actions resulted in a net restructuring charge of $9 million in fiscal year 2003. Of the $19 million,
$17 million was incurred in the quarter ended September 27, 2002 as a result of a restructuring plan, which we refer to as the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan, established to continue the alignment of our global workforce and manufacturing
capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements, primarily in our Far East operations. The restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a reduction in our workforce of approximately 3,750 employees.
We estimate that after completion of the fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities, annual salary expense has been reduced by approximately $12 million, excluding any savings in salary expense related to XIOtech, which was sold in November 2002. The
fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan was substantially complete at June 27, 2003. The remaining $2 million restructuring charge was incurred in the fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2003 and was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a
workforce reduction of approximately 686 employees in our Thailand operations. We estimate that after completion of these restructuring activities, annual salary expense was reduced by approximately $0.3 million. These restructuring activities were
completed in July 2003.

Net Other Income
(Expense).

Net other expense decreased $104 million, or 77%, for fiscal year 2003 when compared with fiscal year 2002. The decrease in net other expense from fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to decreases of $93 million
related to the debt refinancing charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and a $30 million reduction in interest expense in fiscal year 2003 as a result of lower average outstanding debt and lower average interest rates paid because of our
debt refinancing in May 2002. These decreases were partially offset by $10 million in write-downs of our investment in a private company in fiscal year 2003 and a decrease in interest income of $9 million resulting from lower average interest rates
and a lower average balance in our interest bearing accounts.

Income Taxes.

We recorded a provision for income taxes of $19 million for fiscal year 2003 compared to a provision for income taxes of $86 million for fiscal year 2002. We are a foreign holding company
incorporated in the Cayman Islands with foreign and U.S. subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or exempt from tax due to tax holidays and tax
incentive programs that we operate under in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2003 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to
income before income taxes primarily due to (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs and (ii) the realization of various deferred tax assets that had previously been subject to a valuation allowance.
Our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2002 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to income before taxes primarily due to the net effect of (i) the tax benefit related to the
aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs and (ii) an increase in our valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax assets. Based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to potential future increases in our valuation allowance for
domestic deferred tax assets, we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Dividend distributions received from our U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. withholding
taxes when, and if, distributed. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the Cayman Islands or U.S. federal income tax if remitted to the
foreign parent holding company.

As of June 27, 2003, we have
recorded net deferred tax assets of $74 million, the realization of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient U.S. taxable income in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Although realization is not assured, management believes that
it is more likely than not that these deferred tax



assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters, when we
reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and certain foreign taxable income.

Certain of our foreign tax returns for various fiscal years are under examination by taxing authorities. We believe that adequate amounts of tax have been
provided for any final assessment that may result from these examinations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following
is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and capital resources.

In May 2002, we refinanced all of our then outstanding indebtedness. Since that time, our indebtedness has consisted of $400 million in principal amount of 8% senior notes due 2009 and senior secured credit facilities
which consist of a $350 million term loan facility that has been drawn in full and a $150 million revolving credit facility, under which $113 million was available for borrowing as of July 2, 2004. Although no borrowings have been drawn under this
revolving credit facility to date, we had utilized $37 million of the credit facility for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of July 2, 2004. The credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities contains
covenants that Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, our wholly-owned subsidiary that operates our rigid disc drive business, must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement. These covenants require Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, among
other things, to maintain the following ratios: (1) an interest expense coverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of at least 2.50 to 1.00; (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio for any four consecutive fiscal quarters of at
least 1.50 to 1.00; and (3) a net leverage ratio of not more than 1.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. We are currently in compliance with all of these covenants, including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain.

The calculated financial ratios for the quarter ended July 2,
2004 are as follows:

Required

July 2, 2004

Interest Coverage Ratio

Not less than 2.50

31.46

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

Not less than 1.50

3.15

Net Leverage Ratio

Not greater than 1.50

(0.48

)

The degree to which we
are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances or other purposes and could make us more
vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures. Although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products or technologies,
we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We will require substantial amounts of
cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements. If we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or cash flow from
operations, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

Discussion of Cash Flows

At July 2, 2004, our working capital was $1.213 billion, which included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.183 billion. Cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments decreased $11 million from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2004. This decrease was primarily due to investments in property, equipment and leasehold improvements and distributions to shareholders offset by cash
provided by operating activities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises.



Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2004 was $635 million and consisted primarily of
net income plus depreciation and amortization partially offset by a reversal of $125 million in tax indemnification amounts.

During fiscal year 2004, we invested approximately $605 million in property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The $605 million investment comprised:

•

$179 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and test facilities in the United States and the Far East;

•

$157 million to expand our Woodlands thin-film media operations in Singapore;

•

$149 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for our recording head operations in the United States, the Far East and Northern Ireland; and

•

$85 million to upgrade the capabilities of our thin-film media operations in the United States, Singapore and Northern Ireland; and

•

$35 million for other purposes.

During fiscal year 2003, we invested approximately $516 million in property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The $516 million investment comprised:

•

$212 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and test facilities in the United States and the Far East;

•

$144 million to upgrade the capabilities of our thin-film media operations in the United States, Singapore and Northern Ireland;

•

$132 million for our manufacturing facilities and equipment for the recording head operations in the United States, the Far East and Northern Ireland;

•

$17 million for the purchase of a corporate aircraft; and

•

$11 million for other purposes.

For fiscal year 2003, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $351 million. This increase was primarily due to cash provided by
operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of our common shares offset by distributions to shareholders and investments in property, equipment and leasehold improvements.

Until required for other purposes, our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining
maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our short-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $635 million for fiscal year
2004, $882 million for fiscal year 2003, and $905 million for fiscal year 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for non-cash expenses for depreciation and
amortization and the benefit for the reversal of tax indemnification amounts. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization
and deferred compensation payments. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to net income as adjusted for non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, deferred
compensation and the write-off of debt issuance costs, and as adjusted to reclassify the cash payment for the redemption premium on the 12

% senior subordinated notes to net cash used in financing activities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $962 million for fiscal year 2004, $754 million for fiscal year 2003, and $610 million for fiscal year 2002. Net
cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements and the purchases of



short-term investments in excess of maturities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to expenditures for
property, equipment and leasehold improvements and the purchases of short-term investments in excess of maturities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and
leasehold improvements.

Net cash provided by (used in)
financing activities was $0 million for fiscal year 2004, $9 million for fiscal year 2003, and ($409) million for fiscal year 2002. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to distributions
to our shareholders and principal payments on our senior credit facilities offset by cash provided from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2003 was primarily
attributable to cash provided from the sale of our common shares partially offset by distributions to our shareholders. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2002 was primarily attributable to the refinancing and overall reduction of
all of our outstanding indebtedness, payment of distributions to our shareholders and payment of the redemption premium on the 12

Liquidity Sources and Cash Requirements and Commitments

On January 29, 2004, our board of directors amended our quarterly dividend policy and, pursuant to our amended dividend policy, we are paying and expect to continue to pay our shareholders a quarterly distribution of
up to $0.06 per share ($0.24 annually) so long as the aggregate amount of the distributions does not exceed 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100% of net cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital for the period beginning
June 30, 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements are internally available. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly distributions will be subject to, among other things, general business conditions within the
rigid disc drive industry, our financial results, the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings, and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, including
restrictions imposed by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes. Currently, the most significant restriction on our ability to pay dividends is under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities,
which limits annual distributions to $150 million. On July 19, 2004, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.06 per share to be paid on or before August 20, 2004 to our shareholders of record as of August 6, 2004.

Our principal sources of liquidity as of July 2, 2004 consisted of: (1)
$1.183 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, (2) a $150 million revolving credit facility, of which $37 million had been used for outstanding letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of July 2, 2004, and (3) cash we
expect to generate from operations during this fiscal year.

Since the closing of the November 2000 transactions, our principal liquidity requirements have been to service our debt and meet our working capital, research and development and capital expenditure needs. In addition, in the second half of
fiscal year 2002 and through fiscal years 2003 and 2004, we made distributions to our shareholders.

We believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our ability
to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future operations, performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors,
some of which are beyond our control. In addition, as part of our strategy, we intend to selectively pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions and investments that are complementary to our business. Any material future acquisitions, alliances or
investments will likely require additional capital. We cannot assure you that additional funds from available sources will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.



Our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of July 2, 2004 have been summarized in the table
below (in millions):

(1)

Includes total future minimum rent expense under non-cancelable leases for both occupied and abandoned facilities (rent expense is shown net of sublease income).

(2)

Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services, which are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specify all significant
terms.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of July 2, 2004, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet
arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

Equity
Plan Compensation Information

The following table sets
forth, for each of our existing equity compensation plans, the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights, the weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding options, warrants and rights, and the
number of common shares remaining available for issuance under such plans as of the end of fiscal year 2004.

(1)

This number includes 60,369,893 shares of our common stock that were subject to issuance upon the exercise of stock options granted under our 2001 Share Option Plan, and up to
2,500,000 shares that could be purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) in the purchase period that was in progress as of July 2, 2004. On July 30, 2004, the purchase date for that purchase period, a total of 2,484,105
shares of our common stock were issued pursuant to the exercise of the outstanding rights under the ESPP.

(2)

This value is calculated based only on the exercise price of options outstanding under the 2001 Share Option Plan. The exercise price for the rights awarded under
the ESPP in the purchase period in progress on July 2, 2004 could not be determined as of July 2, 2004. On July 30, 2004, the purchase date for that purchase



period, the weighted average exercise price for the shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding rights pursuant to the ESPP was $9.75 per share.

(3)

This number includes 9,014,310 shares of our common stock available for issuance under our 2001 Share Option Plan and at least 15,020,134 shares available for issuance under our
ESPP. In addition, the ESPP provides for automatic annual increases in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP at the start of each of our fiscal years (beginning with fiscal year 2004) equal to the lesser of (1)
2,500,000 shares or (2) one half of one percent (0.5%) of the shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year. However, the Board of Directors has retained the authority to reduce the number of shares thus determined even
further.

Critical Accounting Policies

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical
accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and operating results, and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. Based on this definition, our most
critical policies include: establishment of distributor sales program accruals, establishment of warranty accruals, and valuation of deferred tax assets. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We
also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts and valuation of inventory. We believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require
us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period.

Establishment of Sales Program Accruals.

We
establish certain distributor and OEM sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. These programs are typically related to a distributor’s level of sales, order size, advertising or point of sale activity or an OEM’s level of sale
activity or agreed upon rebate programs. We provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements. These estimates are based on various factors, including estimated future price erosion, distributor
sell-through levels, program participation, customer claim submittals and sales returns. During periods in which our distributors’ inventories of our products are at higher than historical levels, such as the second fiscal quarter ended January
2, 2004, our estimates upon which our recorded contra-revenue is based are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher. Significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which
we base our estimates could have a material effect on our operating results. In addition, our failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our financial condition and
results of operations.

We made changes to our distributor
sales programs commencing with our third fiscal quarter of 2004 that simplified the calculation of sales incentive allowances. Although these changes have the potential to reduce the level of estimation required in establishing sales program
accruals in future periods, no assurance can be given that this will be the case, particularly as we implement our new programs.

Establishment of Warranty Accruals.

We estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We
generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years. We use estimated repair or replacement costs and use statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine our warranty obligation. We exercise judgment in
determining the underlying estimates. Our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of a lack of past experience with those products upon which to base our estimates. Should actual
experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. The actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on us if the actual
rate of unit failure is greater than



what we used in estimating the warranty expense accrual. On July 26, 2004, we announced the introduction of our five-year warranty on products shipped into
our distribution and retail channels, and we expect that the impact of this change will increase our future warranty costs.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.

The recording of our deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on our ability to
generate current and future taxable income in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net
deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (“SFAS
149”) which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 except for the provisions that were cleared by the FASB in prior pronouncements. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a
material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” (“SFAS 150”). This statement establishes standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In accordance with the standard, financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are
required to be classified as liabilities. This Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and was effective in our fiscal quarter ended October 3, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a
significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FASB Statement No. 132, “Employers disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” (“SFAS 132-R”). This statement establishes standards that require
companies to provide more details about their plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and other relevant information. In addition to expanded annual disclosures, companies are required to report the various elements of pension
and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and was effective for our fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2004. Because the revisions only effect disclosure
requirements, the adoption of SFAS 132-R did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position.



Risk Factors

Risks Related to Our Business

Competition—Our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced significant price erosion and market share variability.

Even during periods when demand is stable, the rigid
disc drive industry is intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product. Our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain
market share and customers, and we expect these practices to continue. We may need to reduce our prices to retain our market share, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Based on our recent experience in the industry with respect
to new product introductions, we believe that the rate of increase in areal density, or the storage capacity per square inch on a disc, is slowing from its previous levels. This trend may contribute to increased average price erosion. To the extent
that historical price erosion patterns continue, product life cycles may lengthen, our competitors may have more time to enter the market for a particular product and we may be unable to offset these factors with new product introductions at higher
average prices. A second trend that may contribute to increased average price erosion is the growth of sales to distributors that serve producers of non-branded products in the personal storage sector. These customers generally have limited product
qualification programs, which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their demand. As a result, purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms. Any increase in our average price erosion would
have an adverse effect on our result of operations.

Moreover,
a significant portion of our success historically has been a result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors. However, in the first fiscal quarter of 2004, our market share for our enterprise products was negatively affected
by our customers’ diversifying their sources of supply as the slowing areal density curve has resulted in longer product cycles and more time for our competitors to enter the market for particular products. Additionally, in the third fiscal
quarter of 2004, our market share for notebook drive products was negatively affected by an oversupply condition in our customers’ supply chain. Any significant further decline in our market share would adversely affect our results of
operations.

Principal Competitors—We compete with
both captive manufacturers, who do not depend solely on sales of rigid disc drives to maintain their profitability, and independent manufacturers, whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced rigid disc drives.

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition
from a number of domestic and foreign companies, including other independent rigid disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as:

The term “independent” in
this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce rigid disc drives as a stand-alone product, and the term “captive” refers to rigid disc drive manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated entities produce complete computer
or other systems that contain rigid disc drives or other information storage products. Captive manufacturers are formidable competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on
individual components. Because components other than rigid disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a complete computer system than do rigid disc drives, captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a
profit on the rigid disc drives included in a computer system and, as a result, may be willing to sell rigid disc drives to third parties at very low margins. Many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more



substantial resources than we do. In addition, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (together with affiliated entities) and Samsung Electronics Incorporated
also sell other products to our customers, including critical components like flash memory, application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and flat panel displays, and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their
overall business strategy. This may improve their ability to compete with us. To the extent we are not successful competing with captive or independent rigid disc drive manufacturers, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

In addition, in response to customer demand for high-quality, high-volume
and low-cost rigid disc drives, manufacturers of rigid disc drives have had to develop large, in some cases global, production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls. The development of large production
facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of competition. We also face indirect competition from present and potential customers who evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own rigid disc drives or
other information storage products.

Volatility of
Quarterly Results—Our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause our stock price to decline.

In the past, our quarterly revenue and operating results fluctuated significantly from period to period. We expect this fluctuation to continue for a
variety of reasons, including:

•

changes in the demand for the computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our rigid disc drives, due to seasonality and other factors;

•

changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers, particularly as our competitors are able to introduce and produce in volume comparable product technology;

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices;

•

delays or problems in the introduction of our new products due to inability to achieve high production yields, delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues;

•

shifting trends in customer demand which, when combined with overproduction of particular products, particularly at times like now where the industry is served by multiple
suppliers, results in supply/demand imbalances;

•

the impact of restructuring activities that the company may engage in;

•

adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the United States and other major regions in which we do business;

•

our high proportion of fixed costs, including research and development expenses;

•

announcements of new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors; and

•

increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not
be an accurate indicator of our future performance. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors, which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the
trading price of our common shares.

New Product
Offerings—Market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted, and our results of operations will suffer if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated.

We are continually developing new products in the hope that we will be able
to introduce technologically advanced rigid disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors.



We recently announced 12 new rigid disc drive products which will be introduced in the current fiscal
year, many of which will address rigid disc drive applications for which we currently have no product offerings. Some of these new products introduce new form factors, such as our first 1-inch form factor rigid disc drive and our first 2.5-inch form
factor rigid disc drive for enterprise applications. Some of these new products also introduce higher levels of areal density than our existing products. We believe that our near-term financial results, including our ability to achieve the results
included in publicly announced forecasts will depend heavily on the successful introduction and customer acceptance of these new products.

The success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated
with product transitions, the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not
anticipated in the design of those products. Accordingly, we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our sales or results of operations.

In addition, the success of our new product introductions is dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of
supply with our OEM customers. In order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification, we must be among the leaders in time-to-market with those new products. Once a product is accepted for qualification testing, any failure
or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced. The limited number of high-volume OEMs magnifies the effect of missing a product
qualification opportunity. These risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products. We cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders
in time-to-market with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future.

Smaller Form Factor Rigid Disc Drives—If we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor rigid disc drives, our business may
suffer.

Increases in sales of notebook computers and
in areal density are resulting in a shift to smaller form factor rigid disc drives for an expanding number of applications, including personal computers, enterprise storage applications and consumer electronic devices. Many of these applications
have typically used rigid disc drives with a 3.5-inch form factor, which we currently manufacture. Notebook computers typically use 2.5-inch form factor rigid disc drives. We initiated volume shipments of our Momentus notebook disc drive to a number
of OEMs in the second fiscal quarter of 2004. These shipments materially contributed to our results of operations in the second fiscal quarter. However, our recently introduced products only address a limited portion of the existing notebook market
and in our third fiscal quarter of 2004, ended April 2, 2004, an oversupply of notebook disc drives in the supply chain led to a significant reduction in our shipments of Momentus which adversely impacted our results of operations. We recently
announced our first 1-inch form factor rigid disc drive, additional capacity models of our Momentus notebook disc drive and a 2.5-inch form factor disc drive for enterprise storage applications. These products are scheduled for introduction during
fiscal year 2005. If we do not successfully introduce these products or if we do not suitably adapt our technology and product offerings to successfully develop and introduce additional smaller form factor rigid disc drives, customers may decrease
the amounts of our products that they purchase which would adversely affect our results of operations.

Importance of Reducing Operating Costs—If we do not reduce our operating expenses, we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry.

Our strategy involves, to a substantial degree,
increasing revenue while at the same time reducing operating expenses. In this regard, we have engaged in ongoing, company-wide manufacturing efficiency activities intended to increase productivity and reduce costs. These activities have included
closures and transfers of facilities, significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation. For example, in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, we undertook significant restructuring activities to reduce the costs of our operations and
we



continue to look at opportunities for further cost reductions, which may result in additional restructuring activities in the future. We cannot assure you
that our efforts will result in the increased profitability, cost savings or other benefits that we expect. Moreover, the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in required
volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service. In addition, the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires qualification of the new
facility by some of our OEM customers. We cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a cost-effective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our customer relationships
and results of operations.

Industry Demand—Changes
in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems has caused and may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products.

Our rigid disc drives are components in computers, computer systems and storage subsystems and consumer electronic devices. The demand for these products
has been volatile. In a weak economy, consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for PCs and consumer electronic devices tends to decrease, as does enterprise demand for computer systems and storage subsystems. During economic slowdowns
such as the one that began in 2001, demand for rigid disc drives, particularly in the enterprise sector was adversely impacted as a result of the weakened economy and because enterprises shifted their focus from making new equipment purchases to
more efficiently using their existing information technology infrastructure through, among other things, adopting new storage architectures. Unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems generally cause sharp declines in
demand for rigid disc drive products.

Additional causes of
declines in demand for our products in the past have included announcements or introductions of major operating system or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences, such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers. We believe
these announcements and introductions have from time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete. Whenever an oversupply of rigid disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated
inventory levels, we experience even more intense price competition from other rigid disc drive manufacturers than usual.

Seasonality—Because we experience seasonality in the sales of our products, our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted
during our fourth fiscal quarter.

Because sales of
computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal, we expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for rigid disc drives. In particular, we
anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during our fourth fiscal quarter than the rest of the year. In the desktop computer, notebook computer and consumer electronics sectors of our business, this seasonality is partially
attributable to our customers’ increased sales of PCs and consumer electronics during the winter holiday season. In the enterprise sector of our business, our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end
users. Because our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been received, our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our
products proves accurate. Furthermore, it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods because our overall growth may have reduced the impact of this seasonality in recent periods. In
addition, the pattern of seasonal changes in demand may change. For instance, we believe demand for our products used in consumer electronics may be peaking in our first fiscal quarter, which is earlier than in the past.

Difficulty in Predicting Quarterly Demand—If we fail to predict
demand accurately for our products in any quarter, we may not be able to recapture the cost of our investments.

The rigid disc drive industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles, with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter.
Our manufacturing process requires us to make significant



product-specific investments in inventory in each quarter for that quarter’s production. Because we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a
quarter after we have made our investments, there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future.

Other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of investments in any given quarter include:

•

our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy, which means that we make more capital investments than we would
if we were not vertically integrated;

•

the timing of orders from and shipment of products to key customers;

•

unanticipated fluctuations in unit volume purchases from our customers, particularly our distributor customers who recently have accounted for an increasingly larger portion of our
total sales;

•

our product mix and the related margins of the various products;

•

accelerated reduction in the price of our rigid disc drives due to technological advances and/or an oversupply of rigid disc drives in the market, a condition that is exacerbated
when the industry is served by multiple suppliers and shifting trends in demand which can create supply demand imbalances;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions, particularly at our major manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand;

•

variations in the cost of components for our products;

•

limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers;

•

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign consumers; and

•

operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes.

Dependence on Distributors—We are dependent on sales to distributors, which may increase price erosion and the
volatility of our sales.

A substantial portion of our
sales has been to distributors of desktop disc drive products. Product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited, which increases the number of competing products that are available to satisfy demand, particularly in times of
lengthening product cycles. As a result, purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price, terms and product availability. Sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and subject to greater volatility than sales to
our OEM customers. Recently, a number of disc drive manufacturers independently launched initiatives to improve the stability of the distribution channel, particularly with respect to the purchasing behavior of these distributors while other disc
drive manufacturers have not. These actions have further increased the uncertainty as to demand within this market segment. To the extent that distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution
channel, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

Longer Product Life Cycles—Lengthening of product life cycles can make planning product transitions difficult and may reduce the favorable impact of new product transitions.

In contrast to historical trends, based on our recent experience in the
industry with respect to new product introductions, we believe that the current rate of increase in areal density is slowing from the rate of the last several years. We believe that this slowdown in the rate of increase in areal density will
continue until a significant advance in technology for the electronic storage of data, such as perpendicular recording technology, becomes commercially available.



When the rate of increase in areal density slows, it may contribute to increased average price erosion to
the extent historical price erosion patterns continue, a limitation in our ability to introduce new products at higher prices and lengthened product life cycles which permits competitors more time to enter the market for a particular type of disc
drive. In addition, the lengthening of product life cycles can make planning product transitions more difficult. To the extent that we prematurely discontinue a product, or do not timely introduce new products, our operating results may be adversely
affected.

Because the rate of growth in areal density is
slowing, the favorable impact of new product introductions on our results of operations may be minimized. Historically, the introduction of new products generally has had a favorable impact on our results of operations both because the new products
are introduced at higher prices than existing competitive offerings and because advances in areal density technology have enabled lower manufacturing costs through a reduction in components such as read/write heads and rigid discs. However, in
contrast to when the rate of growth in areal density is increasing, a slowing growth rate in areal density can limit the cost benefits of new products because it is technologically more difficult to reduce the number of read/write heads and rigid
discs in a particular drive. In addition, given the environment of intense price competition, in the absence of significant capacity or reliability increases, it is difficult to obtain higher prices for new products.

Industry Consolidation—Consolidation among captive manufacturers
may serve to increase their resources and improve their access to customers, thereby making them more formidable competitors.

Consolidation among captive manufacturers may provide them with competitive advantages over independent manufacturers, including us. For example, in
December 2002, IBM merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of Hitachi through the formation of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, a separate company. Hitachi is the controlling shareholder of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies
and is expected to assume full ownership at the end of 2005. As a part of this transaction, each of IBM and Hitachi agreed to multi-year supply commitments with the new company. Because IBM is one of our most significant customers and Hitachi is one
of our most significant competitors, there is a significant risk that IBM will decrease the number of rigid disc drives purchased from us and increase the number purchased from the new company. Moreover, economies of scale and the combination of the
two companies’ technological capabilities, particularly in the enterprise sector of our industry, could make the new company a more formidable competitor than IBM or Hitachi operating alone.

Importance of Time-to-Market—Our operating results may depend on
our being among the first-to-market and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products.

To achieve consistent success with our OEM customers, it is important that we be an early provider of new types of rigid disc drives featuring leading,
high-quality technology. Historically, our operating results have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the first-to-market with new product offerings. However, during a period of slowing areal density growth, such as we are in now,
the importance of time-to-market may be less critical. Our market share and operating results in the future may be adversely affected, particularly if the areal density curve resumes its historical rate of growth, if we fail to:

•

consistently maintain our time-to-market performance with our new products;

•

produce these products in sufficient volume;

•

qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers’ performance and quality specifications; or

•

achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and costs with these products.

If delivery of our products is delayed, our OEM customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production requirements. If the delay of our products
causes delivery of those OEMs’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed, consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the OEMs’ competitors.



Moreover, we face the related risk that consumers and businesses may wait to make their purchases if they
want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released. If this were to occur, we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may have become less efficient and cost effective compared to new products. As
a result, even if we are among the first-to-market with a given product, subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a positive return on our investment in existing
products and inventory.

New Product Development and
Technological Change—If we do not develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes, our operating results will be adversely affected.

Our customers have demanded new generations of rigid disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have
created the need for improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity, improved performance and reliability of smaller form factors. We, and our competitors, have developed improved products, and we will need to continue to
do so in the future. For fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, we had product development expenses of $666 million, $670 million and $698 million, respectively. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or
introduction of new products in a timely manner, that we will be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields, that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will
perform to specifications on a long-term basis. In addition, the impact of slowing areal density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful.

When we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology, our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and
complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems. If our products suffer increases in failures, are of low quality or are not reliable, customers may reduce their purchases
of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase. In addition, a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other rigid disc drive manufacturers.

Impact of Technological Change—Increases in the
areal density of disc drives may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity.

The rate of increase in areal density, or storage capacity per square inch on a disc, may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity. As a result, our customers’
storage capacity needs may be satisfied with fewer rigid disc drives. These factors could decrease our sales, especially when combined with continued price erosion, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in Information Storage Products—Future changes in the
nature of information storage products may reduce demand for traditional rigid disc drive products.

We expect that in the future new personal computing devices and products will be developed, some of which, such as Internet appliances, may not contain a
rigid disc drive. While we are investing development resources in designing information storage products for new applications, it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for rigid disc drive products. We cannot
assure you that we will be successful in developing other information storage products. In addition, there are currently no widely accepted standards in various technical areas that may be important to the future of our business, including the
developing sector of intelligent storage solutions. Products using alternative technologies, such as semiconductor memory, optical storage and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of
our products.

For example, semiconductor memory is much faster
than rigid disc drives, but currently is volatile in that it is subject to loss of data in the event of power failure and is much more costly than rigid disc drive technologies. Flash EEPROM, a nonvolatile semiconductor memory, is currently much
more costly than rigid disc drive



technologies and, while it has higher read performance than rigid disc drives, it has lower write performance. Flash EEPROM could become competitive in the
near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that required in traditional markets for our products.

High Fixed Costs—Our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs.

Our vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed costs and
requires a high volume of production and sales to be successful. During periods of decreased production, these high fixed costs have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. For
example, in 1998 our predecessor experienced a significant decrease in the demand for its products, and because our predecessor was unable to adequately reduce its costs to offset this decrease in revenue, its gross and operating margins suffered.
In addition, a strategy of vertical integration has in the past and could in the future delay our ability to introduce products containing market-leading technology, because we may not have developed the technology and source of components for our
products and do not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs.

Research and development expenses represent a significant portion of our fixed costs. As part of our vertical integration strategy, we explore a broad
range of ways to improve rigid disc drives as well as possible alternatives to rigid disc drives for storing and retrieving electronic data. If we fail to develop new technologies in a timely manner, and our competitors succeed in doing so, our
ability to sell our products could be significantly diminished. Conversely, if we over invest in technologies that can never be profitably manufactured and marketed, our results of operations could suffer. By way of example, we have incurred
expenses in exploring new technologies for storing electronic data, including perpendicular recording technology, which involves a different orientation for the magnetic field than is currently used in rigid disc drives, and heat assisted magnetic
recording technology, which uses heat generated by a laser to improve storage capacity. We believe these new technologies could significantly improve the storage capacity of rigid disc drives over the long term. To date, we have not yet developed a
commercial product based on these technologies. Furthermore, based on our recent experience in the industry with respect to new product introductions, we believe that the rate of increase of areal density is slowing as compared to its previous
levels, which has lengthened the life cycles of existing products and may further postpone returns on our investments in new technologies. If we have invested too much in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In
addition, as we replace our existing assets with new, higher cost assets, we expect that our depreciation expense will increase, which will contribute to our high level of fixed costs and reduce our earnings. This could cause the market price of our
common shares to decline.

Dependence on Supply of
Equipment and Components—If we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical equipment or components necessary to manufacture our products, we may suffer lower operating margins, production delays and other material adverse effects.

The cost, quality and availability of some equipment,
components and raw materials used to manufacture rigid disc drives and other information storage products are critical to the successful manufacture of these products. The equipment we use to manufacture our products is frequently custom made and
comes from a few suppliers. Particularly important components include read/write heads, recording media, application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, spindle motors and printed circuit boards. We rely on sole suppliers and a limited number of
suppliers for some of these components, including the read/write heads and recording media that we do not manufacture, ASICs, spindle motors and printed circuit boards. In the past, we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we
were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of some components and/or have been forced to pay higher prices for some components or raw materials, such as precious metals, that were in short supply in the industry in
general.

Due to the weakened economy in general and in the
technology sector of the economy in particular, the rigid disc drive industry has experienced economic pressure, which has resulted in consolidation among component



manufacturers and may result in some component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components.
In addition, the recent increases in demand for our mobile computing products, such as notebook computers, could lead to shortages in the components used in smaller form factor rigid disc drives such as the glass substrates used to make the
recording media for such drives. These events could affect our ability to obtain critical components for our products, including our recently introduced line of products for notebook computers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
our prospects and results of operations.

If there is a
shortage of, or delay in supplying us with, critical components, then:

•

it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and, if we could not pass these price increases to our customers, our operating margin would decline;

•

we might have to reengineer some products, which would likely cause production and shipment delays, make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a lower rate of
return on these products;

•

we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others, which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to lose sales to
customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations; and

•

we might be late in shipping products, causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors and, thus, causing our revenue and operating margin to decline.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain critical
components in a timely and economic manner, or at all.

Dependence on Key Customers—We may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced, delayed or cancelled purchases by, one or more of our larger customers.

For fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 62%, 63% and 63%, respectively, of
our rigid disc drive revenue. Hewlett-Packard accounted for approximately 19% and 18% of our rigid disc drive revenue for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales to Hewlett-Packard and Compaq together accounted for approximately 20% of our
rigid disc drive revenue in fiscal year 2002. If any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us, our results of operations would be adversely affected. While sales to major customers may vary from period to period, a
major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace. In line with industry practice, new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process at
the customer’s cost. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to attract new major customers.

Customer Concentration—Consolidation among our customers could cause sales of our products to decline.

Mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or other significant transactions
involving our customers generally entail risks to our business. For example, IBM, which is one of our key customers, merged its disc drive business with the disc drive business of Hitachi through the formation of a new company with which IBM has
entered into a multi-year supply agreement. As a result, IBM may decrease its purchases from us in favor of this new company. If a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these
key customers, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

OEM Purchase Agreements—Our OEM customers are not obligated to purchase our products.

Typically, our OEM purchase agreements permit OEMs to cancel orders and
reschedule delivery dates without significant penalties. In the past, orders from many of our OEMs were cancelled and delivery schedules were delayed as a result of changes in the requirements of the OEMs’ customers. These order cancellations
and



delays in delivery schedules have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the past and may do so again in the future. Our OEMs and
distributors typically furnish us with non-binding indications of their near term requirements, with product deliveries based on weekly confirmations. If actual orders from distributors and OEMs decrease from their non-binding forecasts, these
variances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Economic Risks Associated with International Operations—Our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange
fluctuations, longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries, seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets, tariffs and duties, price controls, potential adverse tax consequences, increased costs, our customers’ credit and access to
capital and health-related risks.

We have significant
operations in foreign countries, including manufacturing facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations. For fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 30%, 31% and 31%, respectively, of our rigid disc drive revenue were from sales
to customers located in Europe and approximately 40%, 35% and 30%, respectively, were from sales to customers located in the Far East. We have manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Singapore and Thailand, in addition to
those in the United States. A substantial portion of our desktop rigid disc drive assembly occurs in our facility in China.

Our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including the following:

•

Disruptions in Foreign Markets

.    Disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the past in some
countries, including those in Asia, have had an impact on our sales to customers located in, or whose end-user customers are located in, these countries.

•

Fluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates

.    Prices for our products are denominated predominately in U.S. dollars, even when sold to customers that are
located outside the United States. Currency instability in Asia and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency. Moreover, many of the costs associated
with our operations located outside the United States are denominated in local currencies. As a consequence, the increased strength of local currencies against the U.S. dollar in countries where we have foreign operations would result in higher
effective operating costs and, potentially, reduced earnings. Recent fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have had a negative effect on our operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that these fluctuations will not become more
aggravated and result in a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.

•

Longer Payment Cycles

.    Our customers outside of the United States are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our U.S. customers. This
increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period.

•

Seasonality

.    Seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months, particularly in Europe, typically result in
lower earnings during those periods.

•

Tariffs, Duties, Limitations on Trade and Price Controls

.    Our international operations are affected by limitations on imports, currency exchange
control regulations, transfer pricing regulations, price controls and other restraints on trade. In addition, the governments of many countries, including China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, in which we have significant operating assets, have
exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade.

•

Potential Adverse Tax Consequences

.    Our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences, including imposition of
withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries.

•

Increased Costs

.    The shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those associated with our
U.S. operations, resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries.



•

Credit and Access to Capital Risks

.    Our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest rates, reduced bank
lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer’s or its bank’s financial condition, or the inability to access other financing.

Political Risks Associated with International Operations—Our
international operations subject us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism.

We have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest. This could disrupt our ability to manufacture
important components as well as cause interruptions and/or delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly. Any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and
have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. U.S. and international responses to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the ongoing hostilities in Afghanistan and Iraq and the risk of hostilities with North Korea
could exacerbate these risks.

Legal and Operational
Risks Associated with International Operations—Our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management, legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property.

Operating outside of the United States creates difficulties associated with
staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities, complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance
with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject. We also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified.

Conflicts of Interest of our Directors and Officers—Our directors
and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of their ownership of capital stock of, and their employment with, our parent company and our affiliates.

Many of our directors and executive officers hold ordinary shares of our parent company, New SAC. Ownership of the capital
stock of our parent company by our directors and officers could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and for New SAC.

Some of our directors also serve on the board of New SAC.
Several of our executive officers also serve as officers and/or directors of New SAC as well as of other affiliates of ours. In view of these overlapping relationships, conflicts of interest may exist or arise with respect to existing and future
business dealings, including the relative commitment of time and energy by our directors and officers to us and to our parent company and affiliates, potential acquisitions of businesses or properties and other business opportunities, the issuance
of additional securities, the election of new or additional directors and the payment of distributions by us. We cannot assure you that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor.

Risks Associated with Future Acquisitions—We may not be able to
identify suitable strategic alliance, acquisition or investment opportunities, or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies.

Our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances with, and
making acquisitions of or investments in, other companies that are complementary to our business. There is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance, acquisition and investment candidates. We may not be able to identify suitable
acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates. Even if we were able to identify them, we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with, acquire or invest in suitable candidates, or integrate acquired technologies or operations
successfully into our existing technologies and operations. Our ability to finance



potential acquisitions will be limited by our high degree of leverage, the covenants contained in the indenture that governs our outstanding 8% senior notes,
the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur.

If we are successful in acquiring other companies, these acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating results, particularly while the
operations of the acquired business are being integrated. It is also likely that integration of acquired companies would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies. In addition, the integration
of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management, which may limit the amount of time available to be devoted to our day-to-day operations or to the execution of our strategy. Furthermore, the expansion of our
business involves the risk that we might not manage our growth effectively, that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments and that we would incur substantial charges relating to the write-off of in-process research
and development, similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions. Each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Potential Loss of Licensed Technology—The closing of the November
2000 transactions may have triggered change of control or anti-assignment provisions in some of our license agreements, which could result in a loss of our right to use licensed technology.

We have a number of cross-licenses with third parties that enable us to
manufacture our products free from any infringement claims that might otherwise be made by these third parties against us. A number of these licenses contain change of control or anti-assignment provisions. We have taken steps to transfer these
licenses in connection with the closing of the November 2000 transactions; however, we cannot assure you that these transfers will not be challenged. For example, Papst Licensing GmbH, IBM and Hitachi initially took the position that their license
agreements did not transfer to our new business entities. Subsequently, we entered into new license agreements with IBM and Hitachi in December 2001. In September 2002, we settled a broader dispute with Papst that also resolved the claim by Papst
that its license agreement was not properly transferred.

We
received a letter dated November 20, 2002 from Read-Rite Corporation asserting that we do not currently have a license to its patented technology and that our rigid disc drive products infringe at least two of its patents. We have since received
additional letters from Read-Rite Corporation making the same claims. Seagate Delaware entered into a Patent Cross License Agreement dated December 31, 1994, which covered the two patents referenced in the November 20, 2002 letter, as well as other
intellectual property of Read-Rite Corporation. Prior to the November 20, 2002 letter, Read-Rite Corporation had not responded to our efforts to confirm that under the Patent Cross License Agreement we were entitled to a new license agreement in our
own name and on materially the same terms as the 1994 agreement. In order to clarify the parties’ rights under the Patent Cross License Agreement, we filed a declaratory judgment action on May 7, 2003 in the Superior Court of California, County
of Santa Clara, seeking a declaration that we are entitled to a cross-license, effective as of November 22, 2000, under terms substantially identical to those contained in the Patent Cross License Agreement. On June 11, 2003 Read-Rite Corporation
answered the complaint putting forward a general denial and asserting various affirmative defenses. On June 17, 2003, Read-Rite Corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon notice, our
declaratory judgment action has been stayed. On July 23, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved Western Digital Corporation’s bid to acquire the assets of Read-Rite Corporation, including the intellectual property that was the subject of
Read-Rite’s dispute with us, in a transaction that closed on July 31, 2003. We objected to Western Digital’s assumption of the Patent Cross-License Agreement. On November 14, 2003, the Bankruptcy Trustee made a motion to assume or reject
certain Read-Rite executory contracts, rejecting the Patent Cross-License Agreement. We have given notice of our election to retain the benefits of the Patent Cross-License Agreement to the extent permitted by Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.

To the extent that third party cross-licenses, including
the Patent Cross License Agreement dated December 31, 1994 between Read-Rite Corporation and Seagate Delaware, are deemed not to have been properly assigned to us in the November 2000 transactions, our inability to either obtain new licenses or
transfer existing



licenses could result in delays in product development or prevent us from selling our products until equivalent substitute technology can be identified,
licensed and/or integrated or until we are able to substantially engineer our products to avoid infringing the rights of third parties. We might not be able to renegotiate agreements, be able to obtain necessary licenses in a timely manner, on
acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our products successfully. Moreover, the loss of or inability to extend any of these licenses would increase the risk of infringement claims being made against us, which claims could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Risk of
Intellectual Property Litigation—Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.

We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued
patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Historically, patent applications in the United States and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, and we may not be aware of currently filed patent
applications that relate to our products or technology. If patents are later issued on these applications, we may be liable for infringement. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents,
trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us, or our licensees in connection with their use of our products. We are currently subject to a suit by Convolve, Inc. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a suit
pending in Nanjing, China. In addition, as noted above, Read-Rite Corporation, in a letter dated November 20, 2002 and in correspondence since that date, asserted that we do not currently have a license to Read-Rite Corporation patented technology
and that our rigid disc drive products infringe at least two Read-Rite Corporation patents.

Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business. In addition, intellectual property
lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. Moreover, software patent
litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field. If we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we
would need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to reengineer our products
successfully. Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and lose the suit, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur
significant costs and prevent us from selling our products.

Dependence on Intellectual Property—If our intellectual property and other proprietary information were copied or independently developed by competitors, our operating results would be negatively affected.

Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and
preserve the proprietary aspects of our technology. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully
as in the United States, or protect us from independently developing or acquiring technology that is similar to ours. For example, in its bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Read-Rite Corporation’s patents and
other intellectual property rights were sold to Western Digital Corporation, who will use this intellectual property to compete against us. The use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage
we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail.

Limitations on Patent Protection—Our issued and pending patents
may not adequately protect our intellectual property or provide us with any competitive advantage.

Although we have numerous U.S. and foreign patents and numerous pending patents that relate to our technology, we cannot assure you that any patents,
issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive



advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Moreover, our competitors may already have applied for patents that, once issued, will prevail over our
patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our products in the United States or abroad. Our competitors also may attempt to design around our patents or copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology. With respect to our
pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims. Our failure to secure these patents may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover.

Disclosure of our Proprietary
Technology—Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or trade secrets.

We have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees and non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers and potential strategic
partners, among others. If any party to these agreements were to violate their agreement with us and disclose our proprietary technology to a third party, we may be unable to prevent the third party from using this information. Because a significant
portion of our proprietary technology consists of specialized knowledge and technical expertise developed by our employees, we have a program in place designed to ensure that our employees communicate any developments or discoveries they make to
other employees. However, employees may choose to leave our company before transferring their knowledge and expertise to our other employees. Violations by others of our confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements and the loss of employees who have
specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline. Our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by others, and trade secret laws provide no remedy
against independent development or discovery.

Service
Marks and Trademarks—Our failure to obtain trademark registrations or service marks, or challenges to those marks, could impede our marketing efforts.

We have registered and applied for some service marks and trademarks, and will continue to evaluate the registration of
additional service marks and trademarks, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee the approval of any of our pending applications by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to
oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries could limit our ability to use our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions.

Environmental Matters—We could incur substantial
costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws.

Our operations inside and outside the United States are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those
governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. In addition to the U.S. federal, state and local laws to which our domestic
operations are subject, our extensive international manufacturing operations subject us to environmental regulations imposed by foreign governments.

Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the United States, we could incur
substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or become non-compliant with environmental
permits required at our facilities. Contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites, principally in connection with historical operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several
superfund sites. While we are not currently aware of any contaminated or superfund sites as to which material outstanding claims or obligations exist, the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at
these or other sites could result in significant liability. In addition, the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. Liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can
be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. In other words, one liable party could be held liable for all costs at a site. Potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with environmental laws that may be
adopted or imposed in the future.



Dependence on Key Personnel—The loss of some key executive officers and employees could
negatively impact our business prospects.

Our future
performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing, sales and product development personnel. The loss of one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on
our business, operating results and financial condition. We believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract, retain and further motivate highly skilled management, marketing, sales and product development
personnel. A significant portion of the incentive compensation for our senior management vested in calendar year 2003 and substantially all of this compensation will have vested by November 2004. We may not be able to provide our senior management
with adequate additional incentives to remain employed by us after this time. We have experienced intense competition for personnel, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in
attracting, assimilating and retaining personnel in the future.

System Failures—System failures caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend.

Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer
equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by, among other things, earthquake, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events. As our operations become
more automated and increasingly interdependent, our exposure to the risks posed by these types of events will increase. A significant part of our operations is based in an area of California that has experienced power outages and earthquakes and is
considered seismically active. We do not have a contingency plan for addressing the kinds of events referred to in this paragraph that would be sufficient to prevent system failures and other interruptions in our operations that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Potential Tax Legislation—Negative publicity about companies located in certain offshore jurisdictions may lead to new legislation that could increase our tax burden.

Several members of the United States Congress have introduced legislation
relating to the U.S. federal tax treatment of U.S. companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions. While we do not believe that this legislation, as currently proposed, would adversely affect us, the exact scope of the
legislation and whether it will ultimately be enacted is unclear at this time. In addition, certain state legislatures have proposed similar legislation. Therefore, it is possible that federal or state legislation in this area, if enacted, could
materially increase our future tax burden or otherwise affect our business.

Risks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness

Substantial Leverage—Our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry.

We are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. Our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to
operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. For example, our high level of debt presents the following risks to you:

•

we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements;

•

our interest expense could increase if prevailing interest rates increase, because a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at floating rates;



•

our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared
to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;

•

our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other
business opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies;

•

our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic
acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and

•

covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay distributions or make other restricted payments and investments.

Significant Debt Service
Requirements—Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control.

Our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on, our
indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements. Our ability to generate
cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that:

•

our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;

•

we will continue to realize the cost savings, revenue growth and operating improvements that resulted from the execution of our long-term strategic plan; or

•

future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facilities or that other sources of funding will be available to us, in each case, in amounts sufficient to
enable us to fund our liquidity needs.

If we
cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt,
or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant amount of
additional debt. If we incur additional debt above the levels now in effect, the risks associated with our substantial leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs,
could intensify.

Restrictions Imposed by Debt
Covenants—Restrictions imposed by our existing debt instruments will limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.

Our existing debt instruments, including the indenture governing our
outstanding 8% senior notes, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us. The indenture governing our 8% senior notes limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if our consolidated coverage
ratio, which is the ratio of the aggregate consolidated EBITDA of our subsidiary, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings, the issuer of our 8% senior notes, and its restricted subsidiaries, to the total interest expense of those entities, is less than or
equal to 3.0 to 1.0 during any consecutive four-quarter period. Our existing debt instruments also limit, among other things, our ability to:

•

pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our shares;

•

redeem or repurchase shares;

•

make investments or other restricted payments;



•

sell assets;

•

issue or sell shares of restricted subsidiaries;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

create liens;

•

enter into sale/leaseback transactions;

•

effect a consolidation or merger; and

•

make certain amendments to our deferred compensation plans.

These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions that permit us to make significant distributions
of cash. In addition, the obligation to comply with many of the covenants under the indenture governing our 8% senior notes will cease to apply if the notes achieve investment grade status.

Our existing debt instruments also require us to achieve specified financial
and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control.

A breach of any of the restrictive covenants described above or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios
could result in a default under our existing debt instruments. If a default occurs, the holders of our outstanding 8% senior notes may elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be
immediately due and payable. If our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any future indebtedness, which would cause the market price of our common
shares to decline significantly.

Risks Related to Our Common Shares

Control by Our Sponsor Group—Because our
sponsor group, through its ownership of New SAC, will continue to hold a controlling interest in us, the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited.

As of July 2, 2004, New SAC owns approximately 61.5% of our outstanding
common shares. New SAC was formed in connection with the November 2000 transactions and is owned by our sponsor group and members of our management. Through their ownership of New SAC, as of July 2, 2004, affiliates of Silver Lake Partners, Texas
Pacific Group, August Capital, J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC and investment partnerships affiliated with Goldman, Sachs & Co. indirectly own approximately 19.5%, 13.6%, 7.0%, 4.0% and 1.3%, respectively, of our outstanding common shares. The
sponsors’ and our managements’ ownership of New SAC and New SAC’s and the sponsors’ ownership of us is the subject of shareholders agreements and other arrangements that result in the sponsors’ acting as a group with respect
to all matters submitted to our shareholders. As a result, as long as New SAC or the members of our sponsor group continue to own over 50% of our outstanding common shares, they will continue to have the power to:

•

control all matters submitted to our shareholders;

•

elect all of our directors; and

•

exercise control over our business, policies and affairs.

Even if New SAC holds less than 50% of our outstanding common shares and loses certain contractual rights under our shareholders agreement, it will
continue to have a significant influence over these matters. Also, New SAC is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party.

Accordingly, our ability to engage in significant transactions, such as a merger, acquisition or liquidation, is limited without the consent of New SAC,
which is controlled by the members of our sponsor group. Conflicts of



interest could arise between us, and New SAC or our sponsor group, and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us. The
members of our sponsor group may continue to retain control of us for the foreseeable future, even if New SAC distributes its shares in us to the New SAC shareholders. The members of our sponsor group may decide not to enter into a transaction in
which you would receive consideration for your common shares that is much higher than the cost to you or the then-current market price of those shares. In addition, the members of our sponsor group could elect to sell a controlling interest in us
and you may receive less than the then-current fair market value or the price you paid for your shares. Any decision regarding their ownership of us that members of our sponsor group may make at some future time will be in their absolute discretion.

Future Sales—Additional sales of our common shares
by New SAC, our sponsors or our employees or issuances by us in connection with future acquisitions or otherwise could cause the price of our common shares to decline.

If New SAC or—after any distribution to our sponsors of our shares by New SAC—our sponsors sell a substantial
number of our common shares in the future, the market price of our common shares could decline. The perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect. New SAC and our sponsors have rights, subject to specified
conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering common shares or to include common shares in registration statements that we may file. Specifically, any of New SAC, Silver Lake Partners, Texas Pacific Group or August Capital can
unilaterally require that we file registration statements covering common shares held by New SAC. In addition, either Silver Lake Partners or Texas Pacific Group can unilaterally cause New SAC to distribute its shares in us to our sponsor group and
New SAC’s other shareholders. By exercising their registration or distribution rights and selling a large number of common shares, New SAC or any of the sponsors could cause the price of our common shares to decline. Furthermore, if we were to
include common shares in a registration statement initiated by us, those additional shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common shares.

One component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions. In the event
of any future acquisitions, we could issue additional common shares, which would have the effect of diluting your percentage ownership of the common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline.

Volatile Public Markets—The price of our common shares may be
volatile and could decline significantly.

The stock
market in general, and the market for technology stocks in particular, has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. If these market or industry-based fluctuations continue, the trading
price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance, and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response
to several factors, including among others:

•

actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;

•

announcements of innovations, new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors;

•

our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts;

•

the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;

•

general stock market conditions;

•

the occurrence of major catastrophic events; and

•

changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts.



Failure to Pay Quarterly Distributions—Our failure to pay quarterly distributions to our
common shareholders could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly.

We made quarterly cash distributions of $0.04 per share on each of August 22, 2003 and November 21, 2003 to all of our shareholders of record as of August
8, 2003 and November 7, 2003, respectively, including New SAC. We made quarterly cash distributions of $0.06 per share on each of February 27, 2004 and May 21, 2004 to all of our shareholders of record as of February 13, 2004 and May 7, 2004,
respectively, including New SAC. On July 19, 2004, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.06 per share to be paid on or before August 20, 2004 to our shareholders of record as of August 6, 2004.

Our ability to pay quarterly distributions will be subject to, among other
things, general business conditions within the rigid disc drive industry, our financial results, the impact of paying distributions on our credit ratings, and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to
us or by us to our shareholders, including restrictions imposed by the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities. Any reduction or discontinuation of
quarterly distributions could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly distributions is reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying distributions at
historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares.

Taxation of Distributions—Certain U.S. shareholders may be ineligible for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment on distributions on our common shares.

Because we did not have any current or accumulated earnings and profits for
U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended July 2, 2004, distributions on our common shares during this period were treated as a return of capital rather than dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no
assurance, however, that we will not have current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes in future years. To the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
distributions on our common shares will not be treated as a return of capital distribution and will be treated as dividend income.

Furthermore, we currently believe that we are a foreign personal holding company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under recent U.S. federal income
tax legislation, U.S. shareholders who are individuals will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to certain dividend income (currently a maximum rate of 15%) on distributions on our common shares if we qualify as a foreign
personal holding company in the year in which such distributions were made or in the preceding taxable year. As a result, if distributions on our common shares are treated as dividend income because we have current or accumulated earnings and
profits in the taxable year in which such distributions are made, U.S. shareholders who are individuals may not qualify for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment under the new legislation.

Potential Governmental Action—Governmental action against
companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares.

Recently, several state and other governmental officials have threatened to take legislative and other actions against U.S. companies that have
expatriated to specific foreign jurisdictions. For example, the California state treasurer has requested that certain pension funds eliminate from their investment portfolios all public equity and fixed income holdings of companies that have
reincorporated in foreign jurisdictions. If we are included within the scope of such legislation or governmental action, it may reduce the demand for, and have a material adverse effect on the price of, our common shares.

Securities Litigation—Significant fluctuations in the market price
of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us.

Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of rigid disc drive companies and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be



volatile in the future. In the past, following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities, class action lawsuits have often been
pursued against that company. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity.

Limited Protection of
Shareholder Interests—Holders of the common shares may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.

Our corporate affairs are governed by our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, by the
Companies Law (2003 Revision) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial
precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the United States. Therefore, you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholder than would shareholders of a
corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, due to the comparatively less developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this area.

Unlike many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or
consolidation of a company. This may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the
consideration offered is insufficient.

Shareholders of Cayman
Islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company. Our directors have discretion under our articles of
association to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the
information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.

Subject to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors. Our
Cayman Islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court.

Anti-Takeover Provisions Could Discourage or Prevent an Acquisition of Us—Provisions of our articles of association and Cayman Islands
corporate law may impede a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of the common shares.

Our articles of association permit our board of directors to issue preferred shares from time to time, with such rights and preferences as they consider
appropriate. Our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction.

Unlike many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not
provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the United States. While Cayman Islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, which are commonly referred to
in the Cayman Islands as a “scheme of arrangement,” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a
merger in the United States. Under Cayman Islands law and practice, a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent Cayman Islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders
who are present and voting (either in person or by proxy) at such meeting. The shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75% of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders (excluding the shares
owned by the parties to the scheme of



arrangement) present and voting at the meeting. The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the
amalgamation. Although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement, the Grand Court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their
liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the Grand Court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that:

•

the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with;

•

the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;

•

the scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve; and

•

the scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law.

Enforcement of Civil Liabilities—Holders of our common shares may
have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands.

Because we are a Cayman Islands exempted company, there is uncertainty as to whether the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands would recognize or enforce
judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in the Cayman Islands against us
predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.



ITEM 7A.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio
and long-term debt. We currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio, or to hedge debt.

We invest in high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our policy, we are averse to
principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.

We mitigate default risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio and by investing in only high quality securities. We constantly monitor our investment
portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository. We maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary
or resale markets.

We have both fixed and floating rate debt
obligations. We enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs. We have used derivative financial instruments in the form of an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a
portion of our floating rate debt obligations. Our last interest rate swap agreement matured in November 2002. We currently have no swap agreements.

The table below presents principal (or notional) amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and
debt obligations as of July 2, 2004. All investments mature in three years or less.

Foreign Currency
Exchange Risk.

We transact business in various foreign countries. Our primary foreign currency cash flows are in emerging market countries in Asia and in European countries. During the first three fiscal quarters of 2004,
all foreign currency cash flow requirements were met using spot foreign exchange transactions. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, we instituted a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the increase in value of foreign currency cash
flows resulting from expenses over the next year. We hedge portions of our forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward exchange contracts. When the U.S. dollar weakens significantly against the foreign currencies, the increase
in the value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, as



the U.S. dollar strengthens, the decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the value of the forward contracts. The
table below provides information as of July 2, 2004 about our derivative financial instruments, comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The table is provided in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts (at
the contract exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates.

SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

—In
August 2000, Seagate Technology, which was then known as Seagate Technology Holdings and is referred to herein as “the Company,” was formed to be a holding company for the rigid disc drive operating business and the storage area networks
operating business of Seagate Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which is referred to herein as “Seagate Delaware.” In November 2002, the Company sold XIOtech Corporation, its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary that operated the
Company’s storage area networks operating business, to New SAC. See Note 10, Sale of XIOtech Corporation.

In December 2002, the Company completed the initial public offering of 72,500,000 of its common shares, 24,000,000 of which were sold by the Company and
48,500,000 of which were sold by New SAC, as selling shareholder, at a price of $12 per share. Immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering, the Company’s then-outstanding 400 million preferred shares owned by New SAC were
converted into common shares on a one-to-one basis. The Company’s common shares began trading on December 11, 2002. In July 2003, the Company completed the secondary offering of 69,000,000 of its common shares, all of which were sold by New
SAC, as selling shareholder, at a price of $18.75 per share. As of July 2, 2004, New SAC owned 282,500,000 common shares of the Company, or approximately 61.5% of total outstanding common shares.

The Company designs, manufactures and markets products for storage, retrieval
and management of data on computer and data communications systems. The Company sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) for inclusion in their computer systems or subsystems, and to distributors who typically sell to
small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and other resellers.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

The Company establishes certain distributor and OEM sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. These programs are typically related to a
distributor’s level of sales, order size, advertising or point of sale activity or an OEM’s level of sale activity or agreed upon rebate programs. The Company provides for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on
estimated requirements. These estimates are based on various factors, including estimated future price erosion, distributor sell-through levels, program participation, customer claim submittals and sales returns. Significant actual variations in any
of these factors could have a material effect on the Company’s operating results. In addition, our failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.

The Company’s
warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates, trends and estimated repair or replacement costs. The Company uses a statistical model to help with its estimates and the Company exercises considerable judgment in determining the
underlying estimates. Should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from its estimates, or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past, the Company’s future results of
operations could be materially affected. The actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company if the actual rate of unit failure or the cost to repair a unit is greater than that which the
Company has used in estimating the warranty expense accrual.

The Company’s recording of deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on the Company’s ability to generate current and future taxable income in the United States. Each period the Company evaluates the need for a valuation
allowance for the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax

assets are recorded only to the extent the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.

The Company also has other key accounting policies and accounting estimates
relating to uncollectible customer accounts and valuation of inventory. The Company believes that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult
or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on its reported results of operations for a given period.

Basis of Consolidation

—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned subsidiaries, after
eliminations of intercompany transactions and balances.

The
Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30. Accordingly, fiscal year 2004 comprised 53 weeks and ended on July 2, 2004. Fiscal years 2003 and 2002 each comprised 52 weeks
and ended on June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, respectively. All references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2005 will be 52 weeks and will end on July 1, 2005.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation

—The
U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company’s foreign operations. Gains and losses on the remeasurement into U.S. dollars of amounts denominated in foreign currencies are included in net income (loss) for those operations whose
functional currency is the U.S. dollar and translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income (loss) and as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ equity, for those operations whose
functional currency is the local currency.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

—The Company applies the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) and SFAS
No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (“SFAS 149”). Both standards require that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for
designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships.

Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances, and Sales Incentive Programs

—The Company’s revenue recognition policy complies with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101/104, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.” Revenue from sales of products, including sales to distribution customers, is recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the buyer, which generally occurs upon shipment from the Company or third party warehouse
facilities, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, including a fixed price to the buyer, and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Estimated product returns are provided in accordance with SFAS No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When
Right of Return Exists.” The Company also adheres to the requirements of EITF 01-09 “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer,” (“EITF 01-09”) for sales incentive programs. The Company follows

FTP
90-1

“Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance contracts” for sales of extended warranties.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company’s North American distribution customers transitioned from a consignment model, under which the
Company recognized revenue when distributors sold the Company’s products to their customers, to a sell-in model, under which the Company recognizes revenue when its products are sold to distributors. During fiscal year 2002, this transition
resulted in a one-time increase in total revenue, operating income and net income of approximately 1%, 3% and 7%, respectively.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Estimated reductions to revenue for sales incentive programs, such as price protection, and sales
growth bonuses, are recorded when revenue is recorded. Marketing development programs are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense depending on the contractual nature of the program and whether the conditions
of EITF 01-09 have been met.

Product
Warranty

—Enterprise products that are used in large scale servers and data warehousing systems are warranted for three to five years while personal storage products used in consumer and commercial desktop systems are warranted for one to
three years. A provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is recorded when revenue is recorded and is included in cost of revenue. The Company offers extended warranties on certain of its products. Deferred revenue in relation
to extended warranties has not been material to date. Shipping and handling costs are also included in cost of revenue.

Inventory

—Inventories are valued at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost using the first-in, first-out method) or
market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated cost of completion and disposal.

Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements

—Land, equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Equipment and
buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the remaining term of
the lease.

Advertising Expense

—The cost of
advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $25 million, $28 million and $29 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APBO”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APBO 25”), and related interpretations.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

—In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 except for the provisions that were cleared by the FASB in
prior pronouncements. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,”
(“SFAS 150”). This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In accordance with the
standard, financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and was effective in the
Company’s fiscal quarter ended October 3, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FASB Statement No. 132, “Employers disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits,” (“SFAS 132-R”). This statement establishes standards that require companies to provide more details about their plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and other relevant information. In
addition to expanded annual disclosures, companies are required to report the various



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003,
and was effective for the Company’s fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2004. Because the revisions only effect disclosure requirements, the adoption of SFAS 132-R did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

—The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company’s short-term investments are
primarily comprised of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase. The Company has classified its entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are
classified as cash equivalents or short-term investments and are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders’ equity. The amortized cost of debt
securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense). The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method.

Strategic Investments

—The Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives and typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks on these
investments. Both marketable and non-marketable investments are included in other assets. Non-marketable investments are recorded at cost and are periodically analyzed to determine whether or not there are indicators of impairment. The
Company’s results of operations for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 included write-downs of $2 million and $10 million, respectively, in an investment in a private company.

Concentration of Credit Risk

—The Company’s customer base for disc drive products is concentrated with a
small number of OEMs and distributors. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily accounts receivable, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The allowance for noncollection of accounts receivable is based upon the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The
Company places its cash equivalents and short-term investments in investment-grade, short-term debt instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one commercial issuer.

Supplier Concentration

—Certain of the raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are
available from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential materials due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. If the Company were unable to procure certain of such materials, it would be
required to reduce its manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations.

Earnings Per Share

In accordance with SFAS 128, “Earnings per Share,” the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share
for the fiscal years ended July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003 (in millions, except per share data):

Options to purchase
3.7 million, 0.5 million and 10.8 million shares of common stock were outstanding during fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the options’ exercise
price was greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.

Pro Forma Effects of Stock-Based Compensation on Earnings Per Share

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”).
SFAS 148 amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” (“SFAS 123”) to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS 123’s fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148
also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 and APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with
respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company continues to use the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting method provided under SFAS 123 requires the use of option valuation models, such as the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model used by the Company, that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. The pro forma information under SFAS123, as amended by SFAS
148, is as follows (in millions, except per share data):

No tax effects were
included in the determination of pro forma net income because the deferred tax asset resulting from stock-based employee compensation would be offset by an additional valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The effects on pro forma disclosures
of applying SFAS 123 may not be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures in future periods because the Company only began granting options to employees in July 2001. See Note 3, Compensation—Stock-Based Benefit Plans, for a
discussion of the Company’s assumptions used to estimate stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123.

Consummation of Secondary Public Offering

Under the Seagate Technology shareholders agreement among New SAC, the Company’s financial sponsors and the Company, New SAC has demand registration rights to request from time to time that the Company register
to sell shares of its common stock held by New SAC. New SAC exercised this right and, on July 30, 2003, the Company completed the secondary public offering of 69,000,000 of its common shares, of which 9,000,000 were sold pursuant to the
underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option, all of which were sold by New SAC, as selling shareholder, at a price of $18.75 per share. New SAC received proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions of approximately $39 million. The Company incurred direct expenses aggregating approximately $1 million related to the offering. New SAC distributed its net proceeds to holders of its ordinary shares including approximately $245
million distributed to the Company’s officers and employees who hold ordinary shares of New SAC.

Financial Instruments

The following is a summary of the fair value of available-for-sale securities at July 2, 2004:

The following is a
summary of the fair value of available-for-sale securities at June 27, 2003:

The fair value of the
Company’s investment in debt securities, by contractual maturity, is as follows:

Fair Value
Disclosures

—The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. The fair values of short-term investments, notes, marketable equity securities, debentures and interest rate swap agreements are estimated based on quoted
market prices.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The carrying values and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

(1)

Carrying amount and estimated fair value approximated $0.1 million in fiscal year 2004. There were no foreign currency option contracts in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, and no foreign
currency forward exchange contracts in fiscal year 2003.

Derivative Financial Instruments

—The Company may enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments, certain foreign currency denominated balance
sheet positions and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. The Company’s policy prohibits it from entering into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company did not
enter into any fair value hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, the Company instituted a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the increase in value of foreign currency cash flows resulting from expenses over the next fiscal
year. The Company hedges portions of its forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward exchange contracts. When the U.S. dollar weakens significantly against the foreign currencies, the increase in value of the future foreign
currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the forward exchange contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthens, the decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the value
of the forward exchange contracts. As at July 2, 2004, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding currency contracts was approximately $20 million in Singapore dollars and $27 million in Thai baht. The Company did not have any foreign
currency forward exchange or purchased currency option contracts during fiscal years 2003 and 2002.

The Company has both fixed and floating rate debt obligations. The Company enters into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including
capital expenditures and working capital needs. The Company has used derivative financial instruments in the form of an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt obligations. The Company’s last interest rate swap
agreement matured in November 2002, and it currently has no swap agreements.

The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and its primary foreign currency cash flows are in emerging market countries in Asia and in some European countries. Net foreign currency transaction gains
and losses included in the determination of net income (loss) were a gain of $1 million for fiscal year 2004, a gain of $1 million for fiscal year 2003, and a loss of $8 million for fiscal year 2002, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Equipment and leasehold improvements include assets under capitalized leases. Amortization of
leasehold improvements is included in depreciation expense. Depreciation expense was $416 million, $390 million, and $320 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Intangibles

Other intangible assets consist of licensed technology. Amortization of purchased intangibles is provided on a straight-line basis over the respective
useful lives of the assets of 60 months. Accumulated amortization of intangibles was $4 million and $3 million at July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003, respectively.

Supplemental Cash Flow Information

The components of depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:

Long-Term Debt and Credit
Facilities

In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002, the
Company and its subsidiaries completed a refinancing of all its outstanding debt obligations. The refinancing was completed when the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings (“HDD”) and Seagate Technology
(US) Holdings, Inc., entered into new senior secured credit facilities with a group of banks that permit up to $500 million of borrowings consisting of a $150 million revolving credit and a five-year $350 million, LIBOR + 2% term loan facility that
was drawn in full as part of the refinancing. At the same time, HDD issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 8% senior notes due 2009. In addition, Seagate Technology International (“STI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HDD,
initiated a tender offer to purchase its outstanding 12


/


% senior subordinated notes due 2007. All of the


/


% senior subordinated notes were paid. In addition, STI and Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. repaid
the remaining balance outstanding of $679 million, including accrued interest, on its Term A and Term B bank loans.

Neither the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities nor the indenture governing the outstanding 8% senior notes due 2009
impose any restrictions on the ability of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds to HDD, a co-borrower under the new senior secured credit facilities and the issuer of the outstanding notes, in the form of dividends, loans or
advances. The new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a first priority pledge of substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of HDD and many of its subsidiaries. In addition, Seagate Technology and many of its direct and
indirect subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations under the new senior secured credit facilities.

As a result of the refinancing, $93 million was charged to operations in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002. The $93 million charge was comprised of a $50
million redemption premium on the 12

% senior subordinated notes, $31 million write-off of capitalized debt
issue costs related to the prior senior debt obligations (Term A and Term B loans) and the 12 ½% senior subordinated notes, $7 million write off of unamortized discount on the



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

12½% senior subordinated notes, a $4 million loss on the interest rate swap related to one of the term loans comprising the former senior credit
facilities and $1 million of other costs and expenses.

Long-term debt consisted of the following:

At July 2, 2004,
future minimum principal payments on long-term debt were as follows:

As of July 2, 2004,
the Company had $37 million of outstanding standby letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees issued under its $150 million revolving credit facility.

The Company is restricted in its ability to pay distributions to its shareholders by the covenants contained in the indenture governing its senior notes
and the credit agreement governing its senior secured credit facilities. The covenants contained in the indenture governing the Company’s senior notes limit the aggregate amount of restricted payments, including distributions to shareholders,
to 50% of cumulative consolidated net income plus 100% of net cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital for the period beginning June 30, 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements are internally
available. Currently, the most significant restriction on the Company’s ability to pay dividends is under the credit agreement governing the Company’s senior secured credit facilities, which limits annual distributions to $150 million. The
Company’s declaration of distributions is also subject to Cayman Islands law and the discretion of its board of directors.

3.  Compensation

Tax-Deferred Savings Plan

The Company has a tax-deferred savings plan, the Seagate 401(k) Plan (“the 40l(k) plan”), for the benefit of qualified employees. The 40l(k)
plan is designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds at retirement. Qualified employees may elect to make contributions to the 401(k) plan on a monthly basis. The Company may make annual contributions at the discretion of its board of
directors. During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company made contributions of $14 million, $15 million and $13 million, respectively.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Stock-Based Benefit Plans

Share Option Plan

—In December 2000, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Seagate Technology 2001
Share Option Plan (the “Seagate Technology Option Plan”). Under the terms of the Seagate Technology Option Plan, eligible employees, directors, and consultants can be awarded options to purchase common shares of the Company under vesting
terms to be determined at the date of grant. In January 2002, the Seagate Technology Option Plan was amended to increase the maximum number of common shares issuable under the Seagate Technology Option Plan from 72 million to 100 million. No options
to purchase the Company’s common shares had been issued through June 29, 2001. From July 1, 2001 through July 2, 2004, options to purchase 90,985,690 common shares were granted to employees under this share option plan, net of cancellations.
Options granted to exempt employees will generally vest as follows: 25% of the shares will vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% will vest proportionately each month over the next 36 months. Options
granted to non-exempt employees will vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date. Options granted under the Seagate Technology Option Plan were granted at fair market value and expire ten years from the date of grant. The
following is a summary of stock option activity for the Seagate Technology Option Plan:

Options exercisable at
the end of fiscal year 2004 were approximately 29,085,700 at a weighted average exercise price of $3.56. Options exercisable at the end of fiscal year 2003 were approximately 26,545,585 at a weighted average exercise price of $2.49. Options
exercisable at the end of fiscal year 2002 were approximately 23,154,473 at a weighted average exercise price of $2.30.

Deferred Stock Compensation

—In connection with certain stock options granted in fiscal year 2003, the Company recorded deferred stock
compensation totaling $10.7 million, representing the difference between the exercise price of the options and the deemed fair value of the Company’s common shares on the dates the options were granted. This deferred stock compensation is being
amortized over the vesting periods of the underlying stock options of 48 months. Through July 2, 2004, the Company has amortized approximately $5 million of such compensation expense.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Stock Purchase Plan

—The Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP
plan”) in December 2002. A total of 20,000,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under the ESPP plan, plus an automatic annual increase on the first day of the Company’s fiscal year beginning in 2003 equal to the
lesser of 2,500,000 shares or 0.5% of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or such lesser number of shares as is determined by the Company’s board of directors. In no event shall the total number of
shares issued under the ESPP plan exceed 75,000,000 shares. The ESPP plan permits eligible employees who have completed thirty days of employment prior to the commencement of any offering period to purchase common stock through payroll deductions
generally at 85% of the fair market value of the common stock. The ESPP plan has two six-month purchase periods and contains a “rollover” feature if the market price of the stock at the end of any six-month purchase period is lower than
the stock price at the beginning of the offering period. In that case, the plan is immediately canceled after that purchase date, and a new one-year plan is established using the then-current stock price as the base purchase price.

On July 31, 2003, the purchase date for the ESPP’s first purchase
period, a total of 2,496,495 shares of the Company’s common stock were issued. The weighted average exercise price for these shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding rights pursuant to the ESPP was $10.20 per share. On January 30, 2004,
the purchase date for the ESPP’s second purchase period, a total of 2,483,371 shares of the Company’s common stock were issued. The weighted average exercise price for these shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding rights pursuant to
the ESPP was $10.37 per share.

Assumptions Used in
Determining Pro Forma Information

—See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for pro forma information on net income and earnings per share required under SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148.

Up until the Company’s initial public offering of its common stock in
December 2002, the fair value of the Company’s stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method with minimum volatility. For all employee stock options issued subsequent to December 11, 2002, the Company estimated the fair
value of stock options issued to employees using the Black-Scholes valuation method with a volatility factor based on the stock volatilities of its largest publicly traded competitors.

The following table summarizes information about options outstanding at July 2, 2004 (shares in millions).



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The fair value of the Company’s stock options granted to employees during fiscal years 2004 and
2003 was estimated using the following weighted average assumptions:

Deferred Compensation Plan

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted a deferred
compensation plan for the benefit of eligible employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions, in excess of the tax limits applicable to the 401(k) plan and to permit employee deferrals in excess of certain
tax limits. Company assets earmarked to pay benefits under the plan are held by a rabbi trust. The Company has adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97-14, “Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where
Amounts Earned are Held in a Rabbi Trust” (“EITF 97-14”). Under EITF 97-14, the assets and liabilities of a rabbi trust must be accounted for as if they are assets and liabilities of the Company. In addition all earnings and expenses
of the rabbi trust are recorded as other income or expense in the Company’s financial statements. At July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003, the deferred compensation amounts related to the rabbi trust were approximately $61 million and $42 million,
respectively, and are included in current liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets.

Post-Retirement Medical Plan

In fiscal year 2000, Seagate Delaware adopted a post-retirement medical plan that offers medical coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents. Substantially all U.S. employees become eligible for these benefits after 15
years of service and attaining age 60 and older. The Company’s measurement date is March 31

st

of each year.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the post-retirement medical
plan’s benefit obligation and a statement of the funded status as of July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003:

Net periodic benefit
cost for the fiscal years ended July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003 was as follows:

Weighted-Average
Actuarial Assumptions:

A discount rate of 5.75% was used
in the determination of the accumulated benefit obligation.

The Company’s future medical benefit costs were estimated to increase at an annual rate of 11% during 2004, decreasing to an annual growth rate of 5% in 2010 and thereafter. The Company’s cost was capped at 200% of the fiscal year
1999 employer cost and, therefore, was not subject to medical and dental trends after the capped cost was attained. A 1% change in these annual trend rates would not have a significant impact on the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation at
July 2, 2004, or the 2004 benefit expense. Claims are paid as incurred.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Company discontinued subsidizing its post-retirement medical plan for new retirees subsequent to July 2, 2004. As a result, the benefit obligation accrued to date for current company employees
will be eliminated and the Company estimates that it will record a reduction in operating expenses of approximately $18 million in its first fiscal quarter of 2005 related to this reduction in the benefit obligation.

4.  Income Taxes

Certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company are included in certain unitary and
combined U.S. state tax returns with certain U.S. affiliates of New SAC and have entered into a tax sharing agreement effective November 23, 2000. Pursuant to the terms of the state tax sharing agreement (“State Tax Allocation Agreement”),
hypothetical U.S. state tax returns (with certain modifications) are calculated as if the U.S. subsidiaries of the Company were filing on a separate return basis. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are required to reimburse participating New

SAC U.S. affiliates to the extent the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries utilize the tax attributes of these U.S. affiliates of New SAC to reduce their
separately computed income tax liabilities within 30 days of the close of the fiscal year such affiliates would have otherwise been able to utilize their own tax attributes. If New SAC’s participating U.S. affiliates utilize tax attributes of
the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries, the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries will be reimbursed for those tax attributes within 30 days of the close of the fiscal year during which the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries would have otherwise been able to
utilize the tax attributes to reduce their separately computed tax liabilities. As of July 2, 2004, there were no outstanding balances for taxes due to or from any New SAC affiliates.

The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following:

Company had recorded $58 million of deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the Company generating sufficient U.S. taxable income in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Although realization is not assured,
the Company’s management believes that it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease, when the Company reevaluates the
underlying basis for its estimates of future U.S. and certain foreign taxable income.

In fiscal year 2004, the valuation allowance increased by $125 million. In fiscal years 2003 and 2002, the valuation allowance decreased by $70 million and $20 million, respectively. Approximately $125 million of the
valuation allowance as of July 2, 2004 was attributable to the U.S. income tax benefits of stock option deductions, the benefit of which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when, and if, realized.

At July 2, 2004, the Company had U.S. and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $433 million and $124 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2005, if not utilized. At July 2, 2004, the Company had U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $74 million, which will expire
at various dates beginning in 2006, if not utilized.

Utilization of the U.S. net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state
provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss or tax credit carry-forwards before utilization.

The applicable statutory rate in the Cayman Islands was zero for Seagate Technology for fiscal years
ended July 2, 2004, June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002. For purposes of the reconciliation between the provision for (benefit from) income taxes at the statutory rate and the effective tax rate, a notional U.S. 35% rate is applied as follows:

A substantial portion
of the Company’s Asia Pacific manufacturing operations in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand operate under various tax holidays and tax incentive programs, which expire in whole or in part during fiscal years 2005 through 2015. Certain of
the tax holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net impact of these tax holidays and tax incentive programs was to increase the Company’s net income by approximately $89 million in fiscal year 2004 ($0.18 per share,
diluted), to increase the Company’s net income by approximately $89 million ($0.19 per share, diluted) in fiscal year 2003, and to increase the Company’s net income by approximately $74 million ($0.17 per share, diluted) in fiscal year
2002.

As a result of the purchase of the operating assets of
Seagate Delaware and the ensuing corporate structure, the Company now consists of a foreign parent holding company with various foreign and U.S. subsidiaries. Dividend distributions received from the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries may be subject
to U.S. withholding taxes when, and if, distributed. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the Cayman Islands or U.S.
federal income tax if remitted to the foreign parent holding company.

On July 31, 2001, Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service filed a settlement stipulation with the United States Tax Court in complete settlement of the remaining disputed tax matter reflected in the statutory notice of deficiency
dated June 12, 1998. The settlement stipulation was expressly contingent upon Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service entering into a closing agreement in connection with certain tax matters arising in all or some part of the open tax
years of Seagate Delaware and New SAC. The Internal Revenue Service completed its review of Seagate Delaware’s federal tax returns for the periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets and submitted its conclusions to the
congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for review. On March 15, 2004, VERITAS Software Corporation (“VERITAS”) received written notification from the Internal Revenue Service that the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation had
completed its review and had taken no exception to the Internal Revenue Service’s conclusions. On April 6, 2004, Seagate Delaware and the Internal Revenue Service filed a revised settlement stipulation with the United States Tax Court in
connection with the statutory notice of deficiency which reflected the parties’ agreement to fully resolve the remaining tax matters included in the statutory notice of deficiency. On June 28, 2004, the revised settlement stipulation was made
final by the United States Tax Court and the case has been closed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In the fiscal year ended July 2, 2004, the Company recorded a $125 million income tax benefit from
the reversal of accrued income taxes relating to tax indemnification amounts due to VERITAS pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement between Seagate Delaware, New SAC and VERITAS. The $125 million tax indemnification amount had been recorded by the
Company in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware and represented U.S. tax liabilities previously accrued by Seagate Delaware for periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets. As a result of the
conclusion of the tax audits with no additional tax liabilities due, the Company determined that the $125 million accrual for the tax indemnification was no longer required and it was reversed in the third fiscal quarter of 2004.

Certain of Seagate Delaware’s foreign and state tax returns remain under
examination by various taxing authorities. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in 2001 and 2002. The timing of the settlement of these examinations is uncertain.
We believe that adequate amounts of tax have been provided for any final assessment that may result.

5. Restructuring Costs

During fiscal year 2004, the Company recorded $59 million in restructuring charges. Of the $59 million, $39 million was incurred in the quarter ended July 2, 2004 and was associated with the Company’s planned workforce reduction first
announced in April 2004 and implemented in June 2004. The $39 million restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a workforce reduction, primarily in its U.S. and Far East operations, of approximately 2,407
employees, 1,626 of whom had been terminated as of July 2, 2004. The Company expects the restructuring activities related to the charge taken in its fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 to be substantially completed by August 2004.

The remaining $20 million in restructuring charges were incurred through the
nine months ended April 2, 2004 and a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of the Company’s global workforce with existing and anticipated future market requirements, primarily in its U.S. design centers and Far
East operations. The restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs relating to a reduction in the Company’s workforce of approximately 649 employees, 626 of whom had been terminated as of July 2, 2004. These restructuring
activities were substantially complete at July 2, 2004.

During
fiscal year 2003, the Company recorded $19 million in restructuring charges. The Company also reduced a restructuring accrual previously recorded by its predecessor in fiscal year 1998 by $10 million due to a change in estimated lease obligations.
These combined actions resulted in a net restructuring charge of $9 million for fiscal year 2003.

Of the $19 million of restructuring charges the Company recorded in fiscal year 2003, $17 million was incurred in the fiscal quarter ended September 27,
2002 as a result of a restructuring plan, which the Company refers to as the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan, established to continue the alignment of the Company’s global workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated
future market requirements, primarily in its Far East operations. The restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a reduction in its workforce of approximately 3,750 employees. The fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan
was substantially complete at June 27, 2003. The remaining $2 million restructuring charge was incurred in the fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2003 and was comprised of employee termination costs relating to a workforce reduction of approximately 686
employees in the Company’s Thailand operations. These restructuring activities were completed in July 2003.

During fiscal year 2002, the Company recorded $13 million in restructuring charges and reversed $9 million of restructuring charges recorded in prior
fiscal years resulting in a net restructuring charge of $4 million. The



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

restructuring plan implemented in fiscal year 2002 (the “fiscal year 2002 restructuring plan”) was established to align the Company’s global
workforce and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market requirements, primarily in its IT operations and in its Far East operations in China. The restructuring charges were comprised of $10 million for employee termination
costs, $2 million for contract cancellations and $1 million for the write-off of excess manufacturing equipment. The fiscal year 2002 restructuring plan was substantially complete prior to the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2003.

The following table summarizes the Company’s
restructuring activities for fiscal years ended July 2, 2004, June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002:

6.  Business Segment and
Geographic Information

Prior to the Company’s sale
of XIOtech Corporation to New SAC on November 4, 2002, the Company had two operating segments: rigid disc drives and storage area networks, however, only the rigid disc drive business was a reportable segment. See Note 10, Sale of XIOtech
Corporation. The operating results for XIOtech are included in the Company’s consolidated results of operations through the date that XIOtech was sold to New SAC in November 2002 and are included in the “other” category below. The
Company has identified its Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, as the Chief Operating Decision Maker. Gross profit from operations is defined as revenue less cost of revenue.

In each of fiscal years 2004 and 2003, Hewlett-Packard Corporation accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue. In
fiscal year 2002, on a combined basis Compaq Computer Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Corporation (Hewlett-Packard Corporation acquired Compaq Computer Corporation in May 2002) accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue. No other customer
accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues in any year presented.

Long-lived assets consist of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, capital leases, equity investments, goodwill and other intangibles, and other non-current assets as recorded by the Company’s
operations in each area.

7.  Equity

Share Capital

The Company’s authorized share capital is $13,500 and consists of 1,250,000,000 common shares, par value $0.00001, of which 459,595,663 shares were
outstanding as of July 2, 2004 and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00001, of which none were issued or outstanding as of July 2, 2004.

Common shares

—Holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends and distributions when and as declared by the Company’s board of
directors (the “Board of Directors”). Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after required payments are made to holders of preferred shares, any remaining assets of the Company will be distributed ratably to
holders of the preferred and common shares. Holders of shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which the common shares are entitled to vote, including the election of directors.

Preferred shares

—The Company is authorized to issue up to a total
of 100 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, without stockholder approval. The Board of Directors is authorized to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the rights, preferences
and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. The Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that
series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred
stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company and might harm the market
price of its common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. As of July 2, 2004, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

Distributions

During fiscal year 2004, pursuant to its quarterly dividend policy, the Company made cash distributions to its shareholders aggregating approximately $90
million, or $0.20 per share. Of the $90 million paid, New SAC received approximately $57 million. New SAC in turn distributed the $57 million it received to its ordinary shareholders, including approximately $11 million paid to officers and
employees of the Company who held ordinary shares of New SAC (see Note 13, Related Party Transactions—Distributions to New SAC).

8. Commitments

Leases

—The Company leases certain property, facilities and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements. Land and facility leases expire at
various dates through 2027 and contain various provisions for rental adjustments including, in certain cases, a provision based on increases in the Consumer Price Index. All of the leases require the Company to pay property taxes, insurance and
normal maintenance costs.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Future minimum lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or
more were as follows at July 2, 2004 (lease payments are shown net of sublease income):

Total rent expense for
all land, facility and equipment operating leases was approximately $23 million, $24 million and $23 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total sublease rental income for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $6 million, $8
million and $8 million, respectively. The Company subleases a portion of its facilities that it considers to be in excess of current requirements. Total future lease income to be recognized for the Company’s existing subleases is approximately
$16 million.

Capital Expenditures

—The
Company’s commitments for construction of manufacturing facilities and equipment approximated $176 million at July 2, 2004.

9.  Legal, Environmental, and Other Contingencies

Intellectual Property Litigation

Convolve, Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) v. Seagate Technology LLC, et al.

Between
1998 and 1999, Convolve, Inc., a small privately held technology consulting firm founded by an MIT Ph.D., engaged in discussions with Seagate Delaware with respect to the potential license of technology that Convolve claimed to own. During that
period, the parties entered into non-disclosure agreements. The Company declined Convolve’s offer of a license in late 1999. On July 13, 2000, Convolve and MIT filed suit against Compaq Computer Corporation and the Company in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging patent infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and fraud relating to Convolve and MIT’s Input Shaping

technology. The plaintiffs claim their technology is incorporated in Seagate’s sound barrier technology, which was publicly announced on June 6, 2000.
The complaint seeks injunctive relief, $800 million in compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages. The Company answered the complaint on August 2, 2000 and filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment that two Convolve/MIT patents are
invalid and not infringed and that it owns any intellectual property based on the information that the Company disclosed to Convolve. The court denied plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery and ordered plaintiffs to identify their trade
secrets to defendants before discovery could begin. Convolve served a trade secrets disclosure on August 4, 2000, and the Company filed a motion challenging the disclosure statement. On May 3, 2001, the court appointed a special master to review the
trade secret issues. The special master resigned on June 5, 2001, and the court appointed another special master on July 26, 2001. After a hearing on the Company’s motion challenging the trade secrets disclosure on September 21, 2001, the
special master issued a report and recommendation to the court that the trade secret list was insufficient. Convolve revised the trade secret list, and the court entered an order on January 1, 2002, accepting the special master’s
recommendation that this trade secret list was adequate. On November 6, 2001, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued U.S. Patent No. 6,314,473 to



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Convolve. Convolve filed an amended complaint on January 16, 2002, alleging defendants’ infringement of this patent, and the Company answered and filed
counterclaims on February 8, 2002. Discovery is in process. On July 26, 2002, the Company filed a Rule 11 motion challenging the adequacy of plaintiffs’ pre-filing investigation on the first two patents alleged in the complaint and seeking
dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims related to these patents and reimbursement of attorney’s fees. The court denied the Company’s motion on May 23, 2003. Briefing on claims construction issues has been completed and a claims construction
(Markman) hearing has been requested. No trial date has been set. The Company believes that the claims are without merit, and it intends to defend against them vigorously. On May 6, 2003, the USPTO issued to Convolve U.S. Patent No. 6,560,658 B2,
entitled “Data Storage Device with Quick and Quiet Modes.” Convolve has indicated that it will seek leave of the court to add this patent to the lawsuit. This latest patent is a continuation of a patent currently in the lawsuit (U.S.
Patent No. 6,314,473). The Company similarly believes any claims that may relate to this continuation patent would be without merit, regardless of whether such claims were added to the ongoing litigation or asserted against the Company in a separate
lawsuit. Judge John Martin, who was assigned to this case, has announced his retirement from the federal bench. The case was reassigned to Judge George B. Daniels. On October 14, 2003, the Special Master resigned from the case due to Convolve’s
claim that he had a conflict of interest. Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV was appointed to handle all discovery matters. Plaintiffs have indicated that they will dismiss claims regarding U.S. Patent No. 5,638,267 from the case. The claims
construction hearing on U.S. Patent Nos. 4,916,635 and 6,314,473 was held on March 30 and 31, 2004. The Company awaits the court’s order.

Shao Tong, et al. v. Seagate International (Wuxi) Co., Ltd

.    In July 2002, the Company was sued in the People’s Court of
Nanjing City, China, by an individual, Shao Tong, and a private Chinese company, Nanjing Yisike Network Safety Technique Co., Ltd. The complaint alleged that two of the Company’s personal storage disc drive products infringe Chinese patent
number ZL94111461.9, which prevents the corruption of systems data stored on rigid disc drives. The suit, which sought to stop the Company from manufacturing the two products and claimed immaterial monetary damages, was dismissed by the court on
procedural grounds on November 29, 2002. On December 3, 2002, the plaintiffs served the Company with notice that they had refiled the lawsuit. The new complaint contained identical infringement claims against the same disc drive products, claimed
immaterial monetary damages and attorney’s fees and requested injunctive relief and a recall of the products from the Chinese market. Manufacture of the accused products ceased in May 2003. At a hearing on March 10, 2003, the court referred the
matter to an independent technical advisory board for a report on the application of the patent claims to the two products. On June 10, 2003, the Company presented its non-infringement case to the technical panel. The panel issued a technical
advisory report to the court finding no infringement. The court heard oral arguments on the technical advisory report in September 2003, issued an order that Seagate products did not infringe the patent and rejected plaintiffs’ lawsuit.
Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Jiangsu High Court, and the Company filed its opposition brief on January 21, 2004. The People’s Republic of China Patent Reexamination Board (the “PRB”) declared patent ZL94111461.9 invalid on
March 28, 2004. The patentee has three months to appeal the PRB’s decision. The Jiangsu High Court stayed the appeal on the infringement case pending a final judgment on patent invalidity. On June 22, 2004, Shao Tong filed a lawsuit in the
Beijing Intermediate People’s Court against the PRB challenging its patent invalidity decision. The Company believes the claims are without merit, and intends to defend against them vigorously.

Read-Rite Corporation

. In order to clarify the Company’s rights
under a Patent Cross-License Agreement between Seagate Delaware and Read-Rite Corporation, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action on May 7, 2003 in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, seeking a declaration that it
is entitled to a cross-license, effective as of November 22, 2000, under terms substantially identical to those contained in the Patent Cross License Agreement. On June 11, 2003, Read-Rite Corporation answered the complaint putting forward a general
denial and asserting various affirmative defenses. On June 17, 2003, Read-Rite Corporation filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon notice, the



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company’s declaratory judgment action has been stayed. On July 23, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved Western Digital Corporation’s bid to
acquire the assets of Read-Rite Corporation, including intellectual property that was the subject of Read-Rite’s dispute with the Company, in a transaction that closed on July 31, 2003. The Company objected to Western Digital’s assumption
of the Patent Cross-License Agreement. On November 14, 2003, the Bankruptcy Trustee made a motion to assume or reject certain Read-Rite executory contracts, rejecting the Patent Cross-License Agreement. The Company has given notice of its election
to retain the benefits of the Patent Cross-License Agreement to the extent permitted by Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Securities and Exchange Commission’s Request for Information

In October 2003, the Company received from the SEC a request for all third-party research analyst reports regarding Seagate Technology published during
the period commencing January 1, 2000 through August 30, 2003. By early December 2003 the Company had provided all information requested by the SEC. There are no outstanding requests from the SEC for further information. The additional information
furnished related to the allegations of the former employee who has claimed the Company terminated him in violation of the Minnesota Whistleblower Act. Nothing has come to the Company’s attention during this process that changes its view
regarding the lack of merit of those claims. There is no procedural requirement that the SEC completes any investigation within certain timeframes or makes any announcements with respect to the status of an investigation.

The former employee has alleged that the Company dismissed him because he
asserted that the Company had incorrectly reallocated certain expenses between costs of goods sold and research and development costs in its financial statements. The reallocations, which the Company did record, were related to a broad company
restructuring that changed the focus of activities at various locations as between manufacturing and research and development. These reallocations had no impact on either revenues or earnings and were detailed in the Company’s financial
statements contained in its initial public offering prospectus. Moreover, the Company reviewed the reallocations, as well as its financial statement disclosures regarding them, with its independent auditors and the members of the audit committee of
its board of directors at the time of the Company’s initial public offering in light of the employee’s allegations. Based upon the Company’s review, which included an investigation by independent counsel and independent accountants
reporting to its audit committee, the Company believes that all reallocations were appropriate, the associated disclosure was complete, and that all of the employee’s allegations are without merit.

Environmental Matters

The Company’s operations inside and outside the United States are subject to laws and regulations relating to
protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and clean-up of contaminated sites. Contaminants have been detected at
some of the Company’s former sites, principally in connection with historical operations. In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites. Investigative activities have taken place at all
sites of known contamination. One former site is under a Consent Order by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The extent of the contamination at this site has been investigated and defined and remediation is underway. The Company is
indemnified by a third party for a portion of the costs it may incur in the clean-up of contamination at most sites. In the opinion of management, including internal counsel, the potential losses to the Company in excess of amounts already accrued
arising out of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or overall trends in results of operations, even if joint and several liabilities were to be assessed and if the third party
failed to indemnify the Company.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Other Matters

The Company is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to its business, and it may be involved in various legal
proceedings arising in the normal course of its business in the future. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its
financial position or results of operations.

10.  Sale of XIOtech
Corporation

On November 4, 2002, the Company sold XIOtech
Corporation, the wholly-owned indirect subsidiary that operated the Company’s storage area networks business, to New SAC. New SAC in turn sold 51% of XIOtech to a third party in a transaction in which XIOtech sold newly issued shares to this
third party. As a result, New SAC has retained an interest of less than 20% of XIOtech.

In consideration of the Company’s sale of XIOtech to New SAC, the Company received a $32 million promissory note from New SAC. The amount of this promissory note was equal to the estimated fair value of XIOtech
as of the date of the sale, net of intercompany indebtedness. Immediately after the sale of XIOtech to New SAC, the Company made an in-kind pro rata distribution of the entire promissory note to the holders of its then-outstanding shares, including
New SAC, which at the time owned approximately 99.4% of its outstanding shares. That portion of the note distributed back to New SAC was cancelled, and New SAC immediately paid off the remaining 0.6% of the promissory note held by the Company’s
minority shareholders. As a result of the sale of XIOtech, the Company will no longer consolidate XIOtech’s operations with its operations.

Because New SAC at the time owned approximately 99.4% of the Company’s outstanding shares, the Company’s sale of XIOtech to New SAC was recorded
as a dividend of an amount equal to the net book value of XIOtech of $1 million rather than as a sale for the fair value of the promissory note. As of November 4, 2002, XIOtech’s balance sheet consisted of $33 million of current assets, $6
million of non-current assets, $36 million of current liabilities (which included $19 million of intercompany indebtedness), and $2 million of long-term liabilities.

11.  Guarantees

Intellectual Property Indemnification Obligations

The Company has entered into agreements with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are
customary in the industry. These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions. The nature of the
intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers and suppliers. Historically, the Company has not made any
significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.

Product Warranty

The Company estimates probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its
products for a period of one to five years. The Company uses estimated repair or replacement costs and uses statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine its warranty

obligation. Changes in the Company’s product warranty liability during the fiscal years ended July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003 were as follows:

The Company offers
extended warranties on certain of its products. Deferred revenue in relation to extended warranties has not been material to date.

12.  Related Party Transactions

Affiliate Transactions

Historically, the Company has provided substantial services to other affiliated companies. Upon the closing of the stock purchase agreement by New SAC,
these services continue to be provided by the Company through New SAC. The services provided generally include general management, treasury, tax, financial reporting, benefits administration, insurance, information technology, legal, accounts
payable and receivable and credit functions, among others. The Company charges for these services through corporate expense allocations. The amount of corporate expense allocations depends upon the total amount of allocable costs incurred by the
Company on behalf of the affiliated company less amounts charged as specified cost or expense rather than by allocation. Such costs have been proportionately allocated to the affiliated companies based on detailed inquiries and estimates of time
incurred by the Company’s corporate marketing and general administrative departmental managers. Management believes that the allocations charged to other affiliated companies are reasonable. Allocations charged to other affiliated
companies’ marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $2 million, $4 million and $4 million, respectively. XIOtech Corporation and Certance Holdings (“Certance”) are affiliates of
Seagate Technology. The Company recorded revenue from XIOtech and Certance of $8 million and $3 million in fiscal year 2004, $23 million and $5 million in fiscal year 2003, and $8 million and $7 million in fiscal year 2002, respectively. The amounts
receivable from Xiotech and Certance were $1 million from each at July 2, 2004 and $1 million and $5 million, respectively, at June 27, 2003. Purchases and sales to other affiliated companies were not material for any of the periods presented.

Certain members of our board of directors are also on the
boards of directors of Microsoft Corporation, Flextronics International Ltd., United Parcel Service, Inc., and E2open, Inc. The Company sells disc drives to Microsoft and Flextronics for use in their products. The Company recorded net revenue of
$113 million, $136 million and $124 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for sales to Microsoft and Flextronics. With respect to such sales, at July 2, 2004, the Company had accounts receivable and accounts payable of $23
million and $7 million, respectively, and at June 27, 2003, the Company had accounts receivable and accounts payable of $15 million and $0 million, respectively. The Company made payments to United Parcel Service of $114 million, $120 million and

of our board of directors became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Motorola, Inc. on January 5, 2004. The Company recorded revenue of $16 million from sales to Motorola for the period from January 5, 2004 to July 2, 2004 and had accounts

Employee Receivables

At July 2, 2004, amounts receivable from two officers totaled $0.7 million while amounts from an additional 17 officers and/or employees totaled
$1.2 million. At June 27, 2003, amounts receivable from three officers totaled $1.8 million while amounts receivable from an additional 11 officers and/or employees totaled $0.8 million. Individual loans were made to these employees to
assist them with relocation costs and/or beginning employment at the Company. At July 2, 2004, the loans totaling $0.7 million bear interest at 8% per year and are due in lump sum payments, including unpaid interest, in fiscal year 2006. Under
the terms of these loans, $0.3 million of the $0.7 million, as well as accrued and unpaid interest, will be forgiven if these officers remain employed for a specified period of time. In the periods in which these officers fulfill their
employment obligations, the amount of principal and interest, which are forgiven ratably over the required employment term, will be charged to compensation expense. The loans totaling $1.2 million generally are non-interest bearing and are due
in lump sum payments at the end of a five-year period.

Distributions to New
SAC

During fiscal year 2004, pursuant to its quarterly
dividend policy, the Company made cash distributions to its shareholders aggregating approximately $90 million. Of the $90 million paid, New SAC received approximately $57 million. New SAC in turn distributed the $57 million it received to its
ordinary shareholders, including approximately $11 million paid to officers and employees of the Company who held ordinary shares of New SAC.

In July 2003, the Company completed the secondary public offering of 69,000,000 of its common shares, of which 9,000,000 were sold pursuant to the
underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option, all of which were sold by New SAC, as selling shareholder, at a price of $18.75 per share. New SAC received proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions of approximately $39 million. The Company incurred direct expenses aggregating approximately $1 million related to the offering. New SAC distributed its net proceeds to holders of its ordinary shares including approximately $245
million distributed to the Company’s officers and employees who hold ordinary shares of New SAC.

In February 2003 and May 2003, pursuant to its quarterly dividend policy, the Company made cash distributions to its shareholders aggregating
approximately $26 million. Of the $26 million paid, New SAC received approximately $21 million. New SAC in turn distributed the $21 million it received to its ordinary shareholders, including approximately $5 million paid to officers and employees

quarter ended December 27, 2002. New SAC received proceeds of approximately $557 million from the sale of 48,500,000 common shares in the Company’s initial public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. New SAC
distributed the $557 million net proceeds from the offering and the $259 million return of capital distribution from the Company to its preferred and ordinary shareholders, including a total payment of approximately $38 million to officers and
employees of the Company who held preferred and ordinary shares of New SAC. The distribution by New SAC to its preferred stock holders triggered the requirement by the Company to pay its remaining deferred compensation plan obligation to its
participating officers and employees totaling $147 million, which was paid in December 2002.

On May 20, 2002, the Company made a distribution to its shareholders, including New SAC, to enable New SAC to make a distribution to its preferred shareholders. The aggregate amount of the shareholder distribution was

officers and employees of the Company who held preferred shares of New SAC. The payment of this distribution on preferred shares by New SAC triggered a required payment by the Company under its deferred compensation plan of $32 million that was paid
in May 2002.

On March 19, 2002, the Company paid a
distribution of $33 million to its shareholders, including New SAC, to enable New SAC to make a distribution of approximately $33 million to its shareholders, which allowed members of the Company’s sponsor group to satisfy tax obligations.
Approximately $32 million of this amount was paid to New SAC. New SAC had previously distributed $32 million to its ordinary shareholders, including the distribution of approximately $7 million paid to officers and employees of the Company that held
ordinary shares of New SAC.

13.  Condensed Consolidating
Financial Information

On May 13, 2002, Seagate Technology
HDD Holdings, or HDD, issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 8% senior notes due 2009. HDD is the Company’s wholly-owned direct subsidiary, and the Company has guaranteed HDD’s obligations under the 8% senior notes, on a
joint and several, full and unconditional basis. The following tables present parent guarantor, subsidiary issuer and combined non-guarantors condensed consolidating balance sheets of the Company and its subsidiaries at July 2, 2004 and June 27,
2003 and the condensed consolidating results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended July 2, 2004, June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002. The information classifies the Company’s subsidiaries into Seagate Technology-parent company
guarantor, HDD-subsidiary issuer, and the combined non-guarantors based upon the classification of those subsidiaries under the terms of the 8% senior notes. The Company is restricted in its ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend
or loan under both the indenture governing the 8% senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities. Under each of these instruments, dividends paid by HDD or its restricted subsidiaries would constitute restricted
payments, and loans between the Company and HDD or its restricted subsidiaries would constitute affiliate transactions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Seagate Technology

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Seagate Technology as of July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows of Seagate Technology for the fiscal
years ended July 2, 2004, June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Seagate Technology at July 2, 2004 and June 27, 2003, and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Seagate Technology for the fiscal years ended July 2, 2004, June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.
