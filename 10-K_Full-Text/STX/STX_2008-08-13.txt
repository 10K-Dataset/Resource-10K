PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

We are the world’s leading provider of hard disc drives, based on revenue and units shipped. We design, manufacture, market and sell hard disc
drives. Hard disc drives, commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives, are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters or discs with magnetic surfaces. The performance attributes of disc drives, including their cost
effectiveness and high storage capacities has resulted in disc drives being used as the primary medium for storing electronic data in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers, and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering
electronic data over corporate networks and the Internet.

We
produce a broad range of disc drive products addressing enterprise applications, where our products are used in enterprise servers, mainframes and workstations; desktop applications, where our products are used in desktop computers; mobile computing
applications, where our products are used in notebook computers; and consumer electronics applications, where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs), gaming devices and other consumer electronic
devices that require storage. We also sell our branded storage solutions under both the Seagate and Maxtor brands. In addition to manufacturing and selling disc drives, we provide data storage services for small- to medium-sized businesses,
including online backup, data protection and recovery solutions.

We sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and we also market to distributors under our globally recognized brand names. We have longstanding relationships with many of our OEM customers including
Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP”), Dell Inc. (“Dell”), EMC Corporation (“EMC”), International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) and Lenovo Group Limited (“Lenovo”). For the fiscal years 2008, 2007
and 2006 approximately 67%, 64% and 72%, respectively, of our disc drive revenue was from sales to OEMs. We also have key relationships with major distributors who sell our disc drive products to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and retailers
throughout most of the world. Shipments to distributors were approximately 26%, 30% and 25% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Retail sales of our branded storage products in fiscal year 2008, as a
percentage of our disc drive revenue, were 7%, compared to 6% and 3% in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. For fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately 30% of our disc drive revenue came from customers located in North America,
approximately 27% came from customers located in Europe and approximately 43% came from customers located in the Far East. The only customer exceeding 10% of our disc drive revenue for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 was HP. Dell exceeded 10% of our
disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 and 2006. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.

Industry Overview

Electronic Data Storage Industry

The electronic data storage industry is comprised of companies that provide storage solutions through a variety of technologies such as disc drives, tape
storage, as well as semiconductor-based storage technologies such as flash memory. Participants in the electronic data storage industry include:

Major subcomponent manufacturers.

Companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in electronic data storage
devices or solutions include companies such as TDK Corporation (“TDK”), Fuji Electric Device Technology Co., Ltd. (“Fuji”), and Showa Denko K.K. (“Showa”), that supply heads and media to disc drive manufacturers as well
as semiconductor companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd (“Samsung”), SanDisk Corporation (“SanDisk”), Micron Technology, Inc. (“Micron”), and Intel Corporation (“Intel”), who each manufacture flash
memory.

Hardware storage solutions
manufactures.

Inc. (“Motorola”), Directv Group, Inc., Tivo Inc. and Scientific-Atlanta Inc., a subsidiary of Cisco Systems Inc. company; enterprise storage system OEMs such as HP, EMC and Network Appliance, Inc. (“Net App”); and distributors
who in turn integrate storage hardware and software into end user applications.

Storage services

.    An emerging area within the electronic data storage industry is services and solutions related to the backup, archiving, recovery and discovery of electronic data.

Demand for Electronic Data Storage

The electronic data storage industry has traditionally been focused on
compute applications for the enterprise market. We believe that technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of non-compute applications in the consumer electronics market such as digital video recorders (DVRs), gaming devices,
digital music players and digital cameras is increasingly driving the broad, global proliferation of digital content through the:

•

creation and sharing

of all types of digital content, including digital photos, video, movies and music by consumers and electronic data by enterprises;

•

aggregation and distribution

of digital content through services and other offerings by companies such as YouTube by Google Inc. (“Google”), Flickr
by Yahoo! Inc. (“Yahoo”), iTunes by Apple and MySpace by News Corporation (“News Corp.”);

•

network infrastructure

, including broadband, cable and satellite that has enabled the access, hosting and distribution of such digital content;

•

enjoyment and consumption

of digital content through DVRs, handheld applications, gaming consoles and in automobiles; and

•

protection

of digital content through storage on backup devices and storage services.

We believe that growth in digital content is being driven by: media-rich
content, such as high definition video, digital photos, movies and music; an increase in user generated content, such as online video sharing, blogging and podcasting; the digitization of content previously stored in analog format such as paper
filing systems; the duplication of content in multiple locations, including consumers’ replication of digital photos, video and other media. As a result of these factors, the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly
higher storage capacity in order to store, manage, distribute, utilize and back up such content. This in turn has resulted in the rapid growth in demand for electronic data storage applications and solutions.

We believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and
traditional compute markets continues to grow as increasing legal and regulatory requirements and changes in the nature and amount of data being stored has necessitated additional storage. Additionally, the proliferation of digital content in the
consumer space has resulted in additional demand for storage by enterprises, including those that host, aggregate, distribute or share such content.



Demand for Disc Drives

While the disc drive industry has traditionally been focused on applications for the enterprise and compute markets, we
believe advances in disc drive capacity, cost per gigabyte, power and ruggedness have enabled growth in demand for digital content. These technological advances, as well as a proliferation of non-compute applications in the consumer electronics
market, has increased the demand for disc drives used in consumer electronics applications or has indirectly driven the demand for additional disc drives to store, host or back up related media content created by such applications.

Disc drives are presently the most common storage solution in enterprise,
desktop, mobile and higher capacity consumer electronics applications. We are particularly focused on the following areas of growing demand for disc drives:

Disc Drives for Mobile Computing.

The mobile computing market is growing faster than the market for desktop computers as
price and performance continue to improve. Notebook systems are increasingly becoming the preference for both consumers and enterprises as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance. We estimate that in fiscal year
2008, industry disc drive shipments for mobile compute applications grew approximately 45% from fiscal year 2007.

The disc drive industry has recently seen the introduction of alternative technologies that directly compete with mobile disc drives. For example, certain
manufacturers have introduced SSDs, using flash memory technology, which is an alternative to disc drives in certain applications. Due to the high capital requirements and capacity required to manufacture flash memory, we believe the perceived
benefits of SSDs are not currently realized at an attractive cost relative to hard disc drives, particularly in higher capacity applications. We believe that the market for these alternative technologies is still developing and because of the
current high cost per gigabyte of these storage solutions, we do not expect these solutions to have a significant near-term impact on the overall market for disc drives for mobile computing.

Disc Drives for Enterprise Storage.

The need to
address the expansion in data storage management requirements has spurred the evolution of new storage and data management technologies for both mission critical and business critical enterprise storage.

Mission critical enterprise storage is defined by the use of high
performance, high capacity disc drives for use in applications which are vital to the operation of enterprises. We expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to grow, driven by many enterprises continuing to move network
traffic to dedicated storage area networks (SANs). In addition, many enterprises are moving away from the use of server-attached storage to network-attached storage (NAS). Both of these solutions are comprised principally of high performance, high
capacity disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies. In addition, many enterprises are also consolidating data centers, aiming to increase speed and reliability within a smaller space, reducing network complexity and
increasing energy savings, which has led to an increased demand for more energy efficient, small form factor disc drives. SSD storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disc drives. In
addition, enterprises are considering the use of SSDs in applications where rapid processing is required for high volume transaction data. The timing of the adoption of SSDs in these applications is currently unknown as enterprises weigh the cost
benefits of mission critical enterprise disc drives relative to the perceived performance benefits of SSDs.

Business critical enterprise storage is an emerging and growing application in enterprise storage whereby enterprises are using higher capacity disc
drives to store less frequently accessed, less time-critical, but capacity-intensive data. Because of recent decreases in cost per gigabyte, business critical electronic data, which historically has been stored on tape or other backup and archival
technologies, are now being stored on these high capacity disc drives. In the long-term, however, we believe that this trend towards business critical systems that utilize high capacity, enterprise class serial advanced technology architecture
(SATA) and serial attached small computer system interface (SAS) will, in addition to expanding the overall enterprise market, likely shift some demand from disc drives used in traditional mission critical enterprise storage.



Disc Drives for Branded Solutions

.    We believe that the proliferation of
media-rich digital content has increased consumer demand for storage to augment their current desktop or notebook disc drive capacities. Consumers are also using external branded storage solutions to backup and secure data in case of disaster or
system failure.

Disc Drives for Desktop
Computing.

We believe growth in disc drives for desktop computing has recently moderated, in part due to the growth in demand for notebook computers, particularly in developed countries. We believe that current growth in
demand for disc drives in desktop computing is focused on developing markets where price remains a primary consideration. Demand for inexpensive, high capacity external storage has also driven growth of 3.5-inch desktop disc drives.

Disc Drives for Consumer
Electronics.

Disc drives in the consumer electronics markets are primarily used in high-capacity solutions, such as DVRs, that require more storage capability than can be provided in a cost-effective manner
through alternative technologies such as flash memory, which is used in lower capacity consumer electronics applications. We believe the demand for disc drives in consumer electronics will become more pronounced with the increased amount of high
definition content that requires larger amounts of storage capacity. Although solid state or flash memory has largely replaced disc drives in handheld applications, we believe that the demand for disc drives to store, hold or back up related media
content from such handheld devices, continues to grow.

Success in the Disc Drive Industry Depends on Technology and Manufacturing Leadership, High Levels of Capital and Research and Development Investments and Large Scale Operations

The design and manufacturing of disc drives depends on highly advanced
technology and manufacturing techniques, especially in the areas of read/write heads and recording media, thereby requiring high levels of capital and significant research and development investments. Disc drive manufacturers are distinguished by
their level of vertical integration, which is the degree to which they control the technology used in their products, and by whether they are captive, producing disc drives for their own computer systems, or independent, producing disc drives as a
stand-alone product. Integrated manufacturers are companies that design and produce the critical technologies, including read/write heads and recording media, used in their disc drives. An integrated approach enables them to lower manufacturing
costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently. In contrast, manufacturers that are not integrated purchase most of their components from third-party suppliers, upon whom they depend for key elements of
their technological innovation and differentiation. This can limit their ability to coordinate technology roadmaps and optimize the component design process for manufacturing efficiency and product reliability while making them reliant on the
technology investment decisions of their suppliers. Independent manufacturers can enjoy a competitive advantage over captive manufacturers in working with OEMs because they do not compete with OEMs for computer system sales. We believe the
competitive dynamics of the disc drive industry favor integrated, independent manufacturers with the scale to make substantial technology investments and apply them across a broad product portfolio and set of customers.

Due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate
and improve manufacturing efficiency and because of the increasing amounts of capital and research and development investments required, the disc drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disc drive manufacturers and component
manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry. Through such combinations, disc drive manufacturers have also become increasingly vertically integrated. While recent combinations have limited the opportunity for additional industry
consolidation, the increasing technological challenges, associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of large-scale operations, may still drive future industry consolidation.

Disc Drive Technology

Overview

All of our disc drive products incorporate certain components, including a head disc assembly and a printed circuit board, which are sealed inside a rigid
base and top cover containing these components in a contamination controlled environment.



The head disc assembly consists of one or more discs attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle
motor that rotates the discs at a high constant speed around a hub. The discs, or recording media, are the components on which data is stored and from which it is retrieved. Each disc typically consists of a substrate of finely machined aluminum or
glass with a layer of a thin-film magnetic material. Read/write heads, mounted on an arm assembly similar in concept to that of a record player, fly extremely close to each disc surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in
the magnetic layers of the rotating discs. The read/write heads are mounted vertically on an E-shaped assembly. The E-block and the recording media are mounted inside a metal casing, called the base casing.

The printed circuit board contains standard and custom application specific
integrated circuits (ASICs) and ancillary electronic control chips. ASICs move data to and from the read/write head and the internal controller, or interface, which communicates with the host computer. The ASICs and control chips form an electronic
circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disc where the data is recorded or retrieved. Disc drive manufacturers typically use one or more of several
industry standard interfaces such as advanced technology architecture (ATA); SATA, which provides higher data transfer rates than the previous ATA standard; small computer system interface (SCSI); SAS; and Fibre Channel.

Disc Drive Performance

Disc drive performance is commonly differentiated by six key
characteristics:

•

storage capacity, commonly expressed in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB), which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disc;

•

spindle rotation speed, commonly expressed in revolutions per minute (RPM), which has an effect on speed of access to data;

•

interface transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data moves between the disc drive and the computer controller;

•

average seek time, commonly expressed in milliseconds, which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disc surface,

•

data transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disc; and

•

product quality and reliability, commonly expressed in annualized return rates (ARR).

Areal Density

Areal density is a measure of storage capacity per square inch on the
recording surface of a disc. Current areal densities are sufficient to meet the requirements of most applications today. The capacity of a disc drive is determined by the number of discs it contains as well as the areal density of these discs. We
expect the long-term demand for increased disc drive capacities will continue to grow proportionately with the shift in storage applications from predominantly compute applications to more media-rich content. In particular, audio, video and photo
storage data continue to increase in size, with high definition video content an example of data requiring many multiples of the storage capacity of standard video. We believe that demand will further intensify by the proliferation of these forms of
content. We have pursued, and expect to continue to pursue, a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products to increase disc drive capacities allowing us to use fewer discs per disc drive and potentially
reduce product costs overtime.

Manufacturing

We pursue a vertically integrated business strategy based on the ownership
of critical component technologies, allowing us to maintain control over our product roadmap and component cost, quality and availability. We believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy, we are well suited to



meet the challenges posed by the close interdependence of components for disc drives. Our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of
our integrated business strategy. We continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and cost by:

•

employing manufacturing automation to enhance our efficiency and flexibility;

•

improving product quality and reliability, and reducing costs;

•

integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements;

•

coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing; and

•

rationalizing the facilities we operate and reducing the number of personnel we employ.

Manufacturing our disc drives is a complex process that begins with the
production of individual components and ends with a fully assembled unit. We design, fabricate and/or assemble a number of the most important components found in our disc drives, including read/write heads and recording media. Our design and
manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disc drive products that serve multiple disc drive applications and markets. As an example, our 3.5-inch SATA disc drive with perpendicular recording
technology platform is sold to customers for use in desktop, enterprise and consumer electronics applications. Our main technology platforms are primarily focused around areal density of media and read/write head technologies. Our integrated
platform technologies and manufacturing allow our set of disc drive products to be used in a wide range of electronic data storage applications and in a wide range of industries.

Read/Write Heads.

The function of the read/write head is to scan across the disc as it spins,
magnetically recording or reading information. The tolerances of recording heads are extremely demanding and require state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our read/write heads are manufactured with thin-film and photolithographic processes
similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits, though challenges in magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disc drive industry. Beginning with six and eight-inch round ceramic wafers, we process
more than 30,000 head elements at one time. Each of these head elements goes through more than 500 steps, all in clean room environments. We have upgraded our fabrication facilities in capital equipment and systems to deliver the required complexity
and precision needed to complete our product transition to perpendicular recording technology, which we achieved during fiscal year 2008. Additional capital investments will be driven primarily by volume. We perform all primary stages of design and
manufacture of read/write heads at our facilities. We currently manufacture all of our read/write heads. We are currently evaluating third party read/write head for use in future products.

Recording Heads and Media.

The percentage of
our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter. Our long-term strategy is to externally purchase approximately 10% of total recording media requirements. In July 2008, we announced the proposed closure
of our recording media manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. The closure is part of our ongoing focus on cost-efficiencies in all areas of our business. We plan to cease production at the Milpitas manufacturing facility in
October 2008. We are continuing to expand our recording media production facilities in Singapore. We expect meaningful output from our new media facility in Singapore beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and we believe we will have
adequate internal and external supply plans in place to support our requirements. Similar to our long-term strategy on recording media supply, our future plans include the evaluation and external purchase of approximately 10% of recording heads
requirements.

We purchase all of our glass substrates from
third parties (mainly in Japan), which are used to manufacture our disc drives for mobile and small form factor consumer electronics products. Historically, we purchase approximately 70% of our aluminum substrates for recording media production from
third parties. In December 2007, we announced the proposed closure of our substrate manufacturing facility in Limavady, Northern Ireland.



The proposed closure is part of our ongoing focus on cost-efficiencies in all areas of our business. We plan to cease production at our Limavady facility
during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. We are in the process of adding an aluminum substrate manufacturing facility in Johor, Malaysia which will allow us to be more cost competitive and position us for future expansion, and reduce our
external substrate purchases to approximately 50%. We expect meaningful output from our Johor facility in during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Commodity and Other Manufacturing Costs.

The production of disc drives requires precious metals, scarce alloys and
industrial commodities, that are subject to fluctuations in prices, and the supply of which has at times been constrained. Recent increases in the price of many commodities have resulted in higher material costs for our products. Additionally,
adverse economic conditions such as rising fuel costs may further increase our costs related to commodities, manufacturing and freight. Should we not be able to pass these increased costs onto our customers, our gross margins may be impacted.

In order to mitigate susceptibility to these conditions, we
may maintain increased inventory of precious metals, scarce alloys and industrial commodities. In addition, we have increased our use of ocean shipments to help offset the increase in freight costs.

Printed Circuit Boards.

Printed circuit boards
are the boards that contain the electronic circuitry and ASICs that provide the electronic controls of the disc drive and on which the head-disc assembly is mounted. During fiscal year 2008, we completed the outsourcing of the manufacture and
assembly of the printed circuit boards used in our disc drives to third parties.

Spindle Motors.

We participate in the design of many of our spindle motors and purchase them principally from outside vendors in Asia, whom we have licensed to use our intellectual
property and technology.

ASICs.

We participate in the design of many of the ASICs used in our disc drives for motor and actuator control, such as interface controllers, read/write channels and pre-amplifiers. We do not manufacture any
ASICs but, rather, buy them from third-party suppliers.

Disc Drive Assembly.

Following the production of the individual components of the disc drive, the first step in the manufacture of a disc drive itself is the assembly of the actuator arm, read/write heads,
discs and spindle motor in a housing to form the head-disc assembly. The production of the head-disc assembly involves largely automated processes. Printed circuit boards are then mated to the head-disc assembly and the completed unit is tested
prior to packaging and shipment. Disc drive assembly and test operations occur primarily at facilities located in China, Singapore and Thailand. We perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in China, Malaysia,
Northern Ireland, Singapore, Thailand, and in the United States, in California and Minnesota. In addition, third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various Asian countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, in Europe and the United States.

Customers

We sell our disc drive products primarily to major OEMs and distributors.
OEM customers, either themselves or through their contract manufacturers, incorporate our disc drives into computer systems and storage systems for resale. Distributors typically sell our disc drives to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and
other resellers. Shipments to OEMs were approximately 67%, 64% and 72% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Shipments to distributors were approximately 26%, 30% and 25% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal
years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The only customer exceeding 10% of our disc drive revenue for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 was HP. Dell exceeded 10% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 and 2006. Sales to HP accounted for
approximately 16%, 16% and 17% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales to Dell, as a percentage of our disc drive revenue, were 11%, 9% and 11% in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No other
customer accounted for 10% or more of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. Retail sales of our branded storage products in fiscal year 2008 as a percentage of our disc drive revenue increased to 7% from 6% and 3% in fiscal
years 2007 and 2006, respectively. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Dependence on Key Customers—We may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced, delayed or cancelled purchases by, one or more
of our larger customers.”

OEM customers typically enter
into master purchase agreements with us. These agreements provide for pricing, volume discounts, order lead times, product support obligations and other terms and conditions. The term of these agreements is usually 12 to 36 months, although our
product support obligations generally extend substantially beyond this period. These master agreements typically do not commit the customer to buy any minimum quantity of products, or create exclusive relationships. Deliveries are scheduled only
after receipt of purchase orders. In addition, with limited lead-time, customers may cancel or defer most purchase orders without significant penalty. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or OEM
delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs.

Our distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements for the resale of our products. They typically furnish us with a non-binding indication of
their near-term requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly. The agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited right of return and price protection rights. In addition, we offer
sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel.

We have increased our sales of branded storage products to retail customers in the last two years further expanding our retail customer base. Our branded
storage product is sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors. Retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support, sales incentives and price protection periods.

We also regularly enter into agreements with our customers, which obligate us
to provide a limited indemnity against losses resulting from intellectual property claims. These agreements are customary in our industry and typically require us to indemnify our customers against certain damages and costs incurred as a result of
third party intellectual property claims arising as a result of their use of our products.

Sales, Marketing and Customer Service

Our marketing organization works to increase demand for our disc drive products through strategic collaboration with key OEM customers and distribution partners to align our respective product roadmaps and to



build our brand and end-customer relationships. As customers and markets increasingly demand a broad variety of products with different performance and cost
attributes, we have marketing groups focused on the strategic needs of our increasingly diverse customer base. We believe this enables us to serve both our core markets and better identify, develop and serve emerging markets.

Our sales organization focuses on deepening our relationship with our
customers. The worldwide sales group focuses on geographic coverage of OEMs and distributors throughout most of the world. The worldwide sales group is organized by customer type and regionally among Americas, Japan, Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan)
and Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In addition, we have a sales operation group which focuses on aligning our production levels with customers’ product requirements. Our sales force works directly with our marketing organization to
coordinate our OEM and distribution channel relationships. We maintain sales offices throughout the United States and in Australia, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

With the acquisition of Maxtor, we acquired the right to the use the Maxtor
and other related brand names. We believe the Maxtor brand is a valuable asset, and we intend to continue to offer the Maxtor brand of products to consumers globally to broaden our reach into and coverage of these channels as well as optimize the
impact of our marketing investments.

Our customer service
organization maintains a global network of service points to process warranty returns and manage outsourced repair vendors. We generally warrant our products for periods ranging from three to five years.

Foreign sales are subject to foreign exchange controls and other
restrictions, including, in the case of some countries, approval by the Office of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce and other U.S. governmental agencies.

Competition

The markets that we compete in are intensely competitive, with disc drive manufacturers not only competing for a limited number of major disc drive
customers, but also increasingly competing with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide alternative storage solutions, such as flash memory, tape, optical and SSDs. Some of the principal factors used by customers to
differentiate among electronic data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity; price per unit and price per gigabyte; storage/retrieval access times; data transfer rates; product quality and reliability; supply continuity; form factor;
warranty; and brand.

We believe that our disc drive products
are competitive with respect to each of these factors in the markets that we currently address. We summarize below our principal disc drive competitors, other competitors, the effect of competition on price erosion for our products and product life
cycles and technology.

Principal Disc Drive
Competitors.

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we have. These
competitors include independent disc drive manufacturers such as Western Digital, as well as large captive manufacturers such as Fujitsu, Samsung, Hitachi, and Toshiba. Because they produce complete computer systems and other non-compute consumer
electronics and mobile devices, these “captive manufacturers” can derive a greater portion of their operating margins from other components, which reduces their need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in their computer systems
and allows them to sell disc drives to third parties at very low margins. Many captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources and greater access to their internal customers than we do. In addition,
Toshiba and Samsung, each are increasingly integrating other storage technologies such as flash memory, hybrid disc drives and SSDs into its product offerings. Not only may they be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their
overall business strategy, their portfolio allows them to be indifferent to which technology prevails over the other. They can offer a broad range of storage media and solutions and focus on those with lowest costs and greatest sales. In connection
with our branded storage products, in addition to



competing with our disc drive competitors, we also compete with companies such as LaCie S.A. that purchase disc drives for use in their branded storage
products from us and our competitors.

Other
Competitors.

We also are experiencing competition from companies that provide alternative storage technologies such as flash memory, which have substantially replaced disc drives in lower capacity handheld devices.
Principal competitors include Samsung, Toshiba, Micron, SanDisk and Intel.

Price Erosion.

Our industry has been characterized by continuous price erosion for disc drive products with comparable capacity, performance and feature sets (i.e., “like-for-like
products”). Price erosion for like-for-like products (“price erosion”) is more pronounced during periods of:

•

industry consolidation in which competitors aggressively use discounted price to gain market share;

•

few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings;

•

temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand; and

•

seasonally weaker demand which may cause excess supply.

Disc drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disc drive products characterized by higher capacity, better
performance and additional feature sets and/or product cost reductions.

We expect price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future. To remain competitive, we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced
technologies ahead of our competitors in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structure on these new products.

Product Life Cycles and Changing Technology.

Our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology,
which have contributed to rapid product life cycles. As a result, success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the first-to-market with new products, allowing those disc drive manufacturers who introduce new
products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced. Also, because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion, the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated the need to quickly
achieve product cost effectiveness. Changing technology also necessitates the need for on-going investments in research and development, which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles. Further, there is a continued need to
successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions, as factors such as quality, reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to
rapidly develop, manufacture and market products of high quality and reliability on a cost-effective basis. Introduction of any technology that delivers storage at an attractive price, or has other features not offered by disc drives, may be
disruptive to the disc drive industry.

Seasonality

The disc drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in
demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year. This seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the back-to-school season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter. In
addition, corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year when IT budget calendars provide for more spending.

Research and Development

We are committed to developing new component technologies, products and alternative storage technologies, including solid state technology. Our research
and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume, with quality attributes that our customers expect, before our competitors. Part of our product development strategy is to leverage a common platform and subsystem
within product families to serve different market needs. This platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization, reduces



exposure to changes in demand, and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies. Our advanced technology integration effort focuses
disc drive and component research on recording subsystems, including read/write heads and recording media, market-specific product technology as well as technology focused towards new business opportunities. The primary purpose of our advanced
technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies to our product development teams as well as allowing us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order
to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had product development expenses of approximately $1 billion, $904 million and $805 million, respectively, which represented 8%, 8% and
9% of our consolidated revenue, respectively.

Patents and Licenses

As of June 27, 2008, we had approximately 4,015
U.S. patents and 723 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1,188 U.S. and 579 foreign patent applications pending. The number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our
ongoing patent portfolio management activity. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the electronic data storage industry, we believe that the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secret law, protection of
unpatented proprietary know-how and development of new products are generally more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, we believe that patents are valuable to our business and
intend to continue our efforts to protect and obtain patents, where available, in connection with our research and development program.

The electronic data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. Because of
rapid technological development in the electronic data storage industry, some of our products have been, and in the future could be, alleged to infringe existing patents of third parties. From time to time, we receive claims that our products
infringe patents of third parties. Although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims by obtaining licenses or rights under the patents in question without a material adverse affect on us, other claims have resulted in
adverse decisions or settlements. In addition, other claims are pending which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For more information on these claims, see “Item 3.
Legal Proceedings.” The costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been and may be substantial, irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome. We have patent licenses with a number of companies.
Additionally, as part of our normal intellectual property practices, we may be engaged in negotiations with other major electronic data storage companies and component manufacturers with respect to licenses.

Backlog

In view of our customers’ rights to cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty, we believe backlog in the disc drive industry is
of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results.

Employees

At June 27, 2008, we employed
approximately 54,000 employees, temporary employees and contractors worldwide, of which approximately 42,000 employees were located in our Asian operations. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract
and retain qualified employees at all levels. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous
substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by
issuing authorities.



We have established environmental systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard
operating procedures for our operations worldwide. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. We budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with
environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures.

Some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as
amended, the “Superfund” law and its state equivalents), can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites,
regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. We were identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites. At
each of these sites, we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties. We have fulfilled our
responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time.

While our ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy, based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs, we do not expect
costs in connection with these superfund sites and contaminated sites to be material.

We may be subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. For example, the
European Union (“EU”) enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), which prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in certain products,
including disc drives, put on the market after July 1, 2006 as well as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) directive, which makes producers of electrical goods, including disc drives, financially responsible for
specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China and Japan.

If we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions,
recycle requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Business

Competition—Our industry is highly competitive and our products have experienced and will continue to experience significant price erosion and market share variability.

Even during periods when demand is strong, the disc drive industry is
intensely competitive and vendors typically experience substantial price erosion over the life of a product. Our competitors have historically offered existing products at lower prices as part of a strategy to gain or retain market share and
customers, and we expect these practices to continue. We will need to continually reduce our prices to retain our market share, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

We believe this basic industry condition of continuing price erosion and market share variability will continue, as our
competitors engage in aggressive pricing actions targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand. The pricing environment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 was substantially as we had initially expected, and we expect continuous price erosion
for fiscal year 2009 as our competitors continue these efforts.

Our ability to offset the effect of price erosion through new product introductions at higher average prices is diminished to the extent competitors introduce products into particular markets ahead of our similar, competing products. Our
ability to offset the effect of price erosion is also diminished during times when product life cycles for particular products are extended, allowing competitors more time to enter the market. The growth of sales to distributors that serve producers
of non-branded products in the personal storage sector may also contribute to increased price erosion. These customers generally have limited product qualification programs, which increases the number of competing products available to satisfy their
demand. As a result, purchasing decisions for these customers are based largely on price and terms. Any increase in our average price erosion would have an adverse effect on our result of operations.

Additionally, a significant portion of our success in the past has been a
result of increasing our market share at the expense of our competitors, particularly in the notebook and small form factor enterprise markets. Market share for our products can be negatively affected by our customers’ diversifying their
sources of supply as our competitors enter the market for particular products, as well as by our ability to ramp volume production of new product offerings. When our competitors successfully introduce product offerings, which are competitive with
our recently introduced products, our customers may quickly diversify their sources of supply. Any significant decline in our market share in any of our principal market applications would adversely affect our results of operations.

Principal Competitors—We compete with both independent
manufacturers, whose primary focus is producing technologically advanced disc drives, and captive manufacturers, who do not depend solely on sales of disc drives to maintain their profitability.

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition
from a number of domestic and foreign companies, including other independent disc drive manufacturers and large captive manufacturers such as:

The term
“independent” in this context refers to manufacturers that primarily produce disc drives as a stand-alone product, and the term “captive” refers to disc drive manufacturers who themselves or through affiliated



entities produce complete computer or other systems that contain disc drives or other electronic data storage products. Captive manufacturers are formidable
competitors because they have the ability to determine pricing for complete systems without regard to the margins on individual components. Because components other than disc drives generally contribute a greater portion of the operating margin on a
complete computer system than do disc drives, captive manufacturers do not necessarily need to realize a profit on the disc drives included in a complete computer system and, as a result, may be willing to sell disc drives to third parties at very
low margins. In addition, captive manufacturers are also formidable competitors because they have more substantial resources than we do. Samsung and Hitachi (together with affiliated entities) also sell other products to our customers, including
critical components like flash memory, ASICs and flat panel displays, and may be willing to sell their disc drives at a lower margin to advance their overall business strategy. This may improve their ability to compete with us. To the extent we are
not successful competing with captive or independent disc drive manufacturers, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

In response to customer demand for high-quality, high-volume and low-cost disc drives, manufacturers of disc drives have had to develop large, in some
cases global, production facilities with highly developed technological capabilities and internal controls. The development of large production facilities and industry consolidation can contribute to the intensification of competition.

We face indirect competition from present and potential customers who
evaluate from time to time whether to manufacture their own disc drives or other electronic data storage products.

We have also experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory, where increased capacity,
improving cost, lower power consumption and performance ruggedness have resulted in competition with our lower capacity, smaller form factor disc drives in handheld applications. While this competition has traditionally been in the markets for
handheld consumer electronics applications, these competitors have recently announced solid state drives (“SSDs”) for notebook and enterprise compute applications. Some of these companies, like Samsung, also sell disc drives. Certain
customers for both enterprise and notebook compute applications have indicated an interest in investigating SSDs as alternatives to hard drives in certain applications.

Volatility of Quarterly Results—Our quarterly operating results fluctuate, sometimes significantly, from period to period, and
this may cause our share prices to decline.

In the
past, our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated, sometimes significantly, from period to period. These fluctuations, which we expect to continue, may be occasioned by a variety of factors, including:

•

adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the United States and other major regions in which we do business, though especially in the United States,
where economic activity slowed during the second half of our fiscal 2008;

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices by our competitors targeted to encourage shifting of customer demand;

•

delays or problems in our introduction of new products, particularly new disc drives with lower cost structures, due to inability to achieve high production yields,
delays in customer qualification or initial product quality issues;

•

changes in purchasing patterns by our distributor customers;

•

increased costs or adverse changes in availability of supplies of raw materials or components, especially in light of recent consolidation among component
suppliers, building inflationary pressure, and the continuing weakness of the U.S. Dollar as compared to other currencies;

•

the impact of corporate restructuring activities that we may engage in;



•

changes in the demand for the computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics that contain our disc drives, due to seasonality, economic conditions
and other factors;

•

changes in purchases from period to period by our primary customers, particularly as our competitors are able to introduce and produce in volume competing disc
drive solutions or alternative storage technology solutions, such as flash memory or SSDs;

•

shifting trends in customer demand which, when combined with overproduction of particular products, particularly when the industry is served by multiple suppliers,
results in supply/demand imbalances;

•

our high proportion of fixed costs, including research and development expenses; and

•

announcements of new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue
and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research
analysts or investors, which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares.

New Product Offerings—Market acceptance of new product introductions cannot be accurately predicted, and our results of operations will suffer
if there is less demand for our new products than is anticipated.

We are continually developing new products with the goal that we will be able to introduce technologically advanced and lower cost disc drives into the marketplace ahead of our competitors.

The success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of
factors, including market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the risk that our new products will have quality
problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products. Accordingly, we cannot accurately determine the ultimate effect that our new products will have on our results of operations.

In addition, the success of our new product introductions is
dependent upon our ability to qualify as a primary source of supply with our OEM customers. In order for our products to be considered by our customers for qualification, we must be among the leaders in time-to-market with those new products. Once a
product is accepted for qualification testing, any failure or delay in the qualification process or a requirement that we requalify can result in our losing sales to that customer until new products are introduced. The limited number of high-volume
OEMs magnifies the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity. These risks are further magnified because we expect competitive pressures to result in declining sales and declining gross margins on our current generation products. We
cannot assure you that we will be among the leaders in time-to-market with new products or that we will be able to successfully qualify new products with our customers in the future. If we cannot successfully deliver competitive products, then our
future results of operations may be adversely affected.

Smaller Form Factor Disc Drives—If we do not continue to successfully market smaller form factor disc drives, our business may suffer.

The disc drive industry is experiencing significant increases in sales of smaller form factor disc drives for an expanding number of
applications, in particular notebook computers and consumer electronics devices, but also including personal computers and enterprise storage applications. Much of our recent revenue growth is derived from the sale of small form factor drives for
notebook and enterprise applications. Our continued success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce such small form factor drives at desired price and capacity points faster than our competitors.

We have experienced competition from other companies that produce alternative
storage technologies like solid state or flash memory, where increased capacity, improving cost, lower power consumption and



performance ruggedness have resulted in flash memory largely replacing disc drives in handheld applications. We believe that the demand for disc drives to
store or back up related media content from such handheld devices, however, continues to grow. While this competition has traditionally been limited to the markets for handheld consumer electronics applications, these competitors have announced SSDs
for notebook and enterprise compute applications.

If we do not
suitably adapt our product offerings to successfully introduce additional smaller form factor disc drives or alternative storage products based on flash storage technology, or if our competitors are successful in achieving customer acceptance of SSD
products for notebook and enterprise compute applications, then our customers may decrease the amounts of our products that they purchase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

Seasonality—Because we experience seasonality in the sales of our
products, our results of operations will generally be adversely impacted during the second half of our fiscal year.

Sales of computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal, and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality
in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for disc drives. In particular, we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year. In the mobile compute, desktop
compute and consumer electronics sectors of our business, this seasonality is partially attributable to our customers’ increased sales of personal computers and consumer electronics during the winter holiday season. In the enterprise sector of
our business, our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users. Since our working capital needs peak during periods in which we are increasing production in anticipation of orders that have not yet been
received, our operating results will fluctuate seasonally even if the forecasted demand for our products proves accurate. Furthermore, it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality may affect our business in future periods
because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions, particularly in the consumer electronics market.

Difficulty in Predicting Quarterly Demand—If we fail to predict demand accurately for our products in any quarter, we may not be able to
recapture the cost of our investments.

The disc drive
industry operates on quarterly purchasing cycles, with much of the order flow in any given quarter coming at the end of that quarter. Our manufacturing process requires us to make significant product-specific investments in inventory in each quarter
for that quarter’s production. Since we typically receive the bulk of our orders late in a quarter after we have made our investments, there is a risk that our orders will not be sufficient to allow us to recapture the costs of our investment
before the products resulting from that investment have become obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately predict demand in the future.

Another factor that may negatively affect our ability to recapture costs of investments in future quarters is the current uncertain condition of the
domestic and global economy. The current uncertainty in economic and political conditions in many of our markets may have an affect on demand for our products and render budgeting and forecasting difficult. The difficulty in forecasting demand
increases the difficulty in anticipating our inventory requirements, which may cause us to over-produce finished goods, resulting in inventory write-offs, or under-produce finished goods, affecting our ability to meet customer requirements.
Additionally, the risk of inventory write-offs could increase if we were to continue to hold higher inventory levels. We cannot be certain that we will be able to recover the costs associated with increased inventory.

Other factors that may negatively impact our ability to recapture the cost of
investments in any given quarter include:

•

the impact of variable demand and an aggressive pricing environment for disc drives;

•

the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply both with respect to particular disc drive products and with respect to
competing alternative storage technology solutions such as SSDs in notebook and enterprise compute applications;



•

our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match sales in any quarter because of our vertical manufacturing strategy, which means that we make more capital
investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated;

•

dependence on our ability to successfully qualify, manufacture and sell in increasing volumes on a cost-effective basis and with acceptable quality our disc drive
products, particularly the new disc drive products with lower cost structures;

•

variations in the cost of components for our products, especially in view of the U.S. dollar’s continued weakness as compared to other currencies;

•

uncertainty in the amount of purchases from our distributor customers who from time to time constitute a large portion of our total sales;

•

our product mix and the related margins of the various products;

•

accelerated reduction in the price of our disc drives due to technological advances and/or an oversupply of disc drives in the market, a condition that is
exacerbated when the industry is served by multiple suppliers and shifting trends in demand which can create supply demand imbalances;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions, particularly at our major manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Singapore or Thailand;

•

limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited number of suppliers;

•

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of producing our products and the effective price of our products to foreign
consumers; and

•

operational issues arising out of the increasingly automated nature of our manufacturing processes.

Importance of Time-to-Market—Our operating results may depend on
our being among the first-to-market and achieving sufficient production volume with our new products.

To achieve consistent success with our OEM customers, it is important that we be an early provider of new types of disc drives featuring leading,
high-quality technology and lower per gigabyte storage cost. Historically, our operating results have substantially depended upon our ability to be among the first-to-market with new product offerings. Our market share and operating results in the
future may be adversely affected if we fail to:

•

consistently maintain our time-to-market performance with our new products;

•

produce these products in sufficient volume;

•

qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers’ performance and quality specifications; or

•

achieve acceptable manufacturing yields, quality and costs with these products.

If delivery of our products is delayed, our OEM customers may use our competitors’ products to meet their production
requirements. If the delay of our products causes delivery of those OEMs’ computer systems into which our products are integrated to be delayed, consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the OEMs’ competitors.

Moreover, we face the related risk that consumers and
businesses may wait to make their purchases if they want to buy a new product that has been shipped or announced but not yet released. If this were to occur, we may be unable to sell our existing inventory of products that may be less efficient and
cost effective compared to new products. As a result, even if we are among the first-to-market with a given product, subsequent introductions or announcements by our competitors of new products could cause us to lose revenue and not achieve a
positive return on our investment in existing products and inventory.



Dependence on Sales of Disc Drives in Consumer Electronics Applications—Our sales of disc
drives for consumer electronics applications which have contributed significant revenues to our results, can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors, which could materially adversely impact our future results of
operations.

Our sales of disc drives for consumer
electronics applications have contributed significant revenues to our results for the past several years. The growth rate in consumer electronics products has recently begun to moderate and show more seasonal demand variability. The demand for
consumer electronics products can be even more volatile and unpredictable than the demand for compute products, particularly as it is difficult to predict the cycles in which, for example, new gaming products are launched and consumer uptake of
those products. In some cases, our products manufactured for consumer electronics applications are uniquely configured for a single customer’s application, which creates a risk of exposure if the anticipated volumes are not realized. This
potential for unpredictable volatility is increased by the possibility of competing alternative storage technologies like flash memory, meeting the customers’ cost and capacity metrics, resulting in a rapid shift in demand from our products and
disc drive technology, generally, to alternative storage technologies. Unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our products or rapid shifts in demand from our products to alternative storage technologies in new consumer electronics applications
could materially adversely impact our future results of operations.

Dependence on Sales of Disc Drives Directly to Consumers Through Retail Outlets—Our sales of disc drives directly to consumers through retail outlets can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors which
could materially adversely impact our future results of operations.

We believe that industry demand for storage products is increasing due to the proliferation of media-rich digital content in consumer applications and is fuelling increased consumer demand for storage. This has led to
the expansion of solutions such as external storage products to provide additional storage capacity and to secure data in case of disaster or system failure, or to provide independent storage solutions for multiple users in home or small business
environments. The current uncertainty in the domestic and global economy may negatively affect demand for such products. Further, such retail sales of our branded solutions traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels
of demand in the second half of the calendar year driven by consumer spending in the back-to-school season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter. Additionally, our ability to reach such consumers
depends on our maintaining effective working relationships with major retail and online distributors. Failure to anticipate consumer demand for our branded solutions as well as an inability to maintain effective working relationships with retail and
online distributors may adversely impact our future results of operations.

Dependence on Supply of Components, Equipment, and Raw Materials—If we experience shortages or delays in the receipt of critical components, equipment or raw materials necessary to manufacture our products,
we may suffer lower operating margins, production delays and other material adverse effects.

The cost, quality and availability of components, certain equipment and raw materials used to manufacture disc drives and key components like recording
media and heads are critical to our success. The equipment we use to manufacture our products and components is frequently custom made and comes from a few suppliers and the lead times required to obtain manufacturing equipment can be significant.
Particularly important components for disc drives include read/write heads, aluminum or glass substrates for recording media, ASICs, spindle motors, printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies. We rely on sole suppliers or a limited number of
suppliers for some of these components, including media, aluminum and glass substrates that we do not manufacture, recording media and heads, ASICs, spindle motors, printed circuit boards and suspension assemblies. If our vendors for these
components are unable to meet our requirements, we could experience a shortage in supply, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

In the past, we have experienced increased costs and production delays when we were unable to obtain the necessary equipment or sufficient quantities of
some components and/or have been forced to pay higher prices or



make volume purchase commitments or advance deposits for some components, equipment or raw materials that were in short supply in the industry in general.

Consolidation among component manufacturers may result in some
component manufacturers exiting the industry or not making sufficient investments in research to develop new components.

If there is a shortage of, or delay in supplying us with, critical components, equipment or raw materials, then:

•

it is likely that our suppliers would raise their prices and, if we could not pass these price increases to our customers, our operating margin would decline;

•

we might have to reengineer some products, which would likely cause production and shipment delays, make the reengineered products more costly and provide us with a
lower rate of return on these products;

•

we would likely have to allocate the components we receive to certain of our products and ship less of others, which could reduce our revenues and could cause us to
lose sales to customers who could purchase more of their required products from manufacturers that either did not experience these shortages or delays or that made different allocations; and

•

we might be late in shipping products, causing potential customers to make purchases from our competitors, thus causing our revenue and operating margin to decline.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to
obtain critical components in a timely and economic manner, or at all.

Perpendicular Recording Technology—Products based on perpendicular technology require increased quantities of precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium which increases risk of higher costs and production
delays that could adversely impact our operating results.

Perpendicular recording technology also requires recording media with more layers and the use of more precious metals and scarce alloys like platinum and ruthenium to create such layers. These precious metals and scarce alloys have recently
become increasingly expensive and at times difficult to acquire. Accordingly, we will be exposed to increased risks that higher costs or reduced availability of these precious metals and scarce alloys could adversely impact our operating results.

Importance of Controlling Operating Costs—If we do
not control our operating expenses, we will not be able to compete effectively in our industry.

Our strategy involves, to a substantial degree, increasing revenue and product volume while at the same time controlling operating expenses. In the past,
these activities have included closures and transfers of facilities, significant personnel reductions and efforts to increase automation. Moreover, the reduction of personnel and closure of facilities may adversely affect our ability to manufacture
our products in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other disruptions that affect our products and customer service. In addition, the transfer of manufacturing capacity of a product to a different facility frequently requires
qualification of the new facility by some of our OEM customers. We cannot assure you that these activities and transfers will be implemented on a cost-effective basis without delays or disruption in our production and without adversely affecting our
customer relationships and results of operations.

Industry Demand—Changes in demand for computer systems and storage subsystems have caused and may cause in the future a decline in demand for our products.

Our disc drives are components in computers, computer systems, storage subsystems and consumer electronics devices. The
demand for these products has been volatile. In a weak economy, consumer spending



tends to decline and retail demand for personal computers and consumer electronics devices tends to decrease, as does enterprise demand for computer systems
and storage subsystems. Unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems, storage subsystems or consumer electronic devices generally cause sharp declines in demand for disc drive products.

Additional causes of declines in demand for our products in the past have
included announcements or introductions of major new operating systems or semiconductor improvements or changes in consumer preferences, such as the shift from desktop to notebook computers. We believe these announcements and introductions have from
time to time caused consumers to defer their purchases and made inventory obsolete. Whenever an oversupply of disc drives causes participants in our industry to have higher than anticipated inventory levels, we experience even more intense price
competition from other disc drive manufacturers than usual.

Dependence on Distributors—We are dependent on sales to distributors and retailers, which may increase price erosion and the volatility of our sales.

In addition to our own sales force, a substantial portion of our sales has been to distributors of desktop disc drive
products. Certain of our distributors may also market other products that compete with our products. Product qualification programs in this distribution channel are limited, which increases the number of competing products that are available to
satisfy demand, particularly in times of lengthening product cycles. As a result, purchasing decisions in this channel are based largely on price, terms and product availability. Sales volumes through this channel are also less predictable and
subject to greater volatility than sales to our OEM customers.

To the extent that distributors reduce their purchases of our products or prices decline significantly in the distribution channel, and to the extent that our distributor relationships are terminated, our revenues and results of operations
would be adversely affected.

Accounting Charges Related
to Acquisition of Maxtor and other recently acquired companies—We expect the acquisition of Maxtor and other recently acquired companies will continue to result in additional accounting charges, which may continue to have an adverse effect on
our fiscal year 2009 operating results.

We expect
that, as a result of the acquisition of Maxtor and other recently acquired companies, our fiscal year 2009 results of operations will continue to be adversely affected by non-cash accounting charges, the most significant of which relates to the
amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Dependence
on Key Customers—We may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced, delayed or cancelled purchases by, one or more of our larger customers.

Some of our key customers, including Hewlett-Packard, Dell, EMC, Mitac and Bell Microproducts, account for a large portion of our disc drive revenue.
We have longstanding relationships with many of our customers, however, if any of our key customers were to significantly reduce their purchases from us, our results of operations would be adversely affected. While sales to major customers may vary
from period to period, a major customer that permanently discontinues or significantly reduces its relationship with us could be difficult to replace. In line with industry practice, new customers usually require that we pass a lengthy and rigorous
qualification process at the customer’s cost. Accordingly, it may be difficult or costly for us to attract new major customers. Additionally, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or other significant transactions involving our customers
generally entail risks to our business. If a significant transaction involving any of our key customers results in the loss of or reduction in purchases by these key customers, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.



Impact of Technological Change—Increases in the areal density of disc drives may outpace
customers’ demand for storage capacity.

The rate
of increase in areal density, or storage capacity per square inch on a disc, may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity, particularly in certain market applications like commercial desktop compute.
As a result, our customers’ storage capacity needs may be satisfied with lower priced, low capacity disc drives. These factors could decrease our sales, especially when combined with continued price erosion, which could adversely affect our
results of operations.

Changes in Electronic Data
Storage Products—Future changes in the nature of electronic data storage products may reduce demand for traditional disc drive products.

We expect that in the future, new personal computing devices and products will be developed, some of which, such as Internet appliances, may not contain a
disc drive. While we are investing development resources in designing disc drives for new applications, it is too early to assess the impact of these new applications on future demand for disc drive products. Products using alternative technologies,
such as flash memory, optical storage and other storage technologies could become a significant source of competition to particular applications of our products, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

New Product Development and Technological Change—If we do not
develop products in time to keep pace with technological changes, our operating results will be adversely affected.

Our customers have demanded new generations of disc drive products as advances in computer hardware and software have created the need for improved
storage products, with features such as increased storage capacity, improved performance and reliability and lower cost. We, and our competitors, have developed improved products, and we will need to continue to do so in the future. Such product
development requires significant investments in research and development. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design or introduction of new products in a timely manner, that we will be able to manufacture new
products in sufficient volumes with acceptable manufacturing yields, that we will be able to successfully market these new products or that these products will perform to specifications on a long-term basis. In addition, the impact of slowing areal
density growth may adversely impact our ability to be successful.

When we develop new products with higher capacity and more advanced technology, our operating results may decline because the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of
reliability, quality or operability problems. If our products suffer increases in failures, are of low quality or are not reliable, customers may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and scrap costs and service and
warranty costs may increase. In addition, a decline in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with other disc drive manufacturers or competing technologies.

Risks Associated with Future Strategic Alliances, Joint Ventures or
Investments—We may not be able to identify suitable strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or investment opportunities, or successfully acquire and integrate companies that provide complementary products or technologies.

Our growth strategy may involve pursuing strategic alliances
with, and making acquisitions of, forming joint ventures with, or investments in, other companies that are complementary to our business. There is substantial competition for attractive strategic alliance, acquisition, joint venture and investment
candidates. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, joint venture, investment or strategic partnership candidates. Even if we were able to identify them, we cannot assure you that we will be able to partner with, acquire or invest in
suitable candidates, or integrate acquired technologies or operations successfully into our existing technologies and operations. Our ability to finance potential strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or investments will be limited by
our high degree of leverage, the covenants contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding indebtedness, the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and any agreements governing any other debt we may incur.



If we are successful in forming strategic alliances or acquiring, forming joint ventures or making
investments in other companies, any of these transactions may have an adverse effect on our operating results, particularly while the operations of an acquired business are being integrated. It is also likely that integration of acquired companies
would lead to the loss of key employees from those companies or the loss of customers of those companies. In addition, the integration of any acquired companies would require substantial attention from our senior management, which may limit the
amount of time available to be devoted to our day-to-day operations or to the execution of our strategy. Growth by strategic alliance, acquisition, joint venture or investment involves an even higher degree of risk to the extent we combine new
product offerings and enter new markets in which we have limited experience, and no assurance can be given that acquisitions of entities with new or alternative business models will be successfully integrated or achieve their stated objectives.

Furthermore, the expansion of our business involves the risk
that we might not manage our growth effectively, that we would incur additional debt to finance these acquisitions or investments, that we may have impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets associated with these acquisitions and that we
would incur substantial charges relating to the write-off of in-process research and development, similar to that which we incurred in connection with several of our prior acquisitions. Each of these items could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position and results of operations.

In addition, we
could issue additional common shares in connection with future strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or investments. Issuing shares in connection with such transactions would have the effect of diluting your ownership percentage of the
common shares and could cause the price of our common shares to decline.

Risk of Intellectual Property Litigation—Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.

We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not
infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Historically, patent applications in the United States and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, and we may not be aware of
currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology. If patents are later issued on these applications, we may be liable for infringement. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged
infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products.

We are currently subject to lawsuits involving intellectual property claims which could cause us to incur significant
additional costs or prevent us from selling our products, and which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial condition: actions brought in the United States by Convolve, Inc., and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Siemens AG, and StorMedia Texas LLC.

Intellectual
property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert our management’s attention from operating our business. In addition, intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent
uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. Moreover, patent litigation has increased due to the current
uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in the field. If we were to discover that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we would need to obtain licenses from these
parties or substantially reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to reengineer our products successfully. Moreover, if we are sued for
patent infringement and lose the suit, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from
selling our products which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See See Part II, “Item 8, Note 9, Legal, Environmental, and Other Contingencies – Intellectual Property Litigation” for a
description of pending intellectual property proceedings.



Dependence on Key Personnel—The loss of some key executive officers and employees could
negatively impact our business prospects.

Our future
performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing, sales and product development personnel. The loss of one or more of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition. We believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract, retain and further motivate highly skilled management, marketing, sales and product development personnel.
We have experienced intense competition for personnel, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining personnel in the future.

Substantial Leverage—Our substantial leverage may place us at a
competitive disadvantage in our industry.

We are
leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. Our significant debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities.
For example, our high level of debt presents the following risks:

•

we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements;

•

our interest expense could increase if prevailing interest rates increase, because a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at floating rates;

•

our substantial leverage increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive
disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;

•

our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to
pursue other business opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies;

•

our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development
efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and

•

covenants in our debt instruments limit our ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments and investments.

Significant Debt Service Requirements—Servicing our debt requires
a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond our control.

Our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on, our indebtedness or to fund our
other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements.

Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that:

•

our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;

•

we will continue to realize the cost savings, revenue growth and operating improvements that resulted from the execution of our long-term strategic plan; or

•

future sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs.



If we cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital
expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt, or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if
necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our existing debt instruments permit us to incur a significant amount of additional debt. If we incur additional debt above the levels now in effect, the risks
associated with our substantial leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs, could intensify.

Restrictions Imposed by Debt Covenants—Restrictions imposed by our existing credit facility may limit our ability
to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.

Our existing credit facility imposes, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us. Our existing credit facility
may also limit, among other things, our ability to:

•

pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our shares;

•

redeem or repurchase shares;

•

make investments or other restricted payments;

•

sell assets;

•

issue or sell shares of restricted subsidiaries;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

create liens; and

•

effect a consolidation or merger.

These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions that permit us to make significant dividends.

Our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance
with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control.

A breach of any of the covenants described above or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit
facility. If a default occurs, the Administrative Agent of the credit facility may elect to declare all of our outstanding obligations under the credit facility, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If
our outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that debt and any potential future indebtedness, which would cause the market price of our common shares to decline
significantly.

System Failures—System failures
caused by events beyond our control could adversely affect computer equipment and electronic data on which our operations depend.

Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and the electronic data stored in our databases from damage by, among
other things, earthquake, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events. As our operations become more automated and increasingly interdependent, our exposure to the risks posed
by these types of events will increase. While we continue to improve our disaster recovery processes, system failures and other interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.



Economic Risks Associated with International Operations—Our international operations subject
us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations, longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries, seasonality and disruptions in foreign markets, tariffs and duties, price controls, potential adverse tax consequences, increased costs, our
customers’ credit and access to capital and health-related risks.

We have significant operations in foreign countries, including manufacturing facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations. We have manufacturing facilities in China, Malaysia, Northern Ireland,
Singapore and Thailand, in addition to those in the United States. A substantial portion of our desktop disc drive assembly occurs in our facility in China.

Our international operations are subject to economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including the following:

•

Disruptions in Foreign Markets.

Disruptions in financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in the
past in some countries, including those in Asia, have had an impact on our sales to customers located in, or whose end-user customers are located in, these countries.

•

Fluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates.

Prices for our products are denominated predominately in U.S. dollars, even when sold to
customers that are located outside the United States. Currency instability in Asia and other geographic markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other manufacturers that are priced in the local currency. Moreover, many of
the costs associated with our operations located outside the United States are denominated in local currencies. As a consequence, the increased strength of local currencies against the U.S. dollar in countries where we have foreign operations
would result in higher effective operating costs and, potentially, reduced earnings. From time to time, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our operations and profitability and there can be no assurance that these
fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and profitability in the future.

•

Longer Payment Cycles.

Our customers outside of the United States are often allowed longer time periods for payment than our
U.S. customers. This increases the risk of nonpayment due to the possibility that the financial condition of particular customers may worsen during the course of the payment period.

•

Seasonality.

Seasonal reductions in the business activities of our customers during the summer months, particularly in Europe,
typically result in lower earnings during those periods.

•

Tariffs, Duties, Limitations on Trade and Price Controls.

Our international operations are affected by limitations on imports,
currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations, price controls and other restraints on trade. In addition, the governments of many countries, including China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, in which we have significant
operating assets, have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies and international trade.

•

Potential Adverse Tax Consequences.

Our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences, including
imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries.

•

Increased Costs.

The shipping and transportation costs associated with our international operations are typically higher than those
associated with our U.S. operations, resulting in decreased operating margins in some foreign countries.

•

Credit and Access to Capital Risks.

Our international customers could have reduced access to working capital due to higher interest
rates, reduced bank lending resulting from contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer’s or its bank’s financial condition, or the inability to access other financing.



Political Risks Associated with International Operations—Our international operations subject
us to risks related to political unrest and terrorism.

We have manufacturing facilities in parts of the world that periodically experience political unrest, with Thailand being a recent example. This could disrupt our ability to manufacture important components as well as cause interruptions
and/or delays in our ability to ship components to other locations for continued manufacture and assembly. Any such delays or interruptions could result in delays in our ability to fill orders and have an adverse effect on our results of operation
and financial condition. U.S. and international responses to the ongoing hostilities in Afghanistan and Iraq and the risk of terrorist attacks or hostilities elsewhere in the world could exacerbate these risks.

Legal and Operational Risks Associated with International
Operations—Our international operations subject us to risks related to staffing and management, legal and regulatory requirements and the protection of intellectual property.

Operating outside of the United States creates difficulties associated with
staffing and managing our international manufacturing facilities, complying with local legal and regulatory requirements and protecting our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance
with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject. We also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified.

SOX 404 Compliance—While we believe that we currently have
adequate internal control procedures in place, we are still exposed to future risks of non-compliance and will continue to incur costs associated with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

We have completed the evaluation of our internal controls over financial
reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although our assessment, testing, and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of June 27, 2008, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we
cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. If our internal controls are ineffective in future periods, our financial results or the market price of our shares could be adversely affected. We will incur additional expenses and
commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations.

Volatile Public Markets—The price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly.

The stock market in general, and the market for technology stocks in particular, has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the
operating performance of companies. If these market or industry-based fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance, and you could lose all or a substantial
part of your investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including among others:

•

actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;

•

announcements of innovations, new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors, including those competitors who offer alternative storage
technology solutions;

•

our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts;

•

the timing of announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;

•

general stock market conditions;

•

the occurrence of major catastrophic events;

•

changes in financial estimates by investment research analysts; and

•

the sale of our common shares held by certain equity investors or members of management.



Failure to Pay Quarterly Dividends—Our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our common
shareholders could cause the market price of our common shares to decline significantly.

On July 15, 2008, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share that will be paid on or before August 15, 2008 to our common shareholders
of record as of August 1, 2008.

Our ability to pay
quarterly dividends will be subject to, among other things, general business conditions within the disc drive industry, our financial results, the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings, and legal and contractual restrictions on the
payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our common shareholders, including restrictions imposed by the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. Any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause
the market price of our common shares to decline significantly. Our payment of dividends to holders of our common shares may in certain future quarters result in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes
due August 2012. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly dividends is reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying dividends at historical levels could result in a persistently low market valuation of our common shares.

Potential Governmental Action—Governmental action
against companies located in offshore jurisdictions may lead to a reduction in the demand for our common shares.

Recent federal and state legislation has been proposed, and additional legislation may be proposed in the future which, if enacted, could have an adverse
tax impact on either Seagate or its shareholders. For example, the eligibility for favorable tax treatment of taxable distributions paid to U.S. shareholders of Seagate as qualified dividends could be eliminated.

Securities Litigation—Significant fluctuations in the market price
of our common shares could result in securities class action claims against us.

Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of disc drive companies and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile
in the future. In the past, following periods of decline in the market price of a company’s securities, class action lawsuits have often been pursued against that company. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in
substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Current Global Credit and Financial Market Conditions—Current global credit and financial market conditions could
negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term investments, or auction rate securities and our ability to meet our financing objectives.

Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at
the time of purchase. Our short-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase.

The recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors, including us, from liquidating
auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale at auction has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities. During the quarter ended June 27, 2008, all $31 million of our auction rate securities
continued to fail at auction. As a result we recorded a temporary unrealized loss of $3 million to other comprehensive income. We will continue to analyze our auction rate securities each reporting period for impairment as we may be required to
record an impairment charge if in the future we determine that there is a decline in the fair value which is other than temporary.

While as of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any other downgrades, losses, failed auctions or other significant deterioration in the fair
value of our cash equivalents or short-term investments since June 27, 2008,



no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current
portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term investments or auction rate securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives.

Dividends

We are
currently paying our shareholders a quarterly dividend of no more than $0.12 per share (up to $0.48 per share annually) so long as the aggregate amount of the dividend does not exceed 50% of our cumulative consolidated net income plus 100% of net
cash proceeds received from the issuance of capital, all of which are measured from the period beginning June 30, 2001 and ending the most recent fiscal quarter in which financial statements are internally available.

We are restricted in our ability to pay dividends by the covenants contained
in our revolving credit facility. Our declaration of dividends is also subject to Cayman Islands law and the discretion of our board of directors. Under the terms of the Seagate Technology shareholders agreement (which was amended on
September 2, 2004) at least seven members of our board of directors must approve the payment of dividends in excess of 15% of our net income in the prior fiscal year (provided that such consent is not required to declare and pay our
regular quarterly dividend of up to $0.12 per share). In deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends, our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry, our financial results,
our capital requirements, contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors
may deem relevant.



Since the closing of our initial public offering in December 2002, we have paid dividends, pursuant to
our quarterly dividend policy totaling approximately $820 million in the aggregate. The following are dividends paid in the last two fiscal years:

Because we had current
earnings and profits in excess of distributions for our taxable year ended June 27, 2008, distributions on our common shares to U.S. shareholders during this period were treated as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
We anticipate that we will have earnings and profits in excess of distributions in fiscal year 2009. Therefore, distributions to U.S. shareholders in fiscal year 2009 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Non-U.S. shareholders should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax treatment.

Repurchases of Our Equity Securities

During fiscal year 2008, we repurchased approximately 65 million common shares through open market repurchases at an average price of $22.89 for a
total of approximately $1.5 billion. Of this amount, we repurchased approximately $974 million under the $2.5 billion August 2006 stock repurchase plan and approximately $500 million under a new plan announced on February 4, 2008, to repurchase
up to an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common shares over 24 months.

As of June 27, 2008, we had no amounts remaining under the August 2006 stock repurchase plan and had approximately $2.0 billion remaining under the February 2008 stock repurchase plan. Share repurchases
during fiscal year 2008 were as follows:

Our Company

We are the world’s leading provider of hard disc drives, based on revenue and units shipped. We design, manufacture, market and sell hard disc
drives. Hard disc drives, commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives, are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters or discs with magnetic surfaces. The performance attributes of disc drives, including their cost
effectiveness and high storage capacities has resulted in disc drives being used as the primary medium for storing electronic data in systems ranging from desktop and notebook computers, and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering
electronic data over corporate networks and the Internet.

We
produce a broad range of disc drive products addressing enterprise applications, where our products are used in enterprise servers, mainframes and workstations; desktop applications, where our products are used in desktop computers; mobile computing
applications, where our products are used in notebook computers; and consumer electronics applications, where our products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs), gaming devices and other consumer electronic
devices that require storage. We also sell our branded storage solutions under both the Seagate and Maxtor brands. In addition to manufacturing and selling disc drives, we provide data storage services for small- to medium-sized businesses,
including online backup, data protection and recovery solutions.

We sell our disc drives primarily to major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and we also market to distributors and retailers under our globally recognized brand names. We have longstanding relationships with



many of our OEM customers including Hewlett-Packard, Dell, EMC, IBM and Lenovo. We also have key relationships with major distributors, who sell our disc
drive products to small OEMs, dealers, system integrators and retailers throughout most of the world. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.

The following table summarizes our disc drive revenue from sales to OEMs, distributors and retailers:

The only customer
exceeding 10% of our disc drive revenue for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 was Hewlett-Packard. Dell exceeded 10% of our disc drive revenue in fiscal years 2008 and 2006.

Industry Overview

Our industry is characterized by several trends that have a material impact on our strategic planning, financial condition and results of operations.

Disc Drive Industry Consolidation

Due to the significant challenges posed by the need to continually innovate
and improve manufacturing efficiency and because of the increasing amounts of capital and research and development investments required, the disc drive industry has undergone significant consolidation as disc drive manufacturers and component
manufacturers merged with other companies or exited the industry. Through such combinations, disc drive manufacturers have also become increasingly vertically integrated. While recent combinations have limited the opportunity for additional industry
consolidation, the increasing technological challenges, associated levels of investment and competitive necessity of large-scale operations, may still drive future industry consolidation. Additionally, we may in the future face indirect competition
from present and potential customers who from time to time evaluate whether to offer electronic data storage products that may compete with our products.

Price Erosion

Our industry has been characterized by continuous price erosion for disc drive products with comparable capacity, performance and feature sets (i.e.,
“like-for-like products”). Price erosion for like-for-like products (“price erosion”) is more pronounced during periods of:

•

industry consolidation in which competitors aggressively use discounted price to gain market share;

•

few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings;

•

temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand; and

•

seasonally weaker demand, which may cause excess supply.

Disc drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disc drive products characterized by higher capacity, better
performance and additional feature sets and/or product cost reductions.



We expect price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable future. To remain competitive,
we believe it will be necessary to continue to reduce prices as well as introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of our competitors in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced
cost structure on these new products.

Disc Drive Industry
Demand Trends

We believe that the disc drive industry is
experiencing the following demand trends:

We believe that
technological advances in storage technology and a proliferation of non-compute applications is increasingly driving the broad, global proliferation of digital content through the creation, sharing, aggregation, distribution, consumption and
protection of all types of digital content. We believe that growth in digital content is being driven by increases in media-rich as well as user generated content, the digitization of content previously stored in analog format and the duplication of
content in multiple locations. As a result of these factors, the nature and amount of content being created requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store, manage, distribute, back up and use such content.

We believe that demand for electronic data storage in the enterprise and
traditional compute markets continues to grow as increasing legal and regulatory requirements and changes in the nature and amount of data being stored has necessitated additional storage. Additionally, the proliferation of digital content in the
consumer space has resulted in additional demand for storage by enterprises, including those that host, aggregate, distribute or share such content.

•

Disc Drives for Mobile Computing.

The mobile computing market is growing faster than the market for desktop computers as price and
performance continue to improve. Notebook systems are increasingly becoming the preference for both consumers and enterprises as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance. We estimate that in fiscal year 2008,
industry shipments of disc drives for mobile compute applications grew approximately 45% from fiscal year 2007.

The disc drive industry has recently seen the introduction of alternative technologies that directly compete with mobile disc drives. For example, certain
manufacturers have introduced solid state drives (SSDs), using flash memory technology, which is an alternative to disc drives in certain applications. Due to the high capital requirements and capacity required to manufacture flash memory, we
believe the perceived benefits of SSDs are not currently realized at an attractive cost relative to hard disc drives, particularly in higher capacity applications. We believe that the market for these alternative technologies is still developing and
because of the current high cost per gigabyte of these storage solutions, we do not expect these solutions to have a significant near-term impact on the overall market for disc drives for mobile computing.

•

Disc Drives for Enterprise Storage.

The need to address the expansion in data storage management requirements has increased the demand
for new hardware storage solutions for both mission critical and business critical enterprise storage.

Mission critical enterprise storage is defined by the use of high performance, high capacity disc drives for use in applications which are vital to the
operation of enterprises. We expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to grow, driven by many enterprises continuing to move network traffic to dedicated storage area networks (SANs). In addition, many enterprises are
moving away from the use of server-attached storage to network-attached storage (NAS). Both of these solutions are comprised principally of high performance, high capacity disc drives with sophisticated software and communications technologies. In
addition, many enterprises are also consolidating data centers, aiming to increase speed and reliability within a smaller space, reducing network complexity and increasing energy savings, which has led to an increased demand for more energy
efficient, small form factor disc drives. SSD storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system



startup or boot disc drives. In addition, enterprises are considering the use of SSDs in applications where rapid processing is required for high volume
transaction data. The timing of the adoption of SSDs in these applications is currently unknown as enterprises weigh the cost benefits of mission critical enterprise disc drives relative to the perceived performance benefits of SSDs.

Business critical enterprise storage is an emerging and growing application
in enterprise storage whereby enterprises are using higher capacity disc drives to store less frequently accessed, less time-critical, but capacity-intensive data. Because of recent decreases in cost per gigabyte, business critical electronic data
which historically has been stored on tape or other backup and archival technologies are now being stored on these high capacity disc drives. In the long-term, however, we believe that this trend towards business critical systems that utilize high
capacity, enterprise class serial advanced technology architecture (SATA) and serial attached small computer system interface (SAS) will, in addition to expanding the overall enterprise market, likely shift some demand from disc drives used in
traditional mission critical enterprise storage.

•

Disc Drives for Branded Solutions

.    We believe that the proliferation of media-rich digital content has increased consumer demand for
storage to augment their current desktop or notebook disc drive capacities. Consumers are also using external branded storage solutions to backup and secure data in case of disaster or system failure.

•

Disc Drives for Desktop Computing.

We believe growth in disc drives for desktop computing has moderated, in part due to the growth in
demand for notebook computers, particularly in developed countries. We believe that current growth in demand for disc drives in desktop computing is focused on developing markets where price remains a primary consideration. Demand for inexpensive,
high capacity external storage has also driven growth of 3.5-inch desktop disc drives.

•

Disc Drives for Consumer Electronics.

Disc drives in the consumer electronics (CE) markets are primarily used in high-capacity
solutions, such as DVRs, that require more storage capability than can be provided in a cost-effective manner through alternative technologies such as flash memory, which is used in lower capacity CE applications. We believe the demand for disc
drives in CE will become more pronounced with the increased amount of high definition content that requires larger amounts of storage capacity. Although solid state or flash memory has largely replaced disc drives in handheld applications, we
believe that the demand for disc drives to store, hold or back up related media content from such handheld devices, continues to grow.

We believe that for some of the fastest growing applications described above, the demand is focused on higher capacity disc drive products.

Product Life Cycles and Changing Technology

Our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology,
which have contributed to rapid product life cycles. As a result, success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the first-to-market with new products, allowing those disc drive manufacturers who introduce new
products first to sell those products at a premium until comparable products are introduced. Also, because our industry is characterized by continuous price erosion, the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated the need to quickly
achieve product cost effectiveness. Changing technology also necessitates the need for on-going investments in research and development, which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles. Further, there is a continued need to
successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions, as factors such as quality, reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance.

Seasonality

The disc drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year.
This seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the back-to-school season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter. In



addition, corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year when IT budget calendars provide for more spending. We expect the
disc drive industry to experience normal seasonal patterns of increased demand for the September 2008 quarter.

Recording Heads and Media

Due to industry consolidation there are limited number of independent suppliers of recording heads and media available to disc drive manufacturers. As a
result, vertically integrated disc drive manufacturers, who manufacture their own recording heads and media, are less dependent on external supply of recording heads and media than less vertically integrated disc drive manufacturers. While we
believe that there is adequate supply to meet currently identified industry demand, these consolidations may limit the supply of recording heads and media from independent suppliers in the long-term.

Commodity and Other Manufacturing Costs

The production of disc drives requires precious metals, scarce alloys and
industrial commodities, that are subject to fluctuations in prices, and the supply of which has at times been constrained. Recent increases in the price of many commodities have resulted in higher costs of materials used in the manufacture of disc
drive products. Additionally, adverse economic conditions such as rising fuel costs may further increase commodity, manufacturing and freight costs. Should the disc drive industry not be able to pass these costs onto customers, gross margins may be
impacted.

Industry Supply Balance

Historically, the industry has from time to time experienced periods of
imbalances between supply and demand. To the extent that the disc drive industry builds capacity and products based on expectations of demand that do not materialize, there may be an oversupply of products that could lead to increased price erosion.
Conversely, during periods where demand exceeds supply, price erosion is generally more benign. The industry, excluding Seagate, exited the June 2008 quarter with what we believe to be approximately five weeks of distribution inventory in the
desktop channel, which is consistent with historical seasonal patterns.

Seagate Overview

We are the world’s
leading provider of hard disc drives, based on revenue and units shipped. Our products address the enterprise, desktop, mobile computing and CE and branded solutions storage markets. The Seagate 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch disc drive units used in our
branded storage products are reported in the desktop and mobile market information, respectively. We maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to
our products, such as read/write heads and recording media. We believe that our control of these key technologies, combined with our platform design and manufacturing, will enable us to achieve product performance, time-to-market leadership and
manufacturing flexibility, which will allow us to respond to customers and market opportunities. Our technology ownership, combined with our integrated design and manufacturing approach, has allowed us to effectively leverage our leadership in
traditional computing to enter new markets with only incremental product development and manufacturing costs.

Maxtor Acquisition

During fiscal year 2007, we completed our integration of Maxtor, including customer and product transitions where we replaced Maxtor designed disc drive
products with Seagate designed disc drive products. Our fiscal year 2007 included Maxtor’s operating losses largely recognized during the first half of fiscal year 2007 as we transitioned Maxtor products to Seagate products and acquisition and
integration related charges recognized over the entire fiscal year. We expect to continue to incur charges, the most significant of which are expected to be the amortization of acquired intangible assets.



Operating Performance

•

Revenue

—Revenue in fiscal year 2008 rose to approximately $12.7 billion, driven by growth in the number of units shipped as a result of the
continued growth in digital content and the resulting increase in demand for storage and customer acceptance of our new products. The increase in the number of units shipped and an improved mix of products shipped was partially offset by price
erosion, which was relatively benign during the first half of the fiscal year as a result of favorable industry conditions, including well-balanced disc drive supply and demand, while being more pronounced during the second half of fiscal year 2008,
as is consistent with historical seasonal patterns.

•

Enterprise

—During fiscal year 2008, we believe we extended our leadership position in the enterprise market, shipping 20.3 million units, an
increase of 22% from 16.7 million units in fiscal year 2007. The increase in the number of units shipped was primarily attributable to an increase in market demand for mission critical enterprise disc drives as server virtualization resulted in
increased demand for 3.5-inch high-speed, high-capacity products in server-attached storage applications. Additionally, our sales of small form factor mission critical enterprise disc drives increased 80% to 7.2 million units as compared to
fiscal year 2007. Our increased shipments resulted in our market share growth, which combined with an improved product mix, was partially offset by price erosion.

•

Mobile

—In fiscal year 2008, we believe the overall mobile compute market grew approximately 45% from fiscal year 2007, with Seagate shipping
26.7 million units, an increase of 38% over fiscal year 2007. The increase in unit shipments from the prior fiscal year was driven by what we believe to be a continuing trend of notebooks systems increasingly becoming the preference for both
consumers and enterprises as the need for mobility increases and wireless adoption continues to advance. Also, we saw an increase in the use of our mobile products in branded storage products. Our slower than market growth was mainly attributable to
delayed product introductions allowing our competitors to capture additional market share during the year. In addition, the storage capacities for our mobile compute disc drive shipments are trending higher as notebooks are increasingly displacing
desktop computers in the home. These increases in units shipped and a favorable product mix were offset by particularly pronounced price erosion.

•

Desktop

—In fiscal year 2008, we believe we maintained our market leadership position with shipments of 111 million units, an increase of 13% over
fiscal year 2007. This increase was mainly driven by increased demand for our desktop products, particularly in our higher capacities for 3.5-inch desktop products. We believe this demand is driven by the continued growth in digital content and the
resulting increase in overall demand for desktop storage products and the use of our desktop disc drives in our branded storage products. This increase in demand and favorable product mix was offset by price erosion. In the global distribution
channel, we exited the June 2008 quarter with distribution channel inventory for desktop products at approximately four weeks.

•

Consumer

—In fiscal year 2008, we shipped a total of 24.6 million units in the CE market, a decrease of 3% from fiscal year 2007. This decrease was
mainly attributable to a decrease of 36% in gaming units shipped compared to fiscal year 2007, only partially offset by a 33% increase in DVR shipments. We believe that increased penetration of DVRs in the home has resulted in incremental demand for
disc drives for these applications. We believe the decreased demand for disc drives used in gaming applications has been due in part to some new gaming platforms not utilizing a disc drive and our decision to reduce participation in this market.

Other factors affecting
income

—In fiscal year 2008, our operating results included an expense of $262 million related to variable performance-based compensation, as compared to none in fiscal year 2007. During fiscal year 2008, we recorded restructuring costs of
approximately $50 million related to the closure of our Limavady, Northern Ireland operations and approximately $19 million related to the closure of our Milpitas, California operations.



Seasonality

Historically, we have exhibited seasonally lower unit demand during the second half of each fiscal year, however, there were
some recent quarters in fiscal year 2006 in which these seasonal trends were moderated. We saw a return to traditional seasonality in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008. For the September 2008 quarter, we expect to see demand in the desktop,
mobile and CE markets to be seasonally higher than the June 2008 quarter, while we expect demand in the enterprise market to be flat to slightly up compared to the June 2008 quarter.

Recording Heads and Media

The percentage of our requirements for recording media that we produce internally varies from quarter to quarter. Our long-term strategy is to
externally purchase approximately 10% of total recording media requirements. In July 2008, we announced the proposed closure of our recording media manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. The closure is part of our ongoing focus on
cost-efficiencies in all areas of our business. We plan to cease production at the Milpitas manufacturing facility in October 2008. We are continuing to expand our recording media production facilities in Singapore. We expect meaningful output from
our new media facility in Singapore beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and we believe we will have adequate internal and external supply plans in place to support our requirements. Similar to our long-term strategy on recording media
supply, our future plans include the evaluation and external purchase of up to 10% of recording heads requirements.

We purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties (mainly in Japan), which are used to manufacture our disc drives for mobile and small form
factor CE products. Historically, we purchase approximately 70% of our aluminum substrates for recording media production from third parties. In December 2007, we announced the proposed closure of our substrate manufacturing facility in Limavady,
Northern Ireland. The proposed closure is part of our ongoing focus on cost-efficiencies in all areas of our business. We plan to cease production at our Limavady facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. We are in the process of adding
an aluminum substrate manufacturing facility in Johor, Malaysia which will allow us to be more cost competitive and position us for future expansion, and reduce our external substrate purchases to approximately 50%. We expect meaningful output from
our Johor facility in during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Commodity and Other Manufacturing Costs

The
production of disc drives requires precious metals, scarce alloys and industrial commodities, that are subject to fluctuations in prices, and the supply of which has at times been constrained. Recent increases in the price of many commodities have
resulted in higher material costs for our products. Additionally, adverse economic conditions such as rising fuel costs may further increase our costs related to commodities, manufacturing and freight. Should we not be able to pass these increased
costs onto our customers, our gross margins may be impacted.

In order to mitigate susceptibility to these conditions, we may maintain increased inventory of precious metals, scarce alloys and industrial commodities. In addition, we have increased our use of ocean shipments to help offset the increase
in freight costs.

Capital Investments

In fiscal year 2008, we made $930 million of capital investments,
$293 million of which we incurred in the June 2008 quarter. For fiscal year 2009, we expect approximately $1 billion in capital investment will be required to ensure continued alignment of our manufacturing capacity with customer demand
and to finish our planned recording media and substrate capacity expansions in Asia, while we continue to improve our use of capital equipment.

Revenue growth in
fiscal year 2008 reflected a 15% growth in the number of disc drives shipped. We believe unit growth was driven by continued growth in digital content, the resulting increase in demand for storage and customer acceptance of our new products.
Industry disc drive demand across all markets grew by



18% from fiscal year 2007, with our share of the desktop and enterprise markets increasing by 5% and 6%, respectively, while our share of the mobile compute
and consumer electronic markets declined by 6% and 10%, respectively. The increase in the number of units shipped and an improved mix of products shipped was partially offset by price erosion, which was relatively benign during the first half of the
fiscal year as a result of favorable industry conditions, including well-balanced disc drive supply and demand, while being more pronounced during the second half of fiscal year 2008, as is consistent with historical seasonal patterns.

Our overall average sales price per unit (ASP) for our products was $68
for fiscal year 2008, down from $71 in fiscal year 2007, as an improved mix of products shipped was more than offset by price erosion.

Unit shipments for our products in fiscal year 2008 were as follows:

•

Enterprise—20.3 million, up from 16.7 million units in fiscal year 2007.

•

Mobile—26.7 million, up from 19.4 million units in fiscal year 2007.

•

Desktop—111 million, up from 97.8 million units in fiscal year 2007.

•

Consumer—24.6 million, down from 25.3 million units in fiscal year 2007.

We maintain various sales programs such as point-of-sale rebates, sales price
adjustments and price protection, aimed at increasing customer demand. We exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels, sales program participation and customer claims submittals in
determining the provision for such programs. Sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately 9% of our gross revenue, for both fiscal years 2008 and 2007.

Cost of Revenue

For fiscal year 2008,
cost of revenue increased due to a higher number of units shipped and a higher mix of products with higher average capacities, feature sets, and performance, partially offset by a 10% decline in the average cost per unit. The average cost per unit
reduction was impacted by the more efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity resulting from increased demand and the completed integration of Maxtor, transitions to more cost effective products, and the elimination of lower margin Maxtor
designed products. The lower cost per unit combined with increased number of units shipped and improved mix of higher margin products resulted in gross margin improvement, which was partially offset by price erosion.

During fiscal year
2008, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $88 million, comprised mainly of restructuring charges related to the planned closures of our Limavady, Northern Ireland and our Milpitas, California operations.

The restructuring charges associated with the Limavady facility were
primarily related to employee termination costs of approximately $29 million and approximately $18 million related to expected grant repayments. We plan to cease production at our Limavady facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and
expect all activities related to this closure to be complete by the second half of fiscal year 2009. We expect additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million to be recorded primarily over the next two quarters, resulting in aggregate
restructuring charges of approximately $60 million to $65 million.

We recorded approximately $19 million in restructuring charges associated with employee termination costs related to the planned closure of our media manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. We plan to cease production at our
Milpitas facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and expect all activities related to this closure to be complete by the second half of fiscal year 2009. We expect additional restructuring charges of approximately $17 million to be
recorded primarily over the next two quarters, resulting in an aggregate restructuring charge of approximately $36 million. In addition, as a result of the planned closure of the Milpitas facility, the Company expects approximately $38 million
relating to accelerated asset depreciation to be recorded to cost of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.

The remaining restructuring and other charges were primarily comprised of employee termination costs as a result of plans to continue the alignment of our
global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements around the world. We expect these restructuring activities to be completed by the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.

We recorded a
provision for income taxes of $67 million for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2008 compared to a benefit from income taxes of $352 million for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007. We are a foreign holding company incorporated in the Cayman
Islands with foreign and U.S. subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we
operate under in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland and Thailand. These tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020.

Our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2008 differs from the provision for income
taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs, (ii) a decrease in
our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, and (iii) tax expense related to intercompany transactions. Our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007 differed from the provision for income
taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and (ii) the tax benefit related to
the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs.

Based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to (i) potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and (ii) limitations imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (“IRC
Section 382”) on usage of certain tax attributes (further described below), we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Dividend distributions received from our
U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes when and if distributed. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the Cayman
Islands or U.S. federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company.

As of June 27, 2008, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded was $433 million. Approximately $22 million of this amount relates to deferred tax assets acquired in the Maxtor acquisition for which the
related benefit will be credited directly to goodwill when and if realized. The net increase in the valuation allowance in



fiscal year 2008 was $34 million. In fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the valuation allowance decreased by $580 million and increased by $327 million
respectively. The fiscal year 2007 valuation allowance release was largely due to the completion during 2007 of the restructuring of the Company’s intercompany arrangements, which enables the Company to forecast future U.S. taxable income with
greater certainty and U.S. taxable income from the intercompany sale of certain Maxtor assets.

As of June 27, 2008, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $890 million. The realization of $808 million of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient U.S. and certain
foreign taxable income in future periods. Although realization is not assured, we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, may increase
or decrease, when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and certain foreign taxable income.

As a result of the Maxtor acquisition, Maxtor underwent a change in ownership within the meaning of IRC Section 382 on May 19, 2006. In general,
IRC Section 382 places annual limitations on the use of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at the ownership change date. As of June 27, 2008, $ 1.3 billion and $337 million of U.S.
federal and state net operating losses, respectively, and $36 million of tax credit carryovers acquired from Maxtor are generally subject to an annual limitation of approximately $110 million. Certain amounts may be accelerated into the first five
years following the acquisition pursuant to IRC Section 382 and published notices.

On January 3, 2005, we underwent a change in ownership under IRC Section 382 due to the sale of common shares to the public by our then largest shareholder, New SAC. Based on an independent valuation as of
January 3, 2005, the annual limitation for this change is $44.8 million. As of June 27, 2008, there were $453 million of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and $110 million of U.S. tax credit carryforwards subject to IRC
Section 382 limitation associated with the January 3, 2005 change. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets associated with tax attributes subject to this IRC Section 382 limitation will not be
realized, a valuation allowance has been provided.

Effective
at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two-step
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement (SFAS) No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS No. 109). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition
by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax
benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we increased our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption. We accounted for the
increase primarily as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $3 million and an increase to goodwill of $25 million. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the
date of adoption was $385 million excluding interest and penalties. At June 27, 2008, we had approximately $374 million in total unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties. The total unrecognized tax benefits that, if
recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $63 million and $75 million as of June 29, 2007 and June 27, 2008, respectively.

Our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations did not change as a result of implementing the provisions of FIN 48. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, we had accrued approximately $19 million for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. This
accrual increased by $3 million to approximately $22 million as of June 27, 2008.



During the 12 months ending June 27, 2008, we recognized a previously unrecognized tax benefit of
approximately $13 million related to the recognition of foreign uncertain tax benefits as a result of new information obtained during the year. We also recognized a previously unrecognized tax benefit of approximately $9 million for foreign
uncertain tax benefits resulting in a reduction of the Maxtor goodwill as a result of the expiration of certain foreign statutes of limitation for pre-acquisition periods.

During the 12 months beginning June 28, 2008, we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $21 million as a
result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the resolution or timing of closure on open audits
are highly uncertain as to when these events occur.

We file
U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. The statutes of limitation for U.S. federal returns are open for fiscal year 2003 and forward. The Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of fiscal years ending in 2003 and 2004. For
state and foreign tax returns, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2001.

Fiscal Year 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year 2006

The fiscal year 2007 results include the results of Maxtor for the entire year, while fiscal year 2006 include the results of Maxtor from May 19,
2006 to June 30, 2006. In connection with the Maxtor acquisition, we incurred a number of accounting charges and other costs, which impacted our earnings for the entire fiscal year 2007 and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.

The increase in
revenue from fiscal year 2006 was driven by a 34% increase in the unit volume of disc drives shipped from 118.7 million units to 159.2 million units principally as a result of the retention of a portion of Maxtor’s market share,
offset by a 9% reduction in our average sales price from $78 to $71 per unit and a weaker than anticipated demand for large capacity 3.5-inch ATA disc drives. The comparative decrease in average sales price per unit in the period resulted from price
erosion that more than offset improved product mix.

Unit
shipments for our products in fiscal year 2007 were as follows:

•

Enterprise—16.7 million, up from 14.3 million units in fiscal year 2006.

•

Mobile—19.4 million, up from 12.5 million units in fiscal year 2006.

•

Desktop—97.8 million, up from 73.8 million units in fiscal year 2006.

•

Consumer—25.3 million, up from 18.1 million units in fiscal year 2006.

We maintain various sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. We
exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels, sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs. During fiscal year 2007, sales
programs recorded as contra revenue, were approximately 9% of our gross revenue, compared to 7% of our gross revenue for fiscal year 2006. The increase in sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue from fiscal year 2006 was primarily the result
of a higher mix of sales to distributors and retail customers which generally require higher program support than OEM sales and to a more aggressive pricing environment. Point-of-sale rebates, sales price adjustments and price protection accounted
for a substantial portion of the increase in sales programs.



Cost of Revenue

The increase in cost
of revenue for fiscal year 2007 was principally as a result of the acquisition of Maxtor. The gross margin percentage decrease from fiscal year 2006 was due to the sale of lower margin Maxtor designed products during the first six months of fiscal
year 2007; costs and charges related to our acquisition of Maxtor during fiscal year 2007 (including integration and retention costs of $54 million, stock-based compensation of $27 million, amortization of existing technology of
$150 million, and an $18 million accrual for the settlement of customer compensatory claims associated with quality issues related to legacy Maxtor products shipped prior to the closing of the Maxtor acquisition); and an aggressive pricing
environment in fiscal year 2007, particularly in the high capacity 3.5-inch and mobile markets in the first half of the year, and the low end OEM desktop and mobile markets in the second half. These effects were partially offset by the elimination
of variable performance-based compensation for fiscal year 2007, compared to an expense of $76 million recorded in Cost of revenue in fiscal year 2006.

We recorded a benefit
from income taxes of $352 million for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007 compared to a provision for income taxes of $84 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. We are a foreign holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands
with foreign and U.S. subsidiaries that operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate
under in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland and Thailand. These tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various



dates through 2020. Our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007 differed from the provision for income taxes that
would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and (ii) the tax benefit related to the
aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs. Our provision for income taxes recorded for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional U.S. 35% rate to
income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of (i) the tax benefit related to the aforementioned tax holidays and tax incentive programs, (ii) an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, and
(iii) utilization of research tax credits generated in that year.

Based on our foreign ownership structure and subject to (i) potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and (ii) limitations imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (“IRC
Section 382”) on usage of certain tax attributes, we anticipated that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Dividend distributions received from our U.S. subsidiaries may be
subject to U.S. withholding taxes when and if distributed. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the Cayman Islands or
U.S. federal income tax if remitted to our foreign parent holding company.

During fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, we reduced our valuation allowance recorded in prior years for our deferred tax assets by $641 million. This release of valuation allowance was largely due to the
completion during fiscal 2007 of the restructuring of our intercompany arrangements, which enabled us to forecast our U.S. profits with greater certainty and the recording of a U.S. taxable gain in connection with the intercompany sale of certain
Maxtor intangible assets as described below. As a result of the valuation allowance release, we recorded a U.S. deferred tax benefit of $319 million and a $322 million reduction in the goodwill originally recorded in connection with the Maxtor
acquisition. The reduction in goodwill was required in accordance with SFAS No. 109 as a result of the reversal of valuation allowance that had been previously recorded as of the date of acquisition against Maxtor related deferred tax assets
primarily for tax net operating loss carryovers. The valuation allowance was reduced primarily to reflect the realization of acquired Maxtor net operating loss carryforwards due to increased forecasts of future U.S. taxable income and a $296 million
gain for U.S. tax purposes from the intercompany sale of certain intellectual property rights to a foreign subsidiary. Approximately $120 million of tax expense associated with the gain on the intercompany sale of intangibles has been capitalized in
accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

(ARB No. 51) and is being amortized to income tax expense over a sixty-month period, which approximates the expected useful life of the
intangibles sold in the intercompany transaction.

As of
June 29, 2007, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $768 million, the realization of $663 million of which is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. Although realization is not assured, we
believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters, when we reevaluate our estimates of future
taxable income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following is a discussion of our principal liquidity requirements and
capital resources.

We had approximately $1.1 billion in
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at June 27, 2008, which includes $990 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was flat from fiscal year 2007. During fiscal year 2008, cash provided by operating activities and cash
provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases were offset by capital expenditures, the repurchase of our common shares, dividends paid to shareholders and the acquisition of MetaLINCS, Inc. (“MetaLINCS”).



In September 2006, Seagate Technology HDD Holdings (“HDD”), our wholly-owned direct subsidiary
issued senior notes totaling $1.5 billion comprised of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due October 2009 (the “2009 Notes”), $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior
Notes due October 2011 (the “2011 Notes”) and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.800% Senior Notes due October 2016 (the “2016 Notes”). The notes are guaranteed by Seagate Technology on a full and
unconditional basis.

As of June 27, 2008, we held auction
rate securities in the amount of $31 million, all of which are collateralized by pools of student loans guaranteed by the Federal Family Education Loan Program. During the fiscal 2008 year, these securities failed to settle at auction and as a
result we recorded an unrealized loss of $3 million and reclassified the securities to long-term investments.

At June 27, 2008, our exposure to sub-prime mortgage securities was not significant. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any
downgrades, losses, or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or short-term investments since June 27, 2008.

Until required for other purposes, our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less
at the time of purchase. Our short-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss
and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We mitigate default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in diversified, high-quality investment grade securities with limited time to
maturity. We monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository. We intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in
those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets. We operate in some countries that may have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash and/or foreign exchange across their borders. These restrictions have
not impeded our ability to conduct business in those countries, nor do we expect them to in the next 12 months.

The following table summarizes results of statement of cash flows for the periods indicated:

Cash Provided by Operating
Activities

Cash provided by operating activities for
fiscal year 2008 was approximately $2.5 billion and included the effects of:

•

net income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation;

•

an increase of $351 million in accounts payable, primarily as a result of outsourcing the manufacture of certain sub-assemblies to third parties;

•

an increase of $238 million in vendor non-trade receivables, primarily as a result of outsourcing the manufacture of certain sub-assemblies to third parties (see
Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);

•

an increase of $151 million in inventories, principally raw materials and finished goods; and

•

an increase of $154 million in accrued expenses, employee compensation and warranty.



Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2007 was approximately $943 million and
included the effects of:

•

net income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and tax benefits related to a change in our valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets;

•

a decrease of $391 million in accounts payable;

•

a decrease of $465 million in accrued expenses, employee compensation and warranty. A large part of this increase was due to variable performance-based compensation
earned during fiscal year 2006 and paid in fiscal year 2007;

•

the payment of accrued exit costs and retention bonuses related to the Maxtor acquisition; and

•

a reduction of $106 million in inventories.

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2006 was approximately $1.5 billion and included the effects of:

•

net income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation;

•

increases of $190 million in accounts receivable and $113 million in inventories; and

•

increases of $91 million in accounts payable and $120 million in accrued expenses, employee compensation and warranty.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

During fiscal year 2008, we used $991 million for net cash investing
activities, which was primarily attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately $930 million and $74 million for the acquisition of MetaLINCS. The approximately $930 million we invested
in property, equipment and leasehold improvements was primarily comprised of:

•

$88 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and test facilities in the Far East;

•

$490 million to upgrade and expansion of our recording media operations in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore;

•

$184 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for our recording head operations in the United States, the Far East and Northern Ireland;

•

$65 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for alternative technologies in the United States; and

•

$103 million for research and development, information technology infrastructure and other facilities and equipment costs.

During fiscal year 2007, we used $402 million for net cash investing
activities, which was primarily attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately $906 million and $178 million (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of EVault, partially offset by
$675 million of maturities and sales of short-term investments in excess of purchases of short-term investments. The approximately $906 million we invested in property, equipment and leasehold improvements was primarily comprised of:

•

$192 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and test facilities in the Far East;

•

$414 million to upgrade and expansion of our recording media operations in the United States, Singapore and Northern Ireland;



•

$167 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for our recording head operations in the United States, the Far East and Northern Ireland;

•

$20 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for alternative technologies in the United States; and

•

$113 million for research and development, information technology infrastructure and other facilities and equipment costs.

During fiscal year 2006, we used $561 million for net cash investing
activities, which was primarily attributable to expenditures for property, equipment and leasehold improvements partially offset by the maturities and sales of short-term investments in excess of purchases thereof, as well as net cash acquired from
Maxtor. Specifically, during fiscal year 2006, we invested approximately $1.0 billion in property, equipment and leasehold improvements primarily comprised of:

•

$376 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to our subassembly and disc drive final assembly and test facilities in the Far East;

•

$143 million to upgrade and expansion of our recording media operations in the United States, Singapore and Northern Ireland;

•

$337 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for our recording head operations in the United States, the Far East and Northern Ireland;

•

$10 million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for alternative technologies in the United States; and

•

$142 million for research and development, information technology infrastructure, as well as Maxtor and other facilities and equipment costs.

During fiscal years 2006 through 2008, we
increased capacity to support increased unit shipments and additional capacity for the ramp-up and production of Seagate-designed disc drive products to replace legacy Maxtor-designed products and to continue with our planned media and substrate
capacity expansions in Asia. For fiscal year 2009, we expect approximately $1 billion in capital investment will be required to ensure continued alignment of our manufacturing capacity with of customer demand and to finish our planned recording
media and substrate capacity expansions in Asia, while we continue to improve our utilization of capital equipment.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities of approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2008 was primarily attributable to the repurchases of our common
shares totaling $1.5 billion. Additionally, we paid approximately $216 million in dividends to our shareholders, repaid $34 million of our long-term debt and received approximately $178 million in cash from employee stock option exercises
and employee stock purchases.

Net cash used in financing
activities of $463 million for fiscal year 2007 was primarily attributable to approximately $1.5 billion used for the repurchases of our common shares, $416 million used in the redemption of our 8% Notes and $212 million of
dividends paid to our shareholders, largely offset by approximately $1.5 billion received from the issuance of long-term debt and $219 million cash provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases.

Net cash used in financing activities of $732 million for fiscal year
2006 was primarily attributable to $399 million used in the repurchases of common shares, the repayment of a $340 million term loan and $155 million of dividends paid to our shareholders, partially offset by $118 million cash
provided by employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases.



Liquidity Sources and Cash Requirements and Commitments

Our principal sources of liquidity as of June 27, 2008, consisted of:
(1) approximately $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, (2) cash we expect to generate from operations and (3) a $500 million revolving credit facility.

Our $500 million revolving credit facility that matures in September
2011 is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sub-limit of $100 million. Although no borrowings have been drawn under this revolving credit facility to date, we had used $62 million for outstanding
letters of credit and bankers’ guarantees as of June 27, 2008, leaving $438 million for additional borrowings, subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing.

The credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility contains
covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the agreement. This credit agreement contains three financial covenants: (1) minimum cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio;
and (3) a net leverage ratio. As of June 27, 2008, we are in compliance with all covenants.

In October 2006, we used $416 million of the net proceeds from the September 2006 issuance of $1.5 billion debt to redeem the $400 million
principal amount of our 8% Notes and pay a $16 million redemption premium.

Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, research and development, capital expenditure needs, and to service our debt. In addition, since the second half of fiscal year 2002 and
through the June 2008 quarter, we have paid dividends to our shareholders.

On August 17, 2007, November 16, 2007, February 16, 2008 and May 16, 2008, we paid dividends aggregating approximately $216 million, or $0.42 per share, to our common shareholders of
record as of August 3, 2007, November 2, 2007, February 1, 2008 and May 2, 2008. On July 15, 2008, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share that will be paid on or before August 15, 2008 to our common
shareholders of record as of August 1, 2008. In deciding whether or not to declare quarterly dividends, our directors will take into account such factors as general business conditions within the disc drive industry, our financial results, our
capital requirements, contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our shareholders, the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may
deem relevant.

With respect to the closure of our Limavady and
Milpitas facilities, we expect to pay cash restructuring charges aggregating approximately $25 million to $30 million in the next 12 months.

Because we had current earnings and profits in excess of distributions for our taxable year ended June 27, 2008, distributions on our common shares
to U.S. shareholders during this period were treated as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We anticipate that we will have earnings and profits in excess of distributions in fiscal year 2009. Therefore, distributions to
U.S. shareholders in fiscal year 2009 are anticipated to be treated as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Non-U.S. shareholders should consult with a tax advisor to determine appropriate tax treatment.

As a result of the acquisition of Maxtor, we assumed all of Maxtor’s
outstanding debts, including, without limitation, its outstanding convertible senior notes. Maxtor’s 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due August 2012 (the “2.375% Notes), of which $326 million were outstanding as of
June 27, 2008, contain a cash conversion feature that will require Seagate to deliver the holders, upon any conversion of these notes, cash in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the principal amount of the notes converted and
(b) the as-converted value of the notes. We will also be required to deliver an additional amount equal to the difference between the as-converted value of the notes and the principal amount in either cash or stock at our election. To the
extent holders of the Maxtor



notes choose to convert their notes, Seagate may require additional amounts of cash to meet this obligation. The payment of dividends to holders of the
Company’s common shares have in certain quarters resulted in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2.375% Notes and may continue in the future. If the conversion rate continues to increase, we may be required to book an
increased amount of interest expense.

In December 2007, we
completed our acquisition of MetaLINCS, in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $74 million. MetaLINCS provides enterprise level E-Discovery software that helps companies respond to litigation and regulatory issues which requires
them to search large volumes of electronic data for relevant information.

During fiscal year 2008, we repurchased approximately 65 million of our common shares through open market repurchases at an average price of $22.89 for a total of approximately $1.5 billion. We repurchased
approximately $974 million under the $2.5 billion August 2006 stock repurchase plan and approximately $500 million under a new plan announced on February 4, 2008, to repurchase up to an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common shares
over 24 months. As of June 27, 2008 we had no amounts remaining under the August 2006 stock repurchase plan and had approximately $2.0 billion remaining under the February 2008 stock repurchase plan. See Part II, Item 5: “Market
for Registrant’s Common Shares, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Repurchases of Our Equity Securities.” During fiscal year 2007, we repurchased 62 million shares for $1.5 billion.

As part of our strategy, we may selectively pursue strategic alliances,
acquisitions and investments. Any material future acquisitions, alliances or investments will likely require additional capital. We may enter into more of these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional
equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, future capital expenditures,
any increased working capital requirements and share repurchases. If we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of existing cash or cash flow from operations, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing on
terms acceptable to us, if at all.

We believe that our sources
of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to fund these requirements and comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on our future
operations, performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

Our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of June 27, 2008, have been summarized in the table below (in millions):



(1)

Included in long term debt for fiscal year 2009, is the principal amount of $326 million related to our 2.375% Notes which is payable upon the conversion of the
2.375% Notes, which are currently convertible as our share price was in excess of 110% of the conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading days during the last 30 trading days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Unless earlier
converted, the 2.375% Notes must be redeemed in August 2012.

(2)

Includes total future minimum rent expense under non-cancelable leases for both occupied and abandoned facilities (rent expense is shown net of sublease income).

(3)

Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services, which are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specify all significant
terms.

As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we
reclassified unrecognized tax benefits to long-term income taxes payable. As of June 27, 2008, we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits including accrual for the payment of related interest totaling $210 million, none of which is
expected to be paid within one year. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of June 27, 2008, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K).

Critical Accounting Policies

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical
accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and operating results, and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. Based on this definition, our most
critical policies include: establishment of sales program accruals, establishment of warranty accruals, accounting for income taxes, and the valuation of intangibles and goodwill. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates
and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts, valuation of inventory, valuation of share-based payments and acquisition related restructuring. We believe that
these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results
of operations for a given period.

Establishment of Sales
Program Accruals.

We establish certain distributor and OEM sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. For the distribution channel, these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor’s level of
sales, order size, advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments. For OEM sales, rebates are typically based on an OEM customer’s volume of purchases from Seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs. We provide for
these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements. We estimate these contra-revenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors, including price reductions during the period reported, estimated future price
erosion, customer orders, distributor sell-through and inventory levels, program participation, customer claim submittals and sales returns. Our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer
claim rates and attainment of program goals, and inventory and sell-through levels reported by our distribution customers.

While we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and
adjustments, actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations. As a result, actual payments under these programs, which may spread over several months



after the related sale, may vary from the amount accrued. Accordingly, revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected. For
example, if the pricing environment is more competitive than we anticipated, accruals for forward price protection rebates may be inadequate. In addition, during periods in which our distributors’ inventories of our products are at higher than
historical levels, our contra-revenue estimates are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher. Currently, our distributors’ inventories are within the historical range.

Significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which
we base our contra-revenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results. Since fiscal year 2006, total sales programs have ranged from 7% to 9% of gross revenues. Due to the competitive pricing environment in our industry, sales
programs as a percentage of gross revenue may increase from the current range. If such rebates and incentives trend upwards, revenues and margins will be reduced. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to
revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 0.3% of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years 2006 through 2008.

In addition, our failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by our distribution customers could have a material impact on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Establishment of Warranty Accruals.

We estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of three to five years. Our warranty provision
considers estimated product failure rates and trends (including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods), estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues,
if any. We use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates. Should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates, or should the rate of
future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past, our future results of operations could be materially affected. Our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products and
legacy Maxtor designed products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates.

The actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit
failure, the cost to repair a unit, or the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims are greater than that which we have used in estimating the warranty accrual. Since we typically outsource our warranty repairs, our repair cost
is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates. We also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disc drives. To the extent such sales fall below our forecast, warranty cost will be
adversely impacted.

Our warranty cost has ranged from
approximately 2% to 2.5% of revenue over the last three years. We review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in
adjustments that will impact the current period gross margins and income. Re-estimates of prior warranty accruals have approximated 0.5% or less of revenue in fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. Higher than anticipated failures of specific products
(as we had in fiscal years 2004 and 2005) and significant increases in repair or replacement costs driven by reduced sales for refurbished products (as during the fiscal years 2006 and 2007) have historically been the major reasons for
significant re-estimates.

Income
Taxes.

We account for income taxes pursuant to SFAS No. 109 and related pronouncements. In applying, SFAS No. 109, we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement
purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, recognition of income and deductions and in the calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue
and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United
States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Each



period, we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and, if necessary, adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax
assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. If our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly, our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may
also change.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we
adopted FIN 48—see Part II, Item 8, Note 4 for additional discussion. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax
positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax jurisdiction. If our estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or provision will result.

Valuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill.

In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

(SFAS No. 141), the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the
acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be
reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not
limited to: future expected cash flows from existing technology, customer relationships, trade names, and other intangible assets; the acquired company’s brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the
acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual
results.

We are required to periodically evaluate the carrying
values of our intangible assets for impairment. If any of our intangible assets are determined to be impaired, we may have to write down the impaired asset and our earnings would be adversely impacted in the period that occurs.

At June 27, 2008, our goodwill totaled approximately $2.4 billion
and our identifiable other intangible assets totaled $111 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(SFAS No. 142), we assess the impairment of goodwill at least
annually, or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed its fair value. This assessment may require the projection and discounting of cash flows, analysis of our market capitalization
and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Estimates of cash flow are based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance; judgment is also exercised in determining
an appropriate discount rate. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in operating performance. Significant differences
between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2008, FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued Issue No. 07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

(EITF No. 07-5). EITF
No. 07-5 addresses the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock. EITF No. 07-5 would require us to account for our embedded conversion options as derivatives and record
them on our balance sheet as a liability with subsequent fair value changes recorded in the income statement. Although EITF No. 07-5 would have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows, it may require us to record an additional
liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Subsequent fair value adjustments may result in significant charges or credits recorded in our consolidated statement of operations. As a result, our



financial position and results of operations and earnings per share may be impacted. EITF No. 07-5 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application by an entity that has previously adopted an alternative accounting policy is not permitted. During fiscal year 2009, we will be
evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of EITF No. 07-5 on our fiscal year 2010 consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP), Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 14,

Accounting for Convertible Debt
Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement

) (FSP APB No. 14), which, may require us to recognize additional non-cash interest expense related to our Convertible Senior Notes in our
consolidated statements of operations. FSP APB No. 14 requires the issuer to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate. FSP APB No. 14 will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted. FSP APB No. 14 must
be applied retrospectively to all periods presented pursuant to the guidance of SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

(SFAS No. 154). Our accounting for the 2.375% Notes acquired from Maxtor and
therefore our results of operations and financial condition may be impacted by this FSP APB No. 14. During fiscal year 2009, we will be evaluating the impact of FSP APB No. 14 on our fiscal year 2010 consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP
FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(FSP FAS 142-3). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. During fiscal year 2009, we
will be evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 on our fiscal year 2010 consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133

(SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 requires disclosure of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged
items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, with early adoption permitted. We will be evaluating the impact of the
pending adoption of SFAS No. 161 on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(SFAS No. 141(R)). The standard changes the
accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring liabilities, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax
valuation allowance. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We currently believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will result in the recognition of certain
types of expenses on our results of operations that are currently capitalized pursuant to existing accounting standards, amongst other potential impacts. SFAS No. 141(R) will impact the accounting for business combinations completed by us on or
after adoption in our fiscal year 2010.

In February 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning



after November 15, 2007. We do not expect to adopt SFAS No. 159 with respect to our current assets and liabilities but will continue to evaluate
the potential application of SFAS No. 159 on an on-going basis.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value
is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt SFAS No. 157 for financial assets in our fiscal year 2009 and for non-financial assets in our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of SFAS
No. 157 on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.



ITEM 7A.    QUALITATIVE

AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio
and long-term debt. We currently do not use derivative financial instruments in either our investment portfolio or to hedge debt.

As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk
and market risk. We mitigate default risk by maintaining portfolio investments in diversified, high-quality investment grade securities with limited time to maturity. We constantly monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to
respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository. We maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets. At June 27, 2008,
our exposure to sub-prime mortgage securities was not significant. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any downgrades, losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or short-term investments since
June 27, 2008.

We have both fixed and variable rate debt
obligations. We enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs. We currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure.

At June 27, 2008, we had no marketable securities that had been in a
continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months and determined no investments were other-than-temporarily impaired.

Investment Securities

.    As of June 27, 2008, we held auction rate securities in the amount of $31 million, all of which
are collateralized by pools of student loans guaranteed by the Federal Family Education Loan Program. During the fiscal 2008 year, these securities failed to settle at auction and as a result we recorded an unrealized loss of $3 million and
reclassified the securities to long-term investments.



The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of
maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of June 27, 2008. All investments, other than our auction rate securities, mature in three years or less. Included in long term debt for fiscal year 2009, is the principal amount of
$326 million related to our 2.375% Notes which is payable upon the conversion of the 2.375% Notes, which are currently convertible, as our share price was in excess of 110% of the conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading
days during the last 30 trading days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Unless earlier converted, the 2.375% Notes must be redeemed in August 2012.

Fiscal Years Ended

Foreign Currency
Exchange Risk.

We recognize all of our derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward contracts, on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and these derivative financial instruments are
carried at fair value.

We may enter into foreign currency
forward contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments, certain foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. Our policy prohibits us from entering into
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

We transact business in various foreign countries and our primary foreign currency cash flows are in countries where we have
a manufacturing presence. We have established a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the change in value of foreign currency cash flows resulting from operating and capital expenditures over the next year. We hedge portions of our
forecasted expenditures denominated in foreign currencies with foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. When the U.S. dollar weakens significantly against the foreign currencies, the increase in value of the future foreign
currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthens, the decrease in value of the future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in
the value of the foreign currency forward contracts. These foreign currency forward contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities of up to twelve months.



For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, we initially record the effective portion of
the gain or loss on the derivative in Other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion is reported in earnings. Amounts in Other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted
transaction affects earnings.

We also hedge a portion
of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of these hedges are
recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities. These foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

We evaluate
hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in Other income (expense) on the Statement of Operations. We did not have any net gains (losses) recognized in Other income
(expense) for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. Nor did we discontinue any cash flow hedges for a probable forecasted transaction that would not occur in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006.

As of June 27, 2008, our notional fair values of foreign currency
forward contracts totaled $729 million. We do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks, because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of highly rated financial institutions, we manage the notional amount of
contracts entered into with any one counterparty, and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions. The table below provides information as of June 27, 2008, about our derivative
financial instruments, comprised of foreign currency forward contracts. The table is provided in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts (at the contract exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign
currency exchange rates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

—Seagate Technology (“Seagate,” or
“the Company”) designs, manufactures and markets rigid disc drives. Hard disc drives, which are commonly referred to as disc drives or hard drives, are used as the primary medium for storing electronic data in systems ranging from desktop
and notebook computers, and consumer electronics devices to data centers delivering electronic data over corporate networks and the Internet. The Company produces a broad range of disc drive products addressing enterprise applications, where its
products are primarily used in enterprise servers, mainframes and workstations; desktop applications, where its products are used in desktop computers; mobile computing applications, where its products are used in notebook computers; and consumer
electronics applications, where its products are used in a wide variety of devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs), gaming devices and other consumer electronic devices that require storage. The Company sells its disc drives primarily to
major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and retailers. The Company also sells its branded storage solutions under both the Seagate and Maxtor brands.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

—The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. The methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its consolidated financial statements. The SEC
has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. Based on this definition, the Company’s most critical policies include: establishment of sales program accruals, establishment of
warranty accruals, accounting for income taxes, as well as the valuation of intangibles and goodwill. Below, these policies are discussed further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. The Company also has other key accounting policies
and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts, valuation of inventory, valuation of share-based payments (see Note 3) and acquisition related restructuring (see Note 10). The Company believes that these other
accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on the Company’s reported
results of operations for a given period.

The Company
establishes certain distributor and OEM sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand. For the distribution channel, these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor’s level of sales, order size, advertising or point of
sale activity and price protection adjustments. For OEM sales, rebates are typically based on an OEM customer’s volume of purchases from the Company or other agreed upon rebate programs. The Company provides for these obligations at the time
that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements. The Company estimates these contra-revenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors, including price reductions during the period reported, estimated future price erosion, customer
orders, distributor sell-through and inventory levels, program participation, customer claim submittals and sales returns. The Company’s estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also the Company’s judgment relating to variables such
as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals, and inventory and sell-through levels reported by the Company’s distribution customers. During periods in which the Company’s distributors’ inventories of its products are at
higher than historical levels, the Company’s sales programs estimates are subject to a greater degree of subjectivity and the potential for actual results to vary is accordingly higher. Currently, the Company’s distributors’
inventories are within the historical range. Significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which the Company bases its contra-revenue estimates could have a material effect on the Company’s operating results. In addition, the
Company’s failure to accurately predict the level of future sales returns by its distribution customers could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company estimates probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. The Company
generally warrants its products for a period of three to five years. The Company’s warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends (including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods), estimated repair
or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues, if any. The Company uses a statistical model to help with its estimates and the Company exercises considerable judgment in determining the
underlying estimates. Should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from its estimates, or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past, the Company’s future results of
operations could be materially affected. The Company’s judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base its warranty
estimates. The Company continually introduces new products.

The actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure, the cost to repair a unit, or the actual cost required to satisfy
customer compensatory claims are greater than that which the Company has used in estimating the warranty accrual. The Company also exercises judgment in estimating its ability to sell certain repaired disc drives. To the extent such sales fall below
the Company’s forecast, warranty cost will be adversely impacted.

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) Statement (SFAS) No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(SFAS No. 109) and related pronouncements. In applying SFAS No. 109, the
Company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, recognition of income and deductions and in the calculation of
specific tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The Company’s
recording of deferred tax assets each period depends primarily on the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Each period, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation
allowance for its deferred tax assets and, if necessary, adjusts the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent the Company concludes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be
realized. If the Company’s outlook for future taxable income changes significantly, the Company’s assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48) (see Note 4). The calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of the
Company’s uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax jurisdiction. If estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or provision will result.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141,

Business
Combinations

(SFAS No. 141), the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the
residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The Company engages third-party valuation firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make
significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and
information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from existing technology,
customer relationships, trade names, and other intangible assets;



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the acquired company’s brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used
in the combined company’s product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

The Company is required to periodically evaluate the carrying values of its
intangible assets for impairment. If any of the Company’s intangible assets are determined to be impaired, the Company may have to write down the impaired asset and its earnings would be adversely impacted in the period that occurs.

At June 27, 2008, the Company’s goodwill totaled approximately
$2.4 billion and its identifiable other intangible assets totaled $111 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(SFAS No. 142), the Company assesses the
impairment of goodwill at least annually, or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed its fair value. This assessment may require the projection and discounting of cash flows, an
analysis of the Company’s market capitalization and the estimation of the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Estimates of cash flow are based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future
operating performance; judgment is also exercised in determining an appropriate discount rate. The Company’s estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the
business model, or changes in operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the Company’s future financial results.

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

—The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.

The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30. Accordingly,
fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 comprised 52 weeks and ended on June 27, 2008, June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively. All references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements represent fiscal years
unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2009 will be 53 weeks and will end on July 3, 2009.

Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances, and Sales Incentive Programs

—The Company’s revenue recognition policy complies with
Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB No. 104). Revenue from sales of products, including sales to distribution customers, is generally recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the buyer,
which typically occurs upon shipment from the Company or third party warehouse facilities, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, including a fixed or determinable price to the buyer, and when collectability is reasonably assured. For our
direct retail customers, revenue is recognized on a sell-through basis.

Estimated product returns are provided for in accordance with SFAS No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists

. The Company also adheres to the requirements of Emerging Issue Task Force (EITF) No. 01-09

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer

, (EITF No. 01-09) for sales incentive programs. Estimated reductions to revenue for sales incentive programs, such as price protection, and sales growth bonuses, are recorded
when revenue is recorded. Marketing development programs are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense depending on the contractual nature of the program and whether the conditions of EITF No. 01-09 have
been met.

Product Warranty

—The Company warrants
its products for periods ranging from three to five years. A provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty returns is recorded when revenue is recognized and is included in cost of revenue. Shipping and handling costs are also included
in cost of revenue.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Inventory

—Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (which approximates actual cost
using the first-in, first-out method) or market. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated cost of completion and disposal.

Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements

—Land, equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements are stated
at cost. The cost basis of assets acquired in the Maxtor business combination was based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition (see Note 10). Equipment and buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease. The cost of additions and substantial improvements to property,
equipment and leasehold improvements are capitalized. The cost of maintenance repairs to property, equipment and leasehold improvements is expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets

—The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 142. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, and is not subject to amortization. In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, the Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant.

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on
the fair value of assets received. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. The Company’s acquisition-related intangible assets are comprised of
existing technology, customer relationships, trade names, and other intangible assets and are amortized over periods ranging from one to four years on a straight-line basis. SFAS No. 142 further requires that intangible assets be reviewed for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(SFAS No. 144).

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

—The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon expected collectability.
This reserve is established based upon historical trends, current economic conditions and an analysis of specific exposures. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative expense (see Note 2).

Advertising Expense

—The cost of advertising is
expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $55 million, $51 million and $40 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

—Effective July 2, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123
(Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the modified-prospective-transition method. The Company has included stock-based compensation costs in its results of operations for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 (see
Note 3). The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations. The Company has elected to apply the with-and-without method to assess the realization of excess tax benefits.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation

—The
U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Company’s foreign operations. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. The gains and losses from the
remeasurement of foreign currency denominated balances into U.S. dollars are included in net income (loss) for those operations.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Derivative Financial Instruments

—The Company applies the requirements of
SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(SFAS No. 133) and SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
(SFAS No. 149). Both standards require that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships (see Note 2).

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

—The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company’s short-term investments
are primarily comprised of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase. The Company has classified its entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
securities are classified as cash equivalents or short-term investments and are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of shareholders’ equity. The
amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense). The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The Company invests in auction rate securities. As of June 30, 2006 and June 29, 2007, auction rate securities that had stated maturities greater than three months
were classified as short-term investments unless they were purchased three months or less from contractual maturity. As of June 27, 2008, the Company reclassified all auction rate securities to long-term investments due to failed auctions (see
Note 2).

Strategic Investments

—The Company
enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. Strategic investments are included in the accompanying balance sheets in other assets, net, are recorded at cost and are periodically analyzed to
determine whether or not there are indicators of impairment. The carrying value of the Company’s strategic investments at June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007 totaled $34 million and $25 million, respectively.

Concentration of Credit Risk

—The Company’s customer base for
disc drive products is concentrated with a small number of OEMs and distributors. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily accounts receivable, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectability of all
accounts receivable. The Company places its cash equivalents and short-term investments in investment-grade, highly liquid debt instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.

Supplier Concentration

—Certain of the raw materials and
components used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential materials and components due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the
industry. If the Company were unable to procure certain of such materials or components, it would be required to reduce its manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, the Company
has made prepayments to certain suppliers. Should these suppliers be unable to deliver on their obligations or experience financial difficulty, the Company may not be able to recover these prepayments.

Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In
the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company adopted FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

– see Note 4 for additional discussion. The calculation of tax
liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of the Company’s uncertain tax positions



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax jurisdiction. If estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax
benefit or provision will result (see Note 4).

In June 2008,
FASB EITF issued Issue No. 07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

(EITF No. 07-5). EITF No. 07-5 addresses the determination of whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock. EITF No. 07-5 would require the Company to account for its embedded conversion options as derivatives and record them on its balance sheet as a liability with subsequent fair
value changes recorded in the income statement. Although EITF No. 07-5 would have no impact on the Company’s actual past or future cash flows, it may require it to record an additional liability on its consolidated balance
sheet. Subsequent fair value adjustments may result in significant charges or credits recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. As a result, its financial position and results of operations and earnings per share
may be impacted. EITF No. 07-5 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application by an entity that has previously
adopted an alternative accounting policy is not permitted. During fiscal year 2009, the Company will be evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of EITF No. 07-5 on its fiscal year 2010 consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
(FSP), Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 14,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement

) (FSP APB No. 14), which, may require the Company to
recognize additional non-cash interest expense related to its Convertible Senior Notes in its consolidated statements of operations. FSP APB No. 14 requires the issuer to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion
option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. FSP APB No. 14 will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted. FSP APB No. 14 must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented pursuant to the guidance of SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections

(SFAS No. 154). The Company’s accounting for the 2.375% Notes acquired from Maxtor and therefore its results of operations and financial condition may be impacted by this FSP APB No. 14. During fiscal year
2009, the Company will be evaluating the impact of FSP APB No. 14 on its fiscal year 2010 consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(FSP FAS 142-3). FSP FAS 142-3
amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008 and early adoption is prohibited. During fiscal year 2009, the Company will be evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 on its fiscal year 2010 consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

(SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 requires disclosure of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2008, with early adoption permitted. The Company will be evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of SFAS No. 161 on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(SFAS No. 141(R)). The standard changes the accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for
pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring liabilities, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the
recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. The Company currently believes that the adoption
of SFAS No. 141(R) will result in the recognition of certain types of expenses in its results of operations that are currently capitalized pursuant to existing accounting standards, amongst other potential impacts. SFAS No. 141(R) will
impact the accounting for business combinations completed by the Company on or after adoption in its fiscal year 2010.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not
expect to adopt SFAS No. 159 with respect to its current assets and liabilities but will continue to evaluate the potential application of SFAS No. 159 on an on-going basis.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS No. 157) which
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements.
SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 157 for financial assets in its
fiscal year 2009 and for non-financial assets in its fiscal year 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Fair Value
Disclosures

—The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value. The fair values of short-term investments, debentures, notes and loans are estimated based on quoted market prices as of June 27, 2008.

The carrying values and fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments are as follows:

The fair value of the
Company’s 2.375% and 6.8% convertible securities is a function, in part, of the Company’s stock price. Because the Company’s stock price has decreased since June 27, 2008, the fair value of these securities has also decreased.

Investment Securities

—As of June 27, 2008,
the Company held auction rate securities in the amount of $31 million, all of which are collateralized by pools of student loans guaranteed by the Federal Family Education Loan Program. During the fiscal 2008 year, these securities failed to settle
at auction and as a result the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $3 million and reclassified the securities to long-term investments.

Derivative Financial Instruments

—The Company recognizes all of its derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward
contracts, in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and these derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value.

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments, certain foreign currency
denominated balance sheet positions and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. The Company’s policy prohibits it from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. During fiscal years 2008,
2007 and 2006, the Company did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and its primary foreign currency cash
flows are in countries where it has a manufacturing presence. The Company has established a foreign currency hedging program to protect against the change in value of foreign currency cash flows resulting from operating and capital expenditures over
the next year. The Company hedges portions of its forecasted expenditures denominated in foreign currencies with foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. When the U.S. dollar weakens significantly against the foreign
currencies, the increase in value of the future foreign currency expenditure is offset by gains in the value of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthens, the decrease in value of the
future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the value of the foreign currency forward contracts. These foreign currency forward contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities of up to twelve months.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the company
initially records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in Other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion is reported in Other income (expense). Amounts in Other comprehensive income are reclassified into Cost of
revenue in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

The Company also hedges a portion of its foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk that its earnings will be adversely affected by changes in
currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in Other income (expense) in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities. These foreign currency forward contracts are
not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133.

The Company evaluates hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and records any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in Other income (expense) on the Statement of Operations. The Company did not have any net gains
(losses) recognized in Other income (expense) for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. In addition, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for a probable forecasted transaction that would
not occur in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006.

As of
June 27, 2008, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was approximately $25 million in British pounds, $27 million in Euros, $115 million in Singapore dollars, $510 million in Thai baht, $20
million in Chinese yuan, $2 million in Malaysian ringgit, $15 million in Japanese yen, and $15 million in Czech koruna. The fair value of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at June 27, 2008 was a liability of $24
million. The Company does not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks, because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions with high credit quality ratings, it limits the notional amount on
contracts entered into with any one counterparty and maintains limits on maximum terms of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions. In addition, the exposure related to forward contracts is generally limited to the amount
that a counterparty’s obligation exceeds the amount owed by the Company. Net foreign currency transaction losses included in the determination of consolidated net income were $1 million, $3 million and $6 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

The 2016 Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.8% per
year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2016 Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a “make-whole”
premium redemption price. The “make-whole” redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of
principal and interest on the 2016 Notes being redeemed, discounted at the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury rate plus 50 basis points.

$135 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 6.8% Convertible Senior
Notes due April 2010 (the “6.8% Notes”).

As a result of its acquisition of Maxtor on May 19, 2006 (see Note 10), the Company assumed the 6.8% Notes. The 6.8% Notes require semi-annual interest payments payable
on April 30 and October 30. The 6.8% Notes are convertible into common shares of Seagate Technology at a conversion rate of approximately 30.1733 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Commencing May 5, 2008,
the Company may redeem the 6.8% Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of the common shares for 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day
before the date of the mailing of the redemption notice exceeds 130% of the conversion price on such trading day. If, at any time, substantially all of the common shares are exchanged or acquired for consideration that does not consist entirely of
common shares that are listed on a United States national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the NASDAQ National Market or similar system, the holders of the notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any portion
of the notes at their face value plus accrued interest.

$326 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due August 2012 (the “2.375% Notes”).

assumed the 2.375% Notes. The 2.375% Notes require semi-annual interest payments payable on February 15 and August 15. The 2.375% Notes are convertible into common shares of Seagate Technology at a conversion rate of



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

approximately 58.6938 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, at the option of the holders, at any time during a fiscal quarter if, during
the last 30 trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter the common shares trade at a price in excess of 110% of the conversion price for 20 consecutive trading days. Upon conversion, the 2.375% Notes are subject to “net
cash” settlement whereby the Company will deliver cash for the lesser of the principal amount of the notes being converted or the “conversion value” of the notes which is calculated by multiplying the conversion rate then in effect by
the market price of the Company’s common shares at the time of conversion. To the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the 2.375% Notes, the Company will, at its election, pay cash or issue common shares with a
value equal to the value of such excess. If the 2.375% Notes are surrendered for conversion, the Company may direct the conversion agent to surrender those notes to a financial institution selected by the Company for exchange, in lieu of
conversion, into a number of the Company’s common shares equal to the applicable conversion rate, plus cash for any fractional shares, or cash or a combination of cash and the Company’s common shares in lieu thereof. The 2.375% Notes
are classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets because they are currently convertible as the Company’s share price was in excess of 110% of the conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading days during the last
30 trading days of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. The payment of dividends to holders of the Company’s common shares have in certain quarters resulted in upward adjustments to the conversion rate of the 2.375% Notes and may
continue in the future. If the conversion rate continues to increase, the Company may be required to book an increased amount of interest expense.

$55 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 2012 (the “5.75% Debentures”).

As a
result of the Maxtor acquisition (see Note 10), the Company assumed the 5.75% Debentures. The 5.75% Debentures require semi-annual interest payments on March 1 and September 1 and annual sinking fund payments of $5 million
or repurchases of $5 million in principal amount of debentures in lieu of sinking fund payments. The 5.75% Debentures are currently convertible for a cash payment of $167.50 per $1,000 principal amount of debentures.

$60 million LIBOR Based China Manufacturing Facility
Loan.

As a result of the Maxtor acquisition (see Note 10), the Company assumed an outstanding plant construction loan in the amount of $30 million and an outstanding project loan in the amount of $30 million. In fiscal year 2008,
the Company repaid the $30 million project loan. The interest rate on the plant construction loan is LIBOR plus 70 to 80 basis points, with the borrowings repayable in two installment payments of $15 million each, one due in October 2008
and the other due in April 2009. Interest payments on the construction loan are made semi-annually on October 15 and April 15. The loan requires annual financial covenants, including a maximum liability to assets ratio and a minimum
earnings to interest expense ratio, with which the Company is currently in compliance.

In accordance with APBO No. 14,

Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants,

(“APBO 14”), the Company determined the existence of a substantial premium for both
the 2.375% Notes and 6.8% Notes and recorded the notes at par value with the resulting excess over par (the substantial premium) recorded in Additional Paid-In Capital in Shareholders’ Equity. All other debt assumed in the Maxtor
acquisition was recorded at fair market value (see Note 10).

$400 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 8% Senior Notes Previously due May 2009.

In October 2006, the Company redeemed its 8% Senior Notes due May 2009 (the “8% Notes”) at a redemption price of
$1,040 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for a total amount paid of $416 million. The redemption premium of $16 million as well as approximately $3 million of unamortized issuance costs were recorded as interest expense in the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal year 2007.

The Company has guaranteed all Senior Notes on a full and unconditional basis (see Note 14).

Stock Purchase Plan—

The Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”) in December 2002. At that time, a total of 20 million common shares had been authorized for issuance under the ESPP. On October 26, 2006, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the
number of common shares available for issuance by 10 million bringing the total amount of common shares authorized to be issued under the ESPP to 30 million. In no event shall the total number of shares issued under the ESPP exceed
75 million shares. The ESPP consists of a six-month offering period with a maximum issuance of 2.5 million shares per offering period. The ESPP permits eligible employees who have completed twenty days of employment prior to the
commencement of any offering period to purchase common shares through payroll deductions generally at 85% of the fair market value of the common shares. On January 31, 2008, the Company issued approximately 1.9 million common shares under
its ESPP, with a weighted-average purchase price of $17.23. On July 31, 2007, the Company issued approximately 1.6 million common shares under its ESPP, with a weighted-average purchase price of $19.98. As of June 27, 2008, there were
approximately 9 million common shares available for issuance under the ESPP.

Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)

Effective July 2, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the modified-prospective-transition method.

Determining Fair Value

Valuation and amortization method

—The Company estimates the fair
value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model and a single option award approach. This fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the
vesting period or the remaining service (vesting) period.

Expected Term

—Expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the
contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards.

Expected Volatility—

The Company uses a combination of the implied volatility of its traded options and
historical volatility of its share price.

Expected
Dividend

—The Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input. The dividend yield is determined by dividing the expected per share dividend during the coming year by the grant date share price. The
expected dividend assumption is based on the Company’s current expectations about its anticipated dividend policy. Also, because the expected dividend yield should reflect marketplace participants’ expectations, the Company does not
incorporate changes in dividends anticipated by management unless those changes have been communicated to or otherwise are anticipated by marketplace participants.

Risk-Free Interest Rate

—The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation
model on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. Where the expected term of the Company’s stock-based awards do not correspond with the terms for which interest rates are
quoted, the Company performed a straight-line interpolation to determine the rate from the available term maturities.

Estimated Forfeitures

—When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual option
forfeitures.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Fair Value

—The fair value of the Company’s stock options granted to employees,
assumed from Maxtor and issued from the ESPP for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 were estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:

Stock Compensation Expense

Stock Compensation Expense

—The Company recorded
$98 million, $101 million and $74 million of stock-based compensation during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, the Company recorded $15 million, $27 million and $16 million of stock-based compensation
in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with the assumed options and nonvested shares exchanged in the Maxtor acquisition (see Note 10).

As required by SFAS No. 123(R), management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing
compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.

In accordance with guidance in SFAS No. 123(R), the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits (tax benefits related to the excess of proceeds from employee’s exercises of stock options over the stock-based compensation
cost recognized for those options) are classified as financing cash flows. The Company recorded approximately $6 million of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow during fiscal year 2008. The Company did not recognize any cash flows
from excess tax benefits during fiscal year 2007. The Company recorded approximately $44 million of excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow during fiscal year 2006.

Stock Option Activity

The Company issues new common shares upon exercise of stock options. The following is a summary of option activity for the
Company’s stock option plans, including options assumed from Maxtor, for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2008:

The aggregate
intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common shares for the 28.0 million options that were in-the-money at June 27, 2008. During
fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Company’s stock option plans was $155 million, $280 million and $228 million, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. The
aggregate fair value of options vested during fiscal year 2008 was approximately $84 million.

At June 27, 2008 the total compensation cost related to options granted to employees under the Company’s stock option plans (excluding options
assumed in the Maxtor acquisition) but not yet recognized was approximately $122 million, net of estimated forfeitures of approximately $17 million. This cost is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining
term of approximately 2.3 years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures. In addition to the stock-based compensation cost not yet recognized under the Company’s stock option plans, the Company has additional
stock-based compensation costs related to options assumed in the Maxtor acquisition of approximately $2 million, which will be amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.9 years.

Nonvested Share Activity

The following is a summary of nonvested share activity under the
Company’s stock option plans, and nonvested stock assumed from Maxtor for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2008:

amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining term of 2.1 years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures. In addition, the Company has additional stock-based compensation related to nonvested
shares exchanged in the Maxtor acquisition of approximately $7 million, which will be amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years.

At the Company’s 2007 Annual General Meeting on October 25, 2007, the Company’s shareholders approved the issuance of 925,000 performance
shares to senior officers of the Company. Subject to continued employment, these performance shares will vest based upon the achievement of certain earnings per share performance objectives as defined in the performance share agreements. The
requisite service periods for these awards do not commence until fiscal year 2009. As such, no compensation expense was recognized and no shares vested during fiscal year 2008. During fiscal year 2008, 16,000 of these performance shares were
cancelled.

ESPP Information

During fiscal years
2008 and 2007, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Company’s ESPP was $12 million and $25 million, respectively. At June 27, 2008, the total compensation cost related to options to purchase the Company’s
common shares under the ESPP but not yet recognized was approximately $2 million. This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.2 years.

The following table shows the shares issued, and their respective
weighted-average purchase price, pursuant to the ESPP during fiscal year 2008.

Deferred Compensation Plan

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted a deferred
compensation plan for the benefit of eligible employees. This plan is designed to permit certain discretionary employer contributions, in excess of the tax limits applicable to the 401(k) plan and to permit employee deferrals in excess of certain
tax limits. Company assets earmarked to pay benefits under the plan are held by a rabbi trust. The Company has adopted the provisions of EITF No. 97-14,

Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned are Held in a
Rabbi Trust and Invested

(EITF 97-14). Under EITF 97-14, the assets and liabilities of a rabbi trust must be accounted for as assets and liabilities of the Company. In addition all earnings and expenses of the rabbi

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

trust are recorded as other income or expense in the Company’s financial statements. The corresponding gain or loss on deferred compensation plan
liabilities is offset against compensation expenses in cost of revenue and operating expenses. At June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, the deferred compensation amounts related to the rabbi trust included in Other Assets, net on the
accompanying balance sheets were approximately $132 million and $136 million, respectively. At June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, the deferred compensation obligation related to the rabbi trust included in Accrued expenses on the
accompanying balance sheets were approximately $138 million and $139 million, respectively.

4.  Income Taxes

The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following:

Income before income
taxes consisted of the following:

For fiscal year 2008
there were $6 million tax benefits recorded to Additional Paid-In Capital associated with stock option deductions. The Company did not record a tax expense associated with stock option deductions in fiscal year 2007 compared to $44 million recorded
in fiscal year 2006; the related tax benefit was recorded directly to Additional Paid-In Capital.

U.S. federal and state deferred tax expense in fiscal year 2008 was $37 million. In fiscal year 2007, the deferred tax benefit of $359 million includes
$319 million of deferred tax benefits resulting from the release of valuation allowance recorded in prior years. The fiscal year 2007 valuation allowance release was largely due to the completion during 2007 of the restructuring of the
Company’s intercompany arrangements, which enables the Company to forecast future U.S. taxable income with greater certainty and U.S. taxable income from the



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

intercompany sale of certain Maxtor assets. This 2007 valuation allowance release also included a reduction of $322 million in Maxtor goodwill required as a
result of the reversal of valuation allowance previously recorded as of the acquisition date against Maxtor related deferred tax assets primarily for tax net operating loss carryovers.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

As of June 27,
2008, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded was $433 million. Approximately $22 million of this amount relates to deferred tax assets acquired in the Maxtor transaction for which the related benefit will be credited directly to
goodwill when and if realized. The net increase in the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2008 was $34 million. In fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the valuation allowance decreased by $580 million and increased by $327 million, respectively. The fiscal
year 2007 valuation allowance release was largely due to the completion during 2007 of the restructuring of the Company’s intercompany arrangements, which enables the Company to forecast future U.S. taxable income with greater certainty and
U.S. taxable income from the intercompany sale of certain Maxtor assets.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

At June 27, 2008, the Company had recorded $890 million of net deferred tax assets. The
realization of $808 million of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient U.S. and certain foreign taxable income in future periods. Although realization is not assured, the Company’s
management believes that it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease, when the Company reevaluates the underlying basis for its
estimates of future U.S. and certain foreign taxable income.

At June 27, 2008, the Company had U.S. federal, state and foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2 billion, $896 million and $690 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2009 if
not utilized. At June 27, 2008, the Company had U.S. federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $238 million and $87 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2009, if not utilized. These net operating losses and
tax credit carryforwards have not been audited by the relevant tax authorities and could be subject to adjustment on examination. Of the $2 billion of loss carryovers noted above, approximately $859 million will be credited to Additional Paid-in
Capital upon recognition.

As a result of the Maxtor
acquisition, Maxtor underwent a change in ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC Sec. 382) on May 19, 2006. In general, IRC Section 382 places annual limitations on the use of certain tax
attributes such as net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at the ownership change date. As of June 27, 2008, approximately $1.3 billion and $337 million of U.S. federal and state net operating losses, respectively, and $36
million of tax credit carryovers acquired from Maxtor are generally subject to an annual limitation of approximately $110 million. Certain amounts may be accelerated into the first five years following the acquisition pursuant to IRC
Section 382 and published notices.

On January 3,
2005, the Company underwent a change in ownership under IRC Section 382 due to the sale of common shares to the public by its then largest shareholder, New SAC. Based on an independent valuation as of January 3, 2005, the annual limitation
for this change is $44.8 million. As of June 27, 2008, there is $453 million of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and $110 million of U.S. tax credit carryforwards subject to IRC Section 382 limitation associated with the
January 3, 2005 change. To the extent management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets associated with tax attributes subject to IRC Section 382 limitations will not be realized, a valuation allowance has been
provided.

The applicable statutory rate in the Cayman Islands
was zero for the Company for fiscal years ended June 27, 2008, June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006. For purposes of the reconciliation between the provision for (benefit from) income taxes at the statutory rate and the effective tax
rate, a notional U.S. 35% rate is applied as follows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

A substantial portion of the Company’s manufacturing operations in China, Malaysia, Singapore,
Switzerland and Thailand operate under various tax holidays and tax incentive programs, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2020. Certain of the tax holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net impact of
these tax holidays and tax incentive programs was to increase the Company’s net income by approximately $214 million in fiscal year 2008 ($0.40 per share, diluted), $194 million in fiscal year 2007 ($0.33 per share, diluted), and $197 million
in fiscal year 2006 ($0.38 per share, diluted).

The Company
consists of a foreign parent holding company with various foreign and U.S. subsidiaries. Dividend distributions received from the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes when, and if, distributed. Deferred tax
liabilities have not been recorded on unremitted earnings of certain other foreign subsidiaries, as these earnings will not be subject to tax in the Cayman Islands or U.S. federal income tax if remitted to the foreign parent holding company.

Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year
2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The first
step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or
litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company increased its liability for net unrecognized tax benefits at the
date of adoption. The Company accounted for the increase primarily as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $3 million and an increase to goodwill of $25 million. The total amount
of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was $385 million excluding interest and penalties. At June 27, 2008, the Company had approximately $374 million in total unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties.
The total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $63 million and $75 million as of June 29, 2007 and June 27, 2008, respectively.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized
tax benefits from June 30, 2007 to June 27, 2008:

The Company’s
policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations did not change as a result of implementing the



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

provisions of FIN 48. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, the Company had accrued approximately $19 million for the payment of interest and penalties
relating to unrecognized tax benefits. This accrual increased by $3 million to approximately $22 million as of June 27, 2008.

During the 12 months ending June 27, 2008, the Company recognized a previously unrecognized tax benefit of approximately $13 million related to the
recognition of foreign uncertain tax benefits as a result of new information obtained during the year. The Company also recognized a previously unrecognized tax benefit of approximately $9 million for foreign uncertain tax benefits resulting in a
reduction of the Maxtor goodwill as a result of the expiration of certain foreign statutes of limitation for pre-acquisition periods.

During the 12 months beginning June 28, 2008, the Company expects to reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $21 million as a result of the
expiration of certain statutes of limitation. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the resolution and/or timing of closure on open audits
are highly uncertain as to when these events occur.

The
Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. The statutes of limitation for U.S. Federal returns are open for fiscal year 2003 and forward. The Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of fiscal years ending in 2003
and 2004. For state and foreign tax returns, the Company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year 2001.

5. Restructuring Costs and Other

Ongoing Restructuring Activities

During fiscal year 2008, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $88 million, comprised mainly of charges related to the planned closures
of its Limavady, Northern Ireland and Milpitas, California operations. These restructuring and other charges are reported in Restructuring and other in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The restructuring charges associated with the Limavady facility were
primarily related to employee termination costs of $29 million and approximately $18 million related to expected grant repayments. The Company plans to cease production of its Limavady facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and
expects all activities related to this closure to be complete by the second half of fiscal year 2009. The Company expects additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million to be recorded primarily over the next two quarters, resulting in
aggregate restructuring charges of approximately $60 million to $65 million.

The Company recorded approximately $19 million of restructuring charges associated with employee termination costs related to the planned closure of its media manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. The
Company plans to cease production of its Milpitas facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and expects all activities related to this closure to be complete by the second half of fiscal year 2009. The Company expects additional
restructuring charges of approximately $17 million to be recorded primarily over the next two quarters, resulting in an aggregate restructuring charge of approximately $36 million. In addition, as a result of the planned closure of the Milpitas
facility, the Company expects approximately $38 million relating to accelerated asset depreciation to be recorded to cost of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.

The remaining restructuring and other charges were primarily comprised of employee termination costs as a result of plans to
continue the alignment of the Company’s global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements around the world. The Company expects these restructuring activities to be completed by the end of its fourth quarter of fiscal year
2009.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

During fiscal year 2007, the Company recorded restructuring costs of approximately $33 million
in connection with its ongoing restructuring activities. These costs were primarily a result of a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of the Company’s global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements,
primarily in its U.S. and Far East operations and asset impairments. The restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs of approximately $14 million relating to a reduction in the Company’s workforce, approximately
$11 million in charges related to impaired facility improvements and equipment as a result of the alignment plan, and approximately $8 million in charges related to impaired other intangibles. These restructuring and impairment charges are
reported in Restructuring and other in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, the Company reversed $4 million of restructuring accruals relating to the sale of a surplus building impaired in a prior restructuring. The Company
has substantially completed these restructuring activities.

During fiscal year 2006, the Company recorded restructuring costs of approximately $4 million in connection with its ongoing restructuring activities. These restructuring costs are reported in Restructuring and other in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. These costs were related to a restructuring plan established to continue the alignment of the Company’s global workforce with existing and anticipated business requirements in its Far East operations. The
restructuring costs were comprised of employee termination costs relating to a continuing effort to optimize our production around the world. The Company has completed these restructuring activities.

The following table summarizes the Company’s restructuring activities
for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Common shares

—Holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends when and as
declared by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”). Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after required payments are made to holders of preferred shares, any remaining assets of the
Company will be distributed ratably to holders of the preferred and common shares. Holders of shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which the common shares are entitled to vote, including the election of directors.

Preferred shares

—The Company is authorized to
issue up to a total of 100,000,000 preferred shares in one or more series, without shareholder approval. The Board of Directors is authorized to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the rights,
preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. The Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of
shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the shareholders.

The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of
the holders of the common shares. The issuance of preferred shares, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change in control of the Company and might harm the market price of its common shares and the voting and other rights of the holders of common shares. As of June 27, 2008, there were no preferred shares outstanding.

Issuance of Common Shares

During fiscal year 2008, the Company issued approximately 10 million of
its common shares from the exercise of stock options, 0.9 million related to the issuance of performance shares, approximately 0.2 million of nonvested shares and approximately 3.6 million of its common shares related to the Company’s
employee stock purchase plan.

Repurchases of Equity Securities

On August 8, 2006, the Company announced that its
board of directors authorized the use of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of the Company’s outstanding common shares over a two-year period. The Company also announced a new plan on February 4, 2008, to repurchase up to an
additional $2.5 billion of the Company’s outstanding common shares over a two-year period. During fiscal year 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 65 million of its common shares, all of which were cancelled and are no longer
outstanding, through open market purchases at an average price of $22.89 for a total of approximately $1.5 billion. Of this amount, the Company repurchased approximately $974 million under the $2.5 billion August 2006 stock repurchase plan and
approximately $505 million under the $2.5 billion February 2008 stock repurchase plan. As of June 27, 2008, the Company had no amounts remaining under the August 2006 stock repurchase plan and had approximately $2.0 billion remaining under
the February 2008 stock repurchase plan.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As of June 27, 2008, the Company had no amounts remaining under the August 2006 stock repurchase
plan and had approximately $2.0 billion remaining under the February 2008 stock repurchase plan. Share purchases during the fiscal year were as follows:

From the authorization
of the August 2006 stock repurchase plan and through the fiscal year ended June 29, 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 62.0 million shares, all of which were cancelled and are no longer outstanding. The Company repurchased these
shares through a combination of open market purchases and prepaid forward agreements with large financial institutions, according to which the Company prepaid the financial institutions a fixed amount to deliver a variable number of shares at future
dates. The Company entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of its common shares. The Company’s policy has been to enter
into such transactions only when the discount that it receives is higher than the foregone return on its cash prepayment to the financial institution. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these prepaid forward agreements. Under the terms of
these agreements, there was no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to the Company. These prepaid forward agreements were not derivatives because the Company had prepaid all amounts and had no remaining
obligation. The agreements do not contain an embedded derivative. The prepayments were recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity when paid and the shares were deducted from shares outstanding. The agreements require the physical delivery
of shares; there were no settlement alternatives, except in the case of certain defined extraordinary events which are outside the control of Seagate and the financial institutions. The parameters used to calculate the final number of shares
deliverable were the total notional amount of the contract and the average VWAP of the Company’s stock during the contract period less the agreed upon discount. The contracts are indexed solely to the price of Seagate’s common shares.

During fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased
24.3 million shares through open market repurchases. In addition, the Company made payments totaling $950 million under prepaid forward agreements and took delivery of 37.7 million shares using prepaid forward agreements. Shares
physically delivered to the Company were cancelled and were no longer outstanding. At June 29, 2007, there were no outstanding prepaid forward

agreements to repurchase the Company’s common shares. As of June 29, 2007, the Company had approximately $974 million remaining under the
authorized $2.5 billion August 2006 stock repurchase program.

8.  Commitments

Leases

—The Company leases certain property, facilities and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements. Land and facility leases expire at various dates through 2082 and contain various provisions for rental adjustments
including, in certain cases, a provision based on increases in the Consumer Price Index. Also, certain leases provide for renewal of the lease at the Company’s option at expiration of the lease. All of the leases require the Company to pay
property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs.

Future
minimum lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more were as follows at June 27, 2008 (lease payments are shown net of sublease income):

Total rent expense for
all land, facility and equipment operating leases was approximately $32 million, $36 million and $24 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total sublease rental income for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6
million, $11 million and $6 million, respectively. The Company subleases a portion of its facilities that it considers to be in excess of current requirements. As of June 27, 2008, total future lease income to be recognized for the
Company’s existing subleases is approximately $26 million.

The Company established reserves for both adverse and favorable leasehold interests and for exit costs that apply directly to the lease commitments assumed through the acquisition of Maxtor. As of June 27, 2008, in accordance with
SFAS No. 141, the Company has recorded a $52 million adverse leasehold interest and a $4 million favorable leasehold interest. Both the adverse and favorable leasehold interest reserves are being amortized to Cost of Revenue and
Operating Expenses over the remaining duration of the leases. In addition, the Company had $17 million and $28 million remaining in accrued exit costs related to the planned exit of Maxtor leased excess facilities at June 27, 2008 and
June 29, 2007, respectively.

Capital
Expenditures

—The Company’s commitments for construction of manufacturing facilities and equipment approximated $289 million at June 27, 2008.

adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, the Company may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect adverse effect on its results of operations. Accordingly, actual
results could differ materially.

Intellectual Property
Litigation

Convolve, Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) v. Seagate Technology LLC, et al.

Between 1998 and 1999, Convolve, Inc., a small privately held technology
consulting firm founded by an MIT Ph.D., engaged in discussions with Seagate Technology, Inc. with respect to the potential license of technology that Convolve claimed to own. During that period, the parties entered into non-disclosure agreements.
We declined Convolve’s offer of a license in late 1999. On July 13, 2000, Convolve and MIT filed suit against Compaq Computer Corporation and us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging patent
infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and fraud relating to Convolve and MIT’s Input Shaping

and Convolve’s
Quick and Quiet™ technology. The plaintiffs claim their technology is incorporated in the Company’s sound barrier technology, which was publicly announced on June 6, 2000. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, $800 million in
compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages. We answered the complaint on August 2, 2000 and filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment that two Convolve/MIT patents are invalid and not infringed and that the Company owns any
intellectual property based on the information that the Company disclosed to Convolve. The court denied plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery and ordered plaintiffs to identify their trade secrets to defendants before discovery could
begin. Convolve served a trade secrets disclosure on August 4, 2000, and the Company filed a motion challenging the disclosure statement. On May 3, 2001, the court appointed a special master to review the trade secret issues. The special
master resigned on June 5, 2001, and the court appointed another special master on July 26, 2001. After a hearing on the Company’s motion challenging the trade secrets disclosure on September 21, 2001, the special master issued a
report and recommendation to the court that the trade secret list was insufficient. Convolve revised the trade secret list, and the court entered an order on January 1, 2002, accepting the special master’s recommendation that this trade
secret list was adequate. On November 6, 2001, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued US Patent No. 6,314,473 to Convolve. Convolve filed an amended complaint on January 16, 2002, alleging defendants’
infringement of this patent, and the Company answered and filed counterclaims on February 8, 2002. On July 26, 2002, the Company filed a Rule 11 motion challenging the adequacy of plaintiffs’ pre-filing investigation on the first
two patents alleged in the complaint and seeking dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims related to these patents and reimbursement of attorney’s fees. The court denied the Company’s motion on May 23, 2003. On May 6, 2003, the USPTO
issued to Convolve U.S. Patent No. 6,560,658 B2, entitled “Data Storage Device with Quick and Quiet Modes.” Convolve indicated that it would seek leave of the court to add this patent to the lawsuit, but it never did so. This
latest patent is a continuation of a patent currently in the lawsuit (U.S. Patent No. 6,314,473). We believe any claims that may relate to this continuation patent would be without merit, regardless of whether such claims were added to the
ongoing litigation or asserted against us in a separate lawsuit. Judge John Martin, who was assigned this case, announced his retirement from the federal bench. The case was reassigned to Judge George B. Daniels. On October 14, 2003, the
Special Master resigned from the case due to Convolve’s claim that he had a conflict of interest. Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV was appointed to handle all discovery matters. Plaintiffs have indicated that they will dismiss claims
regarding U.S. Patent No. 5,638,267 from the case. The claims construction hearing on U.S. Patent Nos. 4,916,635 and 6,314,473 was held on March 30 and 31, 2004. On August 11, 2005, the court entered an order construing the
patent claims. Both Seagate and Compaq moved for reconsideration of its claim construction in light of intervening new law in the Federal Circuit’s then-recent decision in

Phillips v. AWH Corp., et al.

, 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir.
2005). Convolve also moved for clarification. The court denied reconsideration without oral argument on December 7, 2005. The court later granted Convolve’s unopposed clarification motion. On March 29, 2006, the court granted
Seagate’s summary judgment



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

motion that Convolve’s fraud, tortious interference with contract, unfair competition, and breach of confidence claims are preempted by the California
Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA). The court also held that while Convolve’s claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not preempted by the CUTSA, no tort damages are available. The court denied the Company’s
motion for summary judgment on a trade secret issue, finding there is an issue of fact that must be decided. Finally, the court entered an order on July 14, 2006, that Convolve has no evidence to prove its claims regarding 10 alleged trade
secrets, precluding Convolve from proceeding at trial on those claims, and precluding Convolve from alleging violations of the 10 alleged trade secrets by either defendant prior to December 7, 2005, the date of the hearing. At Seagate’s
request, the USPTO determined that both patents in suit have substantial new issues of patentability and ordered reexamination of the patents. The court denied the Company’s motion to stay the case pending patent reexamination. In initial
office actions, the USPTO Examiner rejected all claims of both patents as unpatentable. No trial date has been set. We believe the claims are without merit, and the Company intends to defend against them vigorously.

Shao Tong, et al. v. Seagate International (Wuxi) Co.,
Ltd.

In July 2002, the Company were sued in the People’s Court of Nanjing City, China, by an individual, Shao Tong, and a private Chinese company, Nanjing Yisike Network Safety Technique Co., Ltd. The complaint
alleged that two of the Company’s personal storage disc drive products infringe Chinese patent number ZL94111461.9, which prevents the corruption of systems data stored on disc drives. The suit, which sought to stop us from manufacturing the
two products and claimed immaterial monetary damages, was dismissed by the court on procedural grounds on November 29, 2002. On December 3, 2002, the plaintiffs served us with notice that they had refiled the lawsuit. The new complaint
contains identical infringement claims against the same disc drive products, claims immaterial monetary damages and attorney’s fees and requests injunctive relief and a recall of the products from the Chinese market. Manufacture of the accused
products ceased in May 2003. At a hearing on March 10, 2003, the court referred the matter to an independent technical advisory board for a report on the application of the patent claims to the two products. On June 10, 2003, the Company
presented its non-infringement case to the technical panel. The panel issued a technical advisory report to the court finding no infringement. The court heard oral arguments on the technical advisory report in September 2003, issued an order that
the Company’s products do not infringe the patent and rejected plaintiffs’ lawsuit. Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Jiangsu High Court, and the Company filed its opposition brief on January 21, 2004. The PRC Patent Reexamination
Board declared patent ZL94111461.9 invalid on March 28, 2004. The Jiangsu High Court stayed the appeal on the infringement case pending a final judgment on patent invalidity. On June 22, 2004, Shao Tong filed a lawsuit in the Beijing
Intermediate People’s Court against the PRC PRB challenging its patent invalidity decision. On November 29, 2004, the court affirmed the decision of patent invalidity. In December 2004, Shao Tong appealed the decision to the Beijing High
People’s Court, the highest appellate court, and a hearing was held June 22, 2005. The court scheduled a rehearing on December 8, 2005, and subsequently reversed the lower court and PRB decisions due to a procedural error. The case
was remanded to the PRB for further action to correct the procedural error. A new PRB panel was appointed and the procedural error was corrected. The invalidity case was reargued at a hearing on May 9, 2006. In 2006, the Company filed a second
invalidity proceeding with the PRB. On June 14, 2007, the PRB issued an order holding the patent invalid based on the first invalidity request. The second invalidity request was stayed as a result of the ruling on the first request. Shao Tong
again filed a lawsuit against the PRC PRB and the court affirmed the invalidity decision in December 2007. In January 2008, Shao Tong appealed this decision to the Beijing High People’s Court. In a final judgment issued in June 2008, the court
upheld the patent invalidity decision of the PRC PRB. The Jiangsu High Court dismissed Shao Tong’s appeal of the judgment of noninfringment, bringing this matter to a close.

Siemens, AG v. Seagate Technology.

On August 23, 2006, Siemens, AG, a German corporation,
filed a complaint against Seagate Technology in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,686,838 (the ‘838 patent) entitled “Magnetoresistive Sensor Having at
Least a Layer System and a Plurality of Measuring Contacts Disposed Thereon, and a Method of Producing the Sensor.”



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The suit alleges that Seagate drives incorporating Giant Magnetic Resistance (GMR) sensors infringe the ‘838 patent. The complaint seeks damages in an
unstated amount, an accounting, preliminary and permanent injunctions, prejudgment interest, enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement, and attorney fees and costs. The lawsuit was served on Seagate on September 6, 2006. We served an
answer to the complaint on November 27, 2006, denying all material allegations and asserting affirmative defenses. Siemens amended its complaint to add Tunnel Magnetic Resistance (TMR) sensors to the case. On May 9, 2008, the court entered
summary judgment that TMR sensors are not covered by the ‘838 patent, thus eliminating TMR products from the case. Trial is scheduled to begin November 11, 2008. We believe the claims are without merit, and the Company intends to defend
against them vigorously.

StorMedia Texas LLC v. Comp
USA, et al.

On January 22, 2007, a lawsuit was filed against 11 defendants, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,805,891 (the ‘891 patent), a media patent that is allegedly owned by StorMedia
Texas LLC. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division. All major hard disc drive companies are named, including Seagate Technology, Seagate Technology LLC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Samsung, Toshiba,
and Western Digital, as well as retailers Comp USA, J&R Electronics, and Tiger Direct. We served an answer to the complaint on April 13, 2007, denying all material allegations and asserting affirmative defenses. A request for reexamination
of the ‘891 patent was granted and all claims were rejected as unpatentable over the prior art in an initial office action dated March 17, 2008. The court denied a motion to stay the case pending patent reexamination. On June 1, 2008,
the Company also filed a request for reexamination of the ‘891 patent on different grounds. Trial is scheduled to begin on March 4, 2009. We believe the claims are without merit, and the Company intends to defend against them vigorously.

Environmental Matters

Our operations inside and outside the United States are subject to laws and
regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and clean-up of contaminated sites.
Contaminants have been detected at some of the Company’s current and former sites, principally in connection with historical operations. In addition, the Company has been named as a potentially responsible party at several superfund sites.
Investigative activities have taken place at all sites of known contamination. One former site is under a Consent Order by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The extent of the contamination at this site has been investigated and defined
and remediation is underway. We are indemnified by a third party for a portion of the costs that may be incurred in the clean up of contamination at most sites. In the opinion of management, the probability is remote that the losses arising from
these environmental matters would be material to the Company’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

We may be subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including those restricting the presence of
certain substances in electronic products. For example, the European Union (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), which prohibits the use of
certain substances, including lead, in certain products, including hard drives, put on the market after July 1, 2006 as well as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) directive, which makes producers of electrical
goods, including disc drives, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United
States, Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. We will need to ensure that the Company complies with such laws and regulations as they are enacted, and that its component suppliers also timely comply with such laws and regulations. If the Company fails to
timely comply with the legislation, its customers may refuse to purchase its products, which would have a materially adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Other Matters

The Company is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to its business, and it may
be involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business in the future. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

10.  Acquisitions

Maxtor Corporation

On December 20, 2005, the Company entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Maxtor Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and MD Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Seagate, by which Seagate agreed to acquire
Maxtor (the “Merger”), and whereby Maxtor would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Seagate. On May 19, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of Maxtor in a stock-for-stock transaction. The acquisition was structured to qualify
as a tax-free reorganization and the Company has accounted for the acquisition in accordance with SFAS No. 141. The purpose of the acquisition was to enhance the Company’s scale and capacity to better drive technology advances and
accelerate delivery of a wide range of differentiated products and cost-effective solutions to a growing base of customers.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Maxtor common stock was exchanged for 0.37 of the Company’s common shares. The Company issued
approximately 96.9 million common shares to Maxtor’s shareholders, assumed and converted Maxtor options (based on the 0.37 exchange ratio) into options to purchase approximately 7.1 million of the Company’s common shares and
assumed and converted all outstanding Maxtor nonvested stock into approximately 1.3 million of the Company’s nonvested shares. The purchase consideration comprising the fair value of the common shares, stock options and nonvested shares
assumed and including transaction costs was approximately $2.0 billion, excluding assumption by the Company of Maxtor’s approximate $576 million of outstanding debt obligations.

Purchase Price Allocation

The application of purchase accounting under SFAS No. 141 requires
that the total purchase price be allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date, with amounts exceeding the fair values being recorded as goodwill. The allocation process
requires an analysis and valuation of acquired assets, including fixed assets, technologies, customer contracts and relationships, trade names and liabilities assumed, including contractual commitments and legal contingencies.

The Company identified and recorded the assets, including specifically
identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Maxtor at their estimated fair values as at May 19, 2006, the date of acquisition, and allocated the residual value of approximately $2.2 billion to goodwill, including
$297 million of net adjustments recorded during fiscal year ended June 29, 2007. These net adjustments which reduced goodwill were primarily due to the reversal of part of the valuation allowance previously recorded as of the acquisition
date against certain deferred tax assets comprised of former Maxtor operating losses (see Note 4 and Note 11).

Determination of Fair Values

The Company assigned fair values to all the assets and liabilities assumed as of May 19, 2006. For certain tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, the Company utilized the assistance of a third party valuation firm in accordance with SFAS No. 141.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements

In general, plant and equipment that was to continue to be used was valued
at current replacement cost for similar capacity while plant and equipment to be sold or held and not used, was valued at fair value less cost to sell. Land and buildings were valued using the replacement cost approach if they were to continue to be
used or the market approach if they were to be sold. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the property, plant and equipment and leasehold improvements acquired from Maxtor and their estimated useful lives:

Inventories

The Company allocated $347 million of the purchase price
to inventories acquired. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories were valued based on the Income Method, which is based on the projected cash flows derived from selling the finished goods inventory, adjusted for costs of disposition and the
profit commensurate with the amount of investment and degree of risk, and in the case of the work-in-process, also the expected costs of completion. Raw materials were valued based on the Replacement Cost Method. The recorded fair values of the
inventories have been charged to Cost of Revenue as the inventories were sold.

Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the Company identified intangible assets apart from goodwill if one of the following criteria was met: 1) the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights; or
2) the asset is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired enterprise and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in conjunction with a related contract, asset, or liability. The recorded values
and estimated useful lives of the intangibles acquired from Maxtor were:

Existing technology
relates to Maxtor’s products across all of their product lines that have reached technological feasibility as well as a combination of Maxtor’s processes, patents, and trade secrets developed through years of experience in design and
development of their products. Existing technology was valued using the Excess Earnings Method under the Income Approach. This approach reflects the present value of projected cash flows that a market participant would expect to generate from these
technologies less charges related to the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The fair value of the existing technology was amortized to Cost of Revenue in fiscal year 2007 as the Company phased out the use of these technologies and
transitioned to Seagate-designed products.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The fair value of customer relationships was determined using the Excess Earnings Method under the
Income Approach based on the estimated revenues to be derived from Maxtor’s OEM, distribution and retail customers. This approach reflects the present value of projected cash flows that a market participant would expect to generate from these
customer relationships less charges related to the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The fair values of the customer relationships are being amortized to Operating Expenses on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of three
to four years.

Trade names reflect the value associated with
Maxtor’s brand names. Trade names were valued using the Relief-from-Royalty Method, a form of the Income Approach, which estimates the royalty cost avoided by owning the trade names as opposed to having to license them from an independent third
party. The resulting cash flow savings estimated over the remaining useful life of the trade names are then discounted to present value to arrive at the fair value allocated to this intangible. Trade names are being amortized to Operating Expenses
over the estimated useful life of four years.

In-Process
Research and Development

As of the date of the
acquisition, all future development activities at Maxtor were discontinued. Therefore there were no assets that qualified as in-process research and development.

Debt Assumed

Upon the closing of the Merger, the Company assumed all of Maxtor’s outstanding debt, including Maxtor’s convertible senior notes. In addition,
upon the closing of the Merger, Seagate and Maxtor entered into a supplemental indenture whereby Seagate agreed to unconditionally guarantee the notes on a senior unsecured basis (see Note 14).

In accordance with APBO 14, the Company determined the existence of a
substantial premium for both the 2.375% Notes and 6.8% Notes and recorded the notes at par value with the resulting excess over par (the substantial premium) recorded in Additional Paid-In Capital included in Shareholders’ Equity. All
other debt was recorded at fair market value.

Adverse/Favorable
Leasehold Interests

In accordance with the guidance in
SFAS No. 141, the Company analyzed all contractual leases to determine the fair value of the leasehold interests. An adverse leasehold position exists when the present value of the contractual rental obligation is greater than the present
value of the market rental obligation. Conversely, a favorable leasehold interest exists if the present value of the contractual rental obligation is less than the present value of the market rental obligation. The Company recorded adverse leasehold
interests totaling $74 million and favorable leasehold interest aggregating $4 million, which have been and will be amortized to Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses over the remaining duration of the leases.

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with Maxtor Acquisition

Under EITF 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Business
Combination,

the Company accrued certain exit costs aggregating $246 million, of which $108 million relates to employee severance, $45 million relates to the planned exit of leased or owned excess facilities and $93 million
relates to the cancellation or settlement of contractual obligations that will not provide any future economic benefit. The severance and associated benefits liability related to the employment termination of approximately 4,900 Maxtor employees,
primarily in the U.S. and Far East, all of whom had been terminated as of June 29, 2007. In the fiscal year ended June 27, 2008, the Company paid $16 million of the accrued exit costs. The Company’s payments for severance
and related benefits and for contractual settlements were substantially completed as of June 29, 2007, while the payments associated with the exit of certain facilities will continue to the end of fiscal year 2016.

The following table summarizes the Company’s exit activities in
connection with the Maxtor acquisition:

Accrued exit costs are
included in short-term and long-term Accrued Restructuring on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Stock-Based Compensation

The fair value of stock-based compensation related to the unearned stock options and nonvested shares assumed from Maxtor was approximately $69 million, net of forfeitures, of which approximately $58 million has been amortized
through June 27, 2008. The remaining $11 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service (vesting) periods of the underlying stock options or nonvested shares.

Pro Forma Financial Information

The unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes the
combined results of operations of the Company and the results of Maxtor prior to the Merger, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of July 3, 2004 for the period presented. Pro forma financial information for our
other acquisitions have not been presented, as the effects were not material to our historical consolidated financial statements either individually or in aggregate. The pro forma financial information for the period presented also includes the
business combination accounting effect on conforming Maxtor’s revenue recognition policy to the Company’s, adjustments related to the fair value of acquired inventory and fixed assets, amortization charges from acquired intangible assets,

EVault, Inc.

In order to expand its current product and service offerings, in January
2007, the Company completed its acquisition of EVault in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $186 million, which included approximately $2 million in estimated acquisition-related expenses. EVault provides data storage services
for small to medium size businesses, including online backup, data protection and recovery solutions.

The purchase price had been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair
values on the acquisition date as follows (in millions):

Tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed

$


Identifiable intangible assets


In-process research and development


Goodwill

Tangible net assets
were valued at their respective carrying amounts as the Company believes that these amounts approximated their current fair values at the acquisition dates. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired reflects management’s
estimates based on, among other factors, use of established valuation methods. Such assets consist of existing technology, customer relationships and trade names. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated remaining useful
lives. The Company assigned $4 million to the value of EVault’s in-process research and development projects as at the acquisition date, all of which was written off in the period of acquisition. Goodwill of approximately $122 million
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The EVault acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

MetaLINCS, Inc.

In December 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of MetaLINCS, Inc.
(“MetaLINCS”) in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $74 million. MetaLINCS provides enterprise level E-Discovery software that helps companies respond to litigation and regulatory issues which requires them to search large
volumes of electronic data for relevant information. The purpose of the acquisition was to expand on the Company’s software and services offerings. The purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and

11.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the Company allocated the excess of the cost of the acquired entities over the net amounts of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed to goodwill. As at June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, the Company’s goodwill totaled approximately $2.35 billion and $2.30 billion, respectively, of which approximately $2.2 billion relates to the Maxtor acquisition. During
fiscal year 2008, goodwill increased by approximately $52 million, primarily due to goodwill acquired in the MetaLINCS acquisition (see Note 10) and the net effect of the adoption of and current year activity due to FIN 48 (see Note 4). During
fiscal year 2007, goodwill decreased by approximately $175 million, due primarily to a $297 million decrease for adjustments, primarily tax, related to the Maxtor acquisition and an increase of $122 million for goodwill acquired in the EVault
acquisition (see Note 10).

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology,
customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations. Acquired intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization of the existing technology intangible is
charged to Cost of revenue while the amortization of the other intangible assets is included in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, amortization expense for other intangible assets
was $94 million, $152 million and $29 million, respectively. Aggregate annual amortization of other intangible assets, based on their current estimated lives, is estimated to be $62 million, $38 million, $9 million and $2 million for fiscal years
2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

The net carrying
value of intangible assets at June 27, 2008 was $111 million and accumulated amortization of intangibles was $273 million. In fiscal year 2008, the Company recorded a write-off of in-process research and development related to the acquisition of
MetaLINCS in the amount of $4 million, which is included in Product development in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The carrying value of intangible assets at June 27, 2008 is set forth in the table below.

the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The carrying value of intangible assets at June 29, 2007 is set forth in the table below.

12.   Guarantees

Indemnifications to Officers and Directors

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements, a form of which is
incorporated by reference in the exhibits of this report, with the members of our board of directors to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred
by the directors as a result of any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding in which the directors are sued as a result of their service as members of our board of directors.

Intellectual Property Indemnification Obligations

The Company has entered into agreements with customers and suppliers that
include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry. These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party
intellectual property claims arising from these transactions. The nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to
its customers and suppliers. Historically, the Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these
indemnification obligations.



SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Product Warranty

The Company estimates probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its products for a period of three
to five years. The Company uses estimated repair or replacement costs and uses statistical modeling to estimate product return rates in order to determine its warranty obligation. In addition, estimated settlements for customer compensatory claims
relating product quality issues, if any, are accrued as warranty expense. Changes in the Company’s product warranty liability during the fiscal years ended June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007 were as follows:

Technology-parent company guarantor, HDD-subsidiary issuer, and the Combined Non-Guarantors based upon the classification of those subsidiaries. Under each of these instruments, dividends paid by HDD or its restricted subsidiaries would constitute
restricted payments and loans between the Company and HDD or its restricted subsidiaries would constitute affiliate transactions.

On July 3, 2006, through a corporate organizational change and realignment, Maxtor became a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of HDD and of Seagate
Technology. As a result, beginning July 3, 2006, the investment in Maxtor is accounted for on an equity method basis in the financial information of HDD.

On May 19, 2006, in connection with the acquisition of Maxtor, the Company, Maxtor and the
trustee under the indenture for the 2.375% Notes and 6.8% Notes entered into a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such notes became convertible into the Company’s common shares. In addition, the Company agreed to fully and
unconditionally guarantee the 2.375% Notes and 6.8% Notes on a senior unsecured basis. The Company’s obligations under its guarantee rank in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The
indenture does not contain any financial covenants and does not restrict Maxtor from paying dividends, incurring additional indebtedness or issuing or repurchasing its other securities. The following tables present parent guarantor, subsidiary
issuer and combined non-guarantors Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheets of the Company and its subsidiaries at June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Operations and Cash Flows for the fiscal years

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Seagate Technology

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Seagate Technology as of June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 27, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Seagate Technology at June 27, 2008, and June 29, 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 27, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, under the heading Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, effective June 30, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Seagate
Technology’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated August 12, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Seagate Technology

We have audited Seagate Technology’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Seagate Technology’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Seagate Technology maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2008,
based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Seagate Technology as of June 27, 2008 and June 29, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 27, 2008, and our report dated August 12, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded, based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of June 27, 2008.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, our management has concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of June 27, 2008. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2008 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure controls
and procedures and our internal controls have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Seagate have been detected. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 27, 2008. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
