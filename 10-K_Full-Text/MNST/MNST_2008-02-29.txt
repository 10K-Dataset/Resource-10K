PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Hansen Natural Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on April 25,
            1990. Our principal place of business is at 550 Monica Circle, Suite 201, Corona,
            California 92880 and our telephone number is (951) 739-6200. When this report uses the
            words “Hansen”, “HBC”, “the Company”,
            “we”, “us”, and “our”, these words refer to Hansen
            Natural Corporation and our subsidiaries other than Monster LDA Company
            (“MLDA”), unless the context otherwise requires.

We are a holding company and carry on no operating business except
            through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Hansen Beverage Company (“HBC”)
            which was incorporated in Delaware on June 8, 1992, MLDA, formerly known as Hard e
            Beverage Company, and previously known as Hard Energy Company and as CVI Ventures,
            Inc., which was incorporated in Delaware on April 30, 1990 and Monster Energy UK
            Limited (“Monster UK”), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of HBC, which was
            incorporated in the United Kingdom on October 9, 2007.

HBC
            generates all of our operating revenues.

We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative”
            beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and
            energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and “functional drinks,”
            non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks,
            Junior Juice® juices and flavored sparkling beverages under the Hansen’s®
            brand name. We also develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the
            following brand names: Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy™, Joker Mad
            Energy™, Unbound Energy® and Ace™ brand names as well as Rumba™
            brand energy juice. We also market, sell and distribute the Java Monster™ line of
            non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, natural sodas, premium natural sodas with
            supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks
            under the Blue Sky® brand name. Our fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under
            the Junior Juice® brand name. We also market, sell and distribute vitamin and
            mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the Fizzit™ brand name.

We have two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery
            (“DSD”), whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse
            (“Warehouse”), whose principal products comprise juice based and soda
            beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an
            exclusive distributor network whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells
            products primarily directly to retailers.

Corporate History

In the 1930’s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons started a business
            to sell fresh non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles, California. This business
            eventually became Hansen’s Juices, Inc., which subsequently became known as The
            Fresh Juice Company of California, Inc. (“FJC”). FJC retained the right to
            market and sell fresh non-pasteurized juices under the Hansen trademark. In 1977, Tim
            Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a demand for pasteurized
            natural juices and juice blends that are shelf stable and formed Hansen Foods, Inc.
            (“HFI”). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include
            Hansen’s Natural Sodas®. California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a/ Hansen
            Beverage Company) (“CCC”) acquired certain assets of HFI, including the
            right to market the Hansen’s® brand name, in January 1990. On July 27, 1992,
            HBC acquired the Hansen’s® brand natural soda and apple juice business from
            CCC. Under our ownership, the Hansen beverage business has significantly expanded and
            includes a wide range of beverages within the growing “alternative”
            beverage category, including in particular, energy drinks. In September 1999, we
            acquired all of FJC’s rights to manufacture, sell and distribute fresh
            non-pasteurized juice products under the Hansen’s® trademark together with
            certain additional rights. In 2000, HBC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Blue Sky
            Natural Beverage Co. (“Blue Sky”), which was incorporated in Delaware on
            September 8, 2000, acquired the natural soda business previously conducted by Blue Sky
            Natural Beverage Co., a New Mexico


corporation (“BSNBC”), under the Blue Sky® trademark. In
            2001, HBC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Hansen Junior Juice Company,
            (“Junior Juice”), which was incorporated in Delaware on May 7, 2001,
            acquired the Junior Juice business previously conducted by Pasco Juices, Inc.
            (“Pasco”) under the Junior Juice® trademark.

Industry Overview

The alternative beverage category combines non-carbonated ready-to-drink
            iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single serve juices and fruit beverages,
            ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks, and single-serve
            still water (flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with “new age” beverages,
            including sodas that are considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling
            beverages. The alternative beverage category is the fastest growing segment of the
            beverage marketplace according to Beverage Marketing Corporation. According to Beverage
            Marketing Corporation, wholesale sales in 2007 for the alternative beverage category of
            the market are estimated at $25.5 billion representing a growth rate of approximately
            11.4% over the estimated wholesale sales in 2006 of approximately $22.9
            billion.

Reportable Segments

We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products
            comprise energy drinks and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and
            soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through
            an exclusive distributor network whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and
            sells products primarily direct to retailers. Corporate and unallocated amounts that do
            not relate to the DSD or Warehouse segments specifically have been allocated to
            “Corporate & Unallocated.”

For financial information about our reporting segments and geographic
            areas, refer to Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in
            Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this
            report, incorporated herein by reference. For certain risks with respect to our energy
            drinks see “Part I, Item 1A – “Risk Factors” below."

Products

Natural Sodas.

Hansen’s Natural
            Sodas® have been a leading natural soda brand in Southern California for the past
            25 years. In 2007, according to Information Resources, Inc.'s Analyzer Reports for
            California, our natural sodas recorded the highest sales among comparable carbonated
            new age category beverages measured by unit volume in the California market. Our
            natural sodas are available in eleven regular flavors consisting of mandarin lime, key
            lime, grapefruit, raspberry, ginger ale, creamy root beer, vanilla cola, cherry vanilla
            creme, orange mango, kiwi strawberry and pomegranate. In early 2001, we introduced a
            new line of diet sodas using Splenda® sweetener as the primary sweetener. We
            initially introduced this line in four flavors: peach, black cherry, tangerine lime,
            and kiwi strawberry, and have since added four additional flavors: ginger ale, creamy
            root beer, grapefruit and pomegranate. Our natural sodas contain no preservatives,
            sodium, caffeine or artificial coloring and are made with high quality natural flavors
            and citric acid. We are currently in the process of converting the sweeteners used in
            our natural sodas from high fructose corn syrup to cane sugar. Our diet sodas are
            sweetened with Splenda® and Acesulfame-K. We package our natural sodas in 12-ounce
            aluminum cans. In 2002, we introduced a line of natural mixers in 8-ounce aluminum cans
            comprising club soda, tonic water and ginger
            ale

.

In January 1999, we introduced a premium line of Signature Sodas in
            unique proprietary 14-ounce glass bottles. This line was marketed under the
            Hansen’s® brand name, primarily through our distributor network, in six
            flavors. In early 2003, we repositioned this line into lower cost 12-ounce glass
            packaging to market our repositioned Signature Soda line at lower price points directly
            to our retail customers such as grocery chains, club stores, specialty retail chains
            and mass merchandisers and to the health food sector through specialty and health food
            distributors (collectively referred to as our “direct


retail customers”). Signature Soda was available in 12-ounce glass
            bottles in four flavors: orange crème, vanilla crème, ginger beer and
            sarsaparilla. We are in the process of discontinuing this product.

In September 2000, we acquired the Blue Sky® natural soda business
            from BSNBC. Our Blue Sky® product line comprises natural sodas, premium sodas,
            organic natural sodas, seltzer water, energy drinks, tea sodas and isotonic sports
            drinks. Blue Sky® natural sodas are available in twelve regular flavors consisting
            of lemon lime, grapefruit, cola, root beer, raspberry, cherry vanilla creme, Jamaican
            ginger ale, black cherry, orange creme, Dr. Becker, grape and cream soda. We also offer
            a premium line of Blue Sky® natural sodas which contain supplements such as
            ginseng. This line is available in four flavors consisting of ginseng cola, ginseng
            root beer, ginseng ginger ale and ginseng pomegranate. During 1999, Blue Sky®
            introduced a line of organic natural sodas, which are available in six flavors
            consisting of lemon lime, new century cola, orange divine, ginger ale, black cherry
            cherish, and root beer. We also market a seltzer water under the Blue Sky® label in
            three flavors: natural, lime and lemon. In 2002, we introduced a lightly carbonated
            Blue Sky® energy drink in an 8.3-ounce slim can. In 2006, we introduced a 16-ounce
            size of Blue Energy as well as both an 8.3-ounce and 16-ounce size of Blue Sky Juiced
            Energy, which is lightly carbonated and contains 50% juice. In 2004, we introduced a
            new line of Blue Sky® natural tea sodas in four flavors consisting of Imperial Lime
            Green Tea, Peach Mist Green Tea, Pomegranate White Tea and Raspberry Red Tea. We have
            since discontinued the Raspberry Red Tea flavor. The Blue Sky® products contain no
            preservatives, sodium or caffeine (other than the energy drink) or artificial coloring
            and are made with high quality natural flavors. Blue Sky® natural sodas, seltzer
            waters and tea sodas are all packaged in 12-ounce aluminum cans and are marketed
            primarily to direct retail customers. In March 2005, we introduced a new light line of
            Blue Sky® sodas using natural sweeteners in four flavors: cherry vanilla
            crème, creamy root beer, Jamaican ginger ale and wild raspberry in 12-ounce
            cans. We have since discontinued the wild raspberry flavor. In the third quarter of
            2005, we introduced a new line of Blue Sky® natural sodas with real sugar in
            12-ounce cans in four flavors: cherry vanilla crème, cola, ginger ale and root
            beer. In December 2005, we introduced a new line of Blue Sky® isotonic sports
            drinks in 16-ounce polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) plastic bottles in
            three flavors: orange, lemon lime, fruit punch and have subsequently added a fourth
            flavor, blue sky pomegranate. We are currently in the process of converting the
            sweeteners used in those Blue Sky® products that contain high fructose corn syrup
            to cane sugar.

In 2006, we introduced a new line of Hansen’s green tea sodas
            under the Hansen® brand name in 16-ounce aluminum cans that contain no
            preservatives, sodium, caffeine or artificial colors, in four flavors; ginger, lemon
            mint, tangerine and pomegranate. We also introduced a diet version that contains no
            carbohydrates or sugar in three flavors: tangerine, lemon mint, ginger and in 2007,
            introduced an additional diet flavor, pomegranate.

In 2007, we introduced a new line of Hansen’s natural flavored
            sparkling beverages under the Hansen® brand name in contemporary 10.5-ounce sleek
            cans in four flavors: blueberry pomegranate, cranberry grapefruit, valencia orange and
            dragonfruit. We also introduced a sparkling green tea line in contemporary 10.5-ounce
            sleek cans in two flavors: tangerine and pomegranate. These sparkling beverages are
            available in 90 calorie per can versions, sweetened with cane sugar; as well as in
            sugar free versions, sweetened with Splenda® and Acesulfame-K.

Hansen’s® Energy Drinks.

In 1997,
            we introduced a lightly carbonated citrus flavored Hansen's® energy drink in
            8.3-ounce cans in 4 packs. Our energy drink competes in the “functional”
            beverage category, namely, beverages that provide a real or perceived benefit in
            addition to simply delivering refreshment. We also offered additional functional energy
            drinks as well as other functional drinks including a ginger flavored d-stress®
            drink, an orange flavored b-well™ drink, a guarana berry flavored stamina®
            drink, a grape flavored power drink, and a berry flavored “slim-down” drink
            that contained no calories, in the same size cans. We have since discontinued sales of
            such additional functional products. Our energy drinks contain vitamins, minerals,
            nutrients, herbs and supplements (collectively “supplements”). In 2004, we
            offered our Hansen’s® energy drink in 16-ounce cans which has subsequently
            been discontinued. From 2006, we marketed our Hansen’s brand energy drinks
            through the Warehouse segment and introduced Hansen’s® Energy Pro™
            8.3-ounce cans in four packs. In 2001,


we
            introduced Energade®, a non-carbonated energy sports drink in 23.5-ounce cans. We
            are currently reevaluating the Energade® line. In 2001, we also introduced
            E


O Energy Water®, a non-carbonated lightly flavored water, in 24-ounce
            blue PET plastic bottles which has subsequently been discontinued. At the end of 2002,
            we introduced a lightly carbonated diet energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans under the
            Hansen’s Diet Red Energy® brand name. Our Diet Red Energy® energy drink
            is sweetened with Splenda® and Acesulfame-K.

Drinks.

In 2002, we launched a new carbonated energy drink under the Monster
            Energy® brand name, in 16-ounce cans, which was almost double the size of our
            regular energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans and of the vast majority of competitive energy
            drinks on the market at that time. Our Monster Energy® drink contains different
            types and levels of supplements than our Hansen’s® energy drinks and is
            marketed through our full service distributor network. In 2003, we introduced a low

            sized cans of this drink in October 2007. Monster M-80™ energy drinks are lightly
            carbonated and contain 80% juice. In November 2007, we introduced a new Monster Heavy

            2004, we launched a new non-carbonated energy juice under the Rumba™ brand name
            in 15.5-ounce cans. Rumba™ energy juice is a 100% juice product that targets male
            and female morning beverage consumers and is positioned as a substitute for coffee,
            caffeinated sodas and 100% orange or other juices.

Joker Mad Energy

™

Drinks.

In the first quarter of 2005, we
            introduced Joker Mad Energy™ energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. Joker Mad
            Energy™ energy drinks come in regular, lo-carb and juice versions in 16-ounce
            cans.

Ace™ Energy

Drinks.

In August 2006, we introduced Ace™ energy drinks in 16-ounce cans.
            Ace™ energy drinks come in regular, lo-carb and juice versions in 16-ounce
            cans.

Unbound Energy®

Drinks.

In October 2006, we acquired the Unbound Energy®

trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of Unbound
            Energy

®

energy drinks in
            16-ounce cans. We subsequently introduced lo-carb and juice versions in 16-ounce
            cans.


Java Monster™ Coffee Drinks

. In May
            2007, we launched a new line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks under the Java
            Monster™ brand name in 15-ounce cans. We initially introduced this line in three
            flavors: Big Black™ (since renamed Originale), Loca Moca™ and Mean
            Bean™, and have since added five additional flavors: Russian™, Irish
            Blend™, Chai Hai™, Nut Up™ and Lo-Ball™.

Juice Products and Smoothies

. Our fruit
            juice product line includes Hansen's® Natural Apple Juice, which is packaged in
            64-ounce PET plastic bottles and 128-ounce polypropylene bottles and White Grape, White
            Grape Peach, Purple Grape, Orange, Pomegranate, Apple Strawberry and Apple Grape juice
            blends, in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles. These Hansen's® juice products contain
            100% juice (except Pomegranate which contains 27% juice) as well as Vitamin C.
            Hansen's® juice products compete in the shelf-stable juice category. We also offer
            juice cocktails (cranberry raspberry, apple white grape, apple berry and apple) in
            32-ounce PET plastic bottles.

In March 1995, we introduced a line of fruit juice smoothie drinks in
            11.5-ounce aluminum cans. Certain flavors were subsequently offered in glass and PET
            plastic bottles. We have since discontinued offering smoothies in glass and PET plastic
            bottle packages. Hansen’s fruit juice smoothies have a smooth texture that is
            thick but lighter than a nectar. In 2006, we reformulated Hansen’s smoothies by
            adding more fruit purees. Hansen’s smoothies in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans now
            contain approximately 25% juice. Our fruit juice smoothies provide 100% of the
            recommended daily intake for adults of Vitamins A, C & E and represented Hansen's
            entry into what is commonly referred to as the “functional” beverage
            category. Hansen's® fruit juice smoothies are available in seven flavors:
            strawberry banana, peach berry, mango pineapple, guava strawberry, pineapple coconut,
            whipped orange and Island Energy Blast. We have discontinued our lo-carb smoothie
            line.

We market the above juice and smoothie products to our direct retail
            customers.

Iced Teas.

In 2006, we introduced a new
            line of iced teas in sleek 16-ounce wide mouth PET plastic bottles. This line is
            sweetened with cane sugar and includes green tea, peach green tea, lychee black tea and
            pomegranate green tea. In addition, we offer sugar free peach green tea, pomegranate
            green tea and acai black tea which are all sweetened with sucralose as well as an
            unsweetened black tea.

Juices for Children.

In 1999, we introduced
            two new lines of children's multi-vitamin juice drinks in 8.45-ounce aseptic boxes,
            which were subsequently transitioned to 6.75-ounce versions. Each drink contains eleven
            essential vitamins and six essential minerals. We introduce new flavors in place of
            existing flavors from time to time. One of these two lines is a dual-branded 100% juice
            line named Juice Blast® which was launched in conjunction with Costco Wholesale
            Corporation (“Costco”) and is sold through Costco stores. The other line
            was a 10% juice line named “Hansen’s Natural Multi-Vitamin Juice
            Slam®”, which was available to all of our customers. During 2000, we
            repositioned that latter line as a 100% juice line under the Juice Slam® name,
            which we market to grocery store chain customers, the health food trade, and other
            customers. Both the Juice Blast® and Juice Slam® lines are marketed in
            6.75-ounce aseptic boxes. The Juice Slam® line has four flavors and the Juice
            Blast® line has three flavors.

In 2003, we further extended our fruit juice product line by introducing
            a 100% apple juice in 6.75-ounce aseptic pouches under the Apple Blasters™ brand.
            In 2006 we discontinued our Apple Blasters™ product and repositioned our pouch
            line by introducing two

Juice Slam®

organic pouches in organic apple and organic fruit punch flavors with
            100% juice.

In May 2001, we acquired the Junior Juice® beverage business. The
            Junior Juice® product line is comprised of seven flavors of 100% juice in
            4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. Six flavors of the Junior
            Juice® line have calcium added and all flavors have vitamin C added. The current
            flavors in the Junior Juice® line are apple, apple berry, orange twist, apple
            grape, mixed fruit, fruit punch and white grape.


In 2006, we extended the Junior Juice® line by adding organic apple
            and organic berry medley juice products in 4.23-ounce aseptic boxes. Each of our
            organic Junior Juice® products have 100% juice and contain 100% of the daily
            recommended allowance of vitamin C and 10% of the daily recommended allowance of
            calcium.

Bottled Water.

Our still water products
            were introduced in 1993 and are primarily sold in 0.5-liter plastic bottles to the food
            service trade. Sales of this product line are very limited.

Fizzit™

Powdered Drink
            Mixes.

In December 2005, we introduced a new line of vitamin
            and mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the Fizzit™ brand name in both
            functional and vitamin and mineral formulas. The functional formulas are offered in
            raspberry (joint formula), orange (immune support formula), strawberry (immune support
            formula) and cranberry (women’s health formula). The vitamin and mineral formula
            is offered in lemon lime and strawberry flavors.

During 2007, we continued to expand our existing product lines and
            further develop our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and
            marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the
            “alternative” beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type
            drinks.

Other Products

We continue to evaluate and, where considered appropriate, introduce
            additional flavors and other types of beverages to complement our existing product
            lines. We will also evaluate, and may, where considered appropriate, introduce
            functional foods/snack foods that utilize similar channels of distribution and/or are
            complementary to our existing products and/or to which our brand names are able to add
            value.

We also develop and supply, on a limited basis, selected beverages in
            different formats to a limited number of customers with the objective of solidifying
            our relationship with those customers.

Manufacture and Distribution

We do not directly manufacture our products but instead outsource the
            manufacturing process to third party bottlers and contract packers.

We purchase concentrates, juices, flavors, supplements, cans, bottles,
            aseptic boxes, aseptic pouches, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for
            our beverage products which are delivered to our various third party bottlers and
            co-packers. Depending on the product, the third party bottlers or packers add filtered
            water and/or sucrose, or cane sugar, or high fructose corn syrup or Splenda® brand
            sweetener, Acesulfame-K and/or citric acid or other ingredients and supplements for the
            manufacture and packaging of the finished products into Hansen approved containers in
            accordance with our formulas. In the case of sodas and other carbonated beverages, the
            bottler/packer adds carbonation to the products as part of the production
            process.

We are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase of and
            delivery to our third party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our
            beverage products are packaged.

All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party
            bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States under separate
            arrangements with each of such parties. The majority of our co-packaging arrangements
            are on a month-to-month basis. However, certain of our co-packing arrangements are
            described below:

(l) Our agreement with Giumarra & Associates Beverage Company
            (“Giumarra”) pursuant to which Giumarra packages certain of our energy
            drinks and in due course, juices. This contract continues


until June 28, 2009 and is automatically renewable annually thereafter,
            unless either party provides notice of cancellation at least 180 days prior to the end
            of the current term.

In certain instances, equipment is purchased by us and installed at the
            facilities of our co-packers to enable them to produce certain of our products. In
            general, such equipment remains our property and is to be returned to us upon
            termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers or is amortized over a
            pre-determined number of cases that are to be produced at the facilities
            concerned.

We pack certain products outside of the West Coast region to enable us
            to produce products closer to the markets where they are sold and thereby reduce
            freight costs. As volumes in markets outside of California grow, we continue to secure
            additional packing arrangements closer to such markets to further reduce freight
            costs.

Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise,
            particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth,
            particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or
            are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited
            to, glass, PET/plastic bottles, aseptic boxes, cans, labels, flavors or supplement
            ingredients or certain sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to
            satisfy demand on a short-term basis.

Although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or
            are terminable upon request, we believe a short disruption or delay would not
            significantly affect our revenues since alternative packing facilities in the United
            States with adequate capacity can usually be obtained for many of our products at
            commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. However,
            there are limited packing facilities in the United States with adequate capacity and/or
            suitable equipment for many of our products, including Hansen’s® brand energy
            drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, aseptic juice products, teas in 16-ounce PET/plastic bottles,
            Monster Energy®, Lost®
            Energy

™

, Rumba

TM

,
            Joker Mad Energy

TM

, Ace™, Unbound Energy®

energy drinks in 8.3-ounce, 16-ounce, 24-ounce and 32-ounce cans and the
            Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks in 15-ounce cans.
            A disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect
            our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the United
            States with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at
            commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all.
            Consequently, a disruption in production of such products could affect our revenues. We
            continue to seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities in the United
            States or Canada with adequate capacity for the production of our various products to
            minimize the risk of any disruption in production.

On April 28, 2006, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with
            Cadbury Bebidas, S.A. de C.V. (“Cadbury Bebidas”), for exclusive
            distribution by Cadbury Bebidas throughout Mexico, excluding Baja California, of our
            Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

energy products.

On May 8, 2006, HBC entered into the Monster Beverages Off-Premise
            Distribution Coordination Agreement and the Allied Products Distribution Coordination
            Agreement (jointly, the “Off-Premise Agreements”) with Anheuser-Busch,
            Inc., a Missouri corporation (“AB”). Under the Off-Premise Agreements,
            select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the “AB Distributors”) distribute and
            sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s Monster Energy® and Lost®
            Energy

TM

brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, Rumba™ brand energy juice
            and Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks, as well as additional products that may be
            agreed between the parties. We intend to continue building our national distributor
            network primarily with select AB distributors as well as with our sales force
            throughout 2008 to support and grow the sales of our products.

Pursuant to the Anheuser-Busch Distribution Agreements (the “AB
            Distribution Agreements”) entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors,
            non-refundable amounts received totaling $21.0 million and $20.9 million were recorded
            by us related to such appointed AB Distributors for the costs of terminating our prior
            distributors for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
            Such


amounts have been accounted for as deferred revenue in the accompanying
            consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are
            recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the respective AB
            Distribution Agreements. Revenue recognized was $1.9 million and $0.4 million for the
            years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Related distributor receivables
            of $5.4 million and $4.5 million are included in accounts receivable net, in the
            accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
            respectively.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, amounts totaling $0.1 million and $3.3
            million, respectively, were received by us from certain other AB Distributors in
            anticipation of executing AB Distribution Agreements with us. Such receipts have been
            accounted for as customer deposit liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
            sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

We incurred termination costs amounting to $15.3 million and $12.7
            million in aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to
            certain of our prior distributors. Such termination costs have been expensed in full
            and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
            Accrued distributor terminations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of
            December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $4.3 million and $7.0 million, respectively.

On February 8, 2007, HBC entered into the On-Premise Distribution
            Coordination Agreement (the “On-Premise Agreement”) with AB. Under the
            On-Premise Agreement, AB will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution and
            merchandising of Monster Energy® energy drinks to on-premise retailers including
            bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by HBC.

On March 1, 2007, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with
            Pepsi-QTG Canada, a division of PepsiCo Canada, ULC (“Pepsi Canada”), for
            the exclusive distribution by Pepsi Canada throughout Canada of our Monster
            Energy®, Lost® Energy

TM

and Hansen’s® energy
            products.

Distribution levels vary from state to state and from product to
            product. Certain of our products are sold in Canada and Mexico. We also sell a limited
            range of our products to distributors outside of the United States, including in the
            Caribbean, Central and South America, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, South
            Africa and the United Kingdom.

We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering
            into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors
            having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. Many of our
            bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other
            soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many cases, such
            products compete directly with our products.

We continue to endeavor to reduce our inventory levels.

During 2007, we continued to expand distribution of our natural sodas
            outside of California. We expanded our national sales force to support and grow sales,
            primarily of Monster Energy® drinks, Lost® Energy

TM

, Joker Mad
            Energy

TM

, Unbound Energy®, Ace

TM

energy drinks, and
            Rumba

TM

energy juice and we intend to continue to build such sales force in
            2008.

Our Blue Sky® products are sold primarily to the health food trade,
            natural food chains and mainstream grocery store chains, through specialty health food
            distributors.

During 2004, we entered into exclusive contracts with the State of
            California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children
            (“WIC”) Supplemental Nutrition Branch (“DHS”), (the “WIC
            Contracts”) to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce PET
            plastic bottles. The WIC Contracts commenced on July 12, 2004 and were due to expire in
            July 2007. The parties mutually agreed to extend the WIC Contracts until July 11, 2008.
            WIC-approved items are stocked by the grocery trade and by WIC-only stores. Products
            are purchased by WIC consumers with vouchers


given by the DHS to qualified participants. Due to significant cost
            increases mainly for apple juice concentrate and PET plastic bottles, we are currently
            negotiating a mutually acceptable early termination of the WIC Contracts with the State
            of California. We have been informed that future WIC contracts will not be granted on
            an exclusive basis and that certain manufacturers (including HBC) will be eligible to
            sell certain qualifying products to WIC participants. The Company is informed and
            believes that the WIC program intends reducing the total quantity of fruit juice
            products that will be available to WIC participants. We anticipate that as a
            consequence of the above, our revenue from these products is likely to be lower in the
            future. However, we do not believe that such reduction in revenue will have a material
            impact on our future operations.

In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased
            offices in Corona, California. In October 2006, we also entered into a lease agreement
            pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space
            located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental
            payments for 120 months commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly
            rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the
            lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and
            distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space located in
            Corona, California.

In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of
            vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. The property is located adjacent to
            the new leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of
            constructing a new office building on such land, which will replace our existing office
            space.

We have sublet in excess of 50% of our previous office, warehouse and
            distribution space for the remainder of that lease term, which expires in October 2010.
            (See “Part I, Item 2 – Properties”).

Raw Materials and Suppliers

The principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, glass bottles
            and PET plastic bottles as well as juices, sucrose, cane sugar, sucralose, milk and
            cream, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. Due to the consolidations that
            have taken place in the glass industry over the past few years, the prices of glass
            bottles continue to increase. The prices of PET plastic bottles and certain aluminum
            cans increased significantly in 2006 and again in 2007. The prices of glucose, high
            fructose corn syrup, milk, cream, and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple,
            increased significantly in 2007. These increased costs, together with increased costs
            primarily of energy, gas and freight, resulted in increases in certain product costs
            which are ongoing and are expected to continue to exert pressure on our gross margins
            in 2008. We are uncertain whether the prices of these or any other raw materials or
            ingredients will continue to rise in the future.

Generally, raw materials utilized by us in our business are readily
            available from numerous sources. However, certain raw materials are manufactured by
            only one company. Sucralose, which is used alone or in combination with Acesulfame-K in
            our low-calorie products, is purchased by us from a single manufacturer. Certain of our
            cans are only manufactured by a single company in the United States.

With regard to our Java Monster

TM

coffee drinks, the dairy
            industry is subject to shortages and higher demand from time to time which may result
            in higher prices.

With regard to fruit juice and juice-drink products, the industry is
            subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher prices and/or
            lower consumer demand for juices.

We purchase beverage flavors, concentrates, juices, supplements, cane
            sugar, sucrose, sucralose and other sweeteners as well as other ingredients from
            independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.


Generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their
            flavors. Consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our
            flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to
            obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. We
            have identified alternative suppliers of many of the supplements contained in many of
            our beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain fruits and fruit juices, and
            supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be
            experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our
            products.

We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain
            of our flavors and concentrates from other suppliers as well as to conclude
            arrangements with suppliers which would enable us to obtain access to certain
            concentrates or flavor formulas in certain circumstances. We have been partially
            successful in these endeavors. Additionally, in a limited number of cases, contractual
            restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses may limit
            our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers and manufacturers
            and/or distributors.

In connection with the development of new products and flavors,
            independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense of product development,
            thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. We have
            historically developed and successfully introduced new products and flavors and
            packaging for our products and intend to continue developing and introducing additional
            new beverages and flavors.

Competition

The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of
            competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and
            marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a
            relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater
            financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.

Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include
            taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective
            development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging,
            branded product advertising and pricing. We also compete for distributors who will
            concentrate on selling our products ahead of those of our competitors, provide stable
            and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets.
            Competitive pressures in the alternative, energy, coffee and functional beverage
            categories could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share or we
            could experience price erosion, which could have a material adverse affect on our
            business and results.

We have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the
            energy drink category. A number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and
            juice cocktails in larger volume packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass bottles,
            including Sobe, Snapple Elements, Arizona and Fuse, have added supplements to their
            products with a view to marketing their products as “functional” or
            “energy” beverages or as having functional benefits. We believe that many
            of those products contain lower levels of supplements and principally deliver
            refreshment. In addition, many competitive products are positioned differently than our
            energy or functional drinks. Our smoothies and tea lines are positioned more closely
            against those products.

We compete not only for consumer acceptance, but also for maximum
            marketing efforts by multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors, many of
            which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and brands. Our products
            compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially
            better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and
            internationally known producers such as The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc., Cadbury
            Schweppes plc, Red Bull Gmbh, Kraft Foods, Inc., Nestle Beverage Company, Tree Top and
            Ocean Spray. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in
            operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by
            grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.


Our natural sodas compete directly with traditional soda products
            including those marketed by The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc. and Cadbury Schweppes
            plc, as well as with carbonated beverages marketed by smaller or primarily local
            companies such as Jones Soda Co., Clearly Canadian Beverage Company, Crystal Geyser,
            J.M. Smucker Company and with private label brands such as those carried by grocery
            store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.

Our fruit juice smoothies compete directly with Kern’s, Jumex,
            Jugos del Valle and Libby’s nectars, V8 Smoothies, as well as with single serve
            juice products produced by many competitors. Such competitive products are packaged in
            glass and PET bottles ranging from 8- to 48-ounces in size and in 11.5-ounce aluminum
            cans. The juice content of such competitive products ranges from 1% to 100%.

Our apple and other juice products compete directly with Tree Top,
            Mott’s, Martinelli’s, Welch’s, Ocean Spray, Tropicana, Minute Maid,
            Langers, Apple and Eve, Seneca, Northland and also with other brands of apple juice and
            juice blends, especially store brands.

Our energy drinks, including Hansen’s® energy, Diet Red,
            Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy™, Joker Mad Energy™, Ace™
            Energy, Unbound Energy® and Rumba™ energy juice in 8.3-, 16-, 24- and
            32-ounce cans, compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full Throttle, No Fear, Amp,
            Adrenaline Rush, 180, Extreme Energy Shot, Red Devil, Rip It, NOS, Boo Koo,
            Vitaminenergy, and many other brands. The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc. also
            market and/or distribute additional products in that market segment such as Pepsi Max,
            Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew MDX and Vault.

Our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks
            compete directly with Starbucks Frappuccino and other coffee drinks, Rockstar Roasted,
            Caribou Coffee, Cinnabon coffee drinks and Godiva dairy based drinks.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing strategy is to focus our efforts on developing
            brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events in respect of
            all our beverages and drink mixes. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional
            vehicles at events at which we distribute our products to consumers for sampling. We
            utilize “push-pull” methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space
            exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products including
            advertising, in store promotions and in store placement of point of sale materials and
            racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected
            public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes
            such as cancer research and SPCA’s as well as of extreme sports teams such as the
            Pro Circuit – Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross
            and Supercross teams, Robby Gordon Racing Team, Kawasaki Factory International Moto GP
            Team, Kenny Bernstein Drag Racing Team, extreme sports figures and athletes, sporting
            events such as the Monster Energy® Supercross Series, Monster Energy® Pipeline
            Pro Surfing competition, Winter and Summer X-games, marathons, 10k runs, bicycle races,
            volleyball tournaments and other health and sports related activities, including
            extreme sports, particularly supercross, motocross, freestyle, surfing, skateboarding,
            wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, BMX, mountain biking, snowmobile racing, and also
            participate in product demonstrations, food tasting and other related events. In store
            posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising together with price
            promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands.

Additionally, in 2003 we entered into a multi-year sponsorship agreement
            to advertise on the new Las Vegas Monorail (“Monorail Agreement”) with the
            Las Vegas Monorail Company (“LVMC”) which includes the right to vend our
            Monster Energy®

drinks and natural sodas on all stations. The
            initial term of the Monorail Agreement commenced on January 1, 2005 and has been
            renewed annually thereafter, with renewals at a lower annual rate. We have renewed the
            agreement for 2008.


We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is
            differentiation such as making our products visually distinctive from other beverages
            on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis
            and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels
            and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize
            their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores and we will
            continue to reevaluate the same from time to time.

Where appropriate we partner with retailers to assist our marketing
            efforts. For example, while we retain responsibility for the marketing of the Juice
            Slam® line of children's multi-vitamin juice drinks, Costco has undertaken partial
            responsibility for the marketing of the Juice Blast® line.

We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by
            approximately 48% in 2007 compared to 2006. As of December 31, 2007, we employed 713
            employees in sales and marketing activities, of which 269 were employed on a full-time
            basis.

Customers

Our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains,
            wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full
            service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers.
            Gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 2007, 2006 and
            2005 are reflected below. The allocations below reflect changes made by us to the
            categories historically reported.

Our customers include Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group (formally known
            as Dr. Pepper Bottling/7UP Bottling Group), Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s
            Club), AB, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi
            Canada, Swire Coca-Cola, USA, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and Albertsons. A
            decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease
            carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition
            and consolidated results of operations. Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group, a customer of
            the DSD division, accounted for approximately 16%, 19% and 18% of our net sales for the
            years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including
            Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for
            approximately 12% of our net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and
            2006, respectively.

Seasonality

Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second
            and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of
            sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions. Sales of our
            beverage products may become increasingly subject to seasonal fluctuations as more
            sales occur outside of California with respect to our products. However, the energy
            drink category appears to be less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the
            percentage of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase,
            seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be
            affected by other factors, including the introduction of new products, the opening of
            new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new
            bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of sales of our finished products and
            changes in and/or increased advertising, marketing and promotional expenses.


Intellectual Property

We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business.
            Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or
            their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become
            generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks
            are in use. We also own the copyright in and to numerous statements made and content
            appearing on the packaging of our products.

We own the Hansen’s®, Monster Energy®, M (stylized)®
            and the M Monster Energy® trademarks. These trademarks are crucial to our business
            and are registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in various countries
            throughout the world. We own a number of other trademark registrations including, but
            not limited to, A New Kind a Buzz®, Unleash the Beast!®, Hansen’s
            Energy®, Blue Energy®, Energade®, Hansen’s E

            Soda® in the United States and, the Monster®, Monster Energy®,
            M(stylized)®, Hansen’s® and Smoothie® trademarks in a number of
            countries around the world.

We have applied to register a number of trademarks in the United States
            and elsewhere including, but not limited to, Monster™, Monster Energy™,
            M(stylized)™, Assault™, Khaos™, Monster M-80™, Predator™,
            M Monster Mutant™, Joker Mad Energy™, Ace™, Rumba™,

            MIXXD™, Monster Heavy Metal™ and Energy Pro™.

In September 2000, in connection with the acquisition of the Blue Sky
            Natural Beverage business, we acquired the Blue Sky® trademark which is registered
            in the United States and Canada, through our wholly owned subsidiary Blue
            Sky.

In May 2001, in connection with the acquisition of the Junior Juice
            beverage business, we acquired the Junior Juice® trademark, which is registered in
            the United States, through our wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice.

In October 2006, we acquired the Unbound Energy® trademark which is
            registered in the United States.

Government Regulation

The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of
            our products is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary
            Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act;
            various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and
            regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising,
            labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific
            warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the State of
            California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all
            food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their
            products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds
            below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed
            components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products
            containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are
            contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from
            the warning requirement. While none of our beverage products are required to display
            warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our
            products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to
            predict whether, or to what extent, a warning under this law would have an impact on
            costs or sales of our products.


Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require
            that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise
            requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product
            stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in
            Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in
            the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and
            elsewhere.

Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and
            local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had,
            and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our
            capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we employed a total of 904 employees of which
            448 were employed on a full-time basis. Of our 904 employees, we employ 191 in
            administrative and operational capacities and 713 persons in sales and marketing
            capacities. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider relations with
            our employees to be good.

Compliance with Environmental Laws

In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our
            customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of
            Conservation based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and
            non-carbonated products sold.

In certain other states and Canada
            where Hansen’s® products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits
            from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective state agencies based
            upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products
            sold in such states.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information in this report, you should
            carefully consider the following risks. If any of the following risks actually occur,
            our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially
            adversely affected. The risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face.
            Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem
            to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
            and/or operating results.

Increased competition could hurt our business.

The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of
            competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and
            marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a
            relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater
            financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.

Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include
            taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective
            development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging,
            branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid
            refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed
            competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known
            producers such as The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo Inc., Cadbury Schweppes plc, Red Bull
            Gmbh, Kraft Foods Inc., Nestle Beverage Company, Tree Top and Ocean Spray. We also
            compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products
            also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains,
            convenience store chains, and club stores. Our Java Monster™ line of
            non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks competes directly with Starbucks Frappuccino
            and other coffee drinks, Rockstar Roasted, Caribou Coffee, Cinnabon coffee drinks and
            Godiva dairy based drinks.

There can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in
            maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the
            beverage industry. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and
            results of operations could be adversely affected.

We derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks
            and competitive pressure in the “energy drink” category could adversely
            affect our operating results.

A substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks,
            including in particular our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Our DSD segment
            which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 89.5% of net sales for the year
            ended December 31, 2007. Any decrease in the sales of our Monster Energy® brand
            energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income.
            Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the
            energy drink category. Our energy drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full
            Throttle, No Fear, Amp, Adrenaline Rush, 180, Extreme Energy Shot, Red Devil, Rip It,
            Nos, Boo Koo, Vitaminenergy and many other brands. A number of companies who market and
            distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages, such as 16- and
            20-ounce glass bottles, including Sobe, Snapple Elements, Arizona, Fuse, and Vitamin
            Water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products
            as “functional” or “energy” beverages or as having functional
            benefits. In addition, certain large companies such as The Coca-Cola Company and
            PepsiCo Inc. market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as Pepsi
            Max, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew MDX and Vault. Competitive pressures in the energy
            drink category could impact our revenues or we could experience price erosion or lower
            market share, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and
            results.

Change in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our
            products.

There is increasing awareness and concern for the health consequences of
            obesity. This may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our
            profitability.


Consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future
            success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce
            different and innovative beverages. In order to retain and expand our market share, we
            must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be
            competitive in the areas of quality and health, although there can be no assurance of
            our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase
            our products in the future. Additionally, many of our products are considered premium
            products and to maintain market share during recessionary periods we may have to reduce
            profit margins which would adversely affect our results of operations. Product
            lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a
            few years before consumers' preferences change. The beverages we currently market are
            in varying stages of their lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages
            will become or remain profitable for us. The beverage industry is subject to changing
            consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we
            misjudge such preferences. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product
            and packaging initiatives. We also may be unable to penetrate new markets. If our
            revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be
            adversely affected.

We rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our
            products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and
            contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained
            or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.

We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such
            manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. Although our production
            arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request, in the
            event of a disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing
            facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
            period. In addition, there are limited packing facilities in the United States with
            adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including
            Hansen’s® brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, our PET tea line,
            Hansens® Sparkling beverages in 10.5-ounce sleek cans, aseptic juice products,
            juices in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles, Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy™,
            Ace™, Unbound Energy®, Rumba

TM

and Joker Mad Energy

TM

energy drinks in 8.3-ounce, 16-ounce, 24-ounce and 32-ounce cans, our Java
            Monster

TM

line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks in 15-ounce cans
            and other products. A disruption or delay in production of any of such products could
            significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing
            facilities in the United States with adequate capacity may not be available for such
            products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time
            period, if at all. Consequently, a disruption in production of such products could
            adversely affect our revenues.

We rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our DSD products.
            If we are unable to secure such bottlers and distributors and/or we are unable to
            maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors, our business
            could suffer.

We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering
            into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors
            having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. Many of our
            bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other
            soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and
            non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. In many cases, such products compete directly
            with our products.

The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success.
            If our DSD brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors
            and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers
            and/or distributors do not market and promote our products above the products of our
            competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
            adversely affected.


Our customers are material to our success. If we are unable to
            maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could
            suffer.

Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, and/or
            convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other
            customers to discontinue carrying all or any of the our products that they are carrying
            at any time, which could cause our business to suffer.

Two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 12%, and 19% and 12%
            of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. One
            customer accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales for the year ended December
            31, 2005. A decision by either customer, or any other large customer, to decrease the
            amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material
            adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of
            operations.

Increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs
            of co-packing could harm our business.

The principal raw materials used by us comprise aluminum cans, glass
            bottles and PET plastic bottles as well as juices, sucrose, cane sugar, sucralose, milk
            and cream, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. Due to the consolidations
            that have taken place in the glass industry over the past few years, the prices of
            glass bottles continue to increase. The prices of PET plastic bottles and certain
            aluminum cans increased in 2007. The prices of glucose, high fructose corn syrup, milk,
            cream and certain juice concentrates, including apple, increased significantly in 2007.
            These increased costs, together with increased costs primarily of energy and gas and
            freight resulted in increases in certain product costs, which are ongoing and are
            expected to continue to exert pressure on our gross margins in 2008. In addition,
            certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges
            based on certain of their own cost increases. We are uncertain whether the prices of
            any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients will continue to rise in the
            future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our
            customers.

In addition, some of these raw materials, such as a sucralose and
            certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers. Sucralose,
            which is used in many of our products including our low-calorie products, is purchased
            by us from a single manufacturer. While we believe that our 2008 sucralose volume
            allocation will be sufficient to meet the demand for our products that contain
            sucralose, we may need to reformulate certain of those products that contain sucralose
            with alternative sweetener systems to avoid an interruption in supply of those
            products, should the need arise.

Due to significant cost increases mainly for apple juice concentrate and
            PET plastic bottles, we are currently negotiating a mutually acceptable early
            termination of the WIC Contracts with the State of California. We have been informed
            that future contracts will not be granted on an exclusive basis and that certain
            manufacturers (including HBC) will be eligible to sell certain qualifying products to
            WIC participants. The Company is informed and believes that the WIC program intends
            reducing the total quantity of fruit juice products that will be available to WIC
            participants. We anticipate that as a consequence of the above, our revenue from these
            products is likely to be lower in the future.

Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could
            adversely affect our business and financial results.

We may not correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to
            estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may
            be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we
            materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient
            ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, PET plastic bottles, cans,
            glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners, or packing
            arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover,
            industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have
            been and could, from time to time in the future, be


experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of
            certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and
            financial results. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to
            manage this risk.

The costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from
            time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our
            customers.

Many of our packaging supplies contracts allow our suppliers to alter
            the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the
            underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as resin
            for PET bottles, aluminum for cans, pulp for cartons and/or trays. These changes in the
            prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary
            by product and supplier. Accordingly, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of
            these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that
            comprise these packaging supplies. We do not use derivative instruments to manage this
            risk. If the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these
            costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge,
            which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers.
            If we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we
            could suffer disruptions in our business.

Generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their
            flavors. Consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our
            flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to
            obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice.
            Industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have
            been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, which could interfere
            with and/or delay production of certain of our products. If we have to replace a flavor
            supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products
            to our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
            operations.

Our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, the
            loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business.

We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. We
            also own the copyright in and to portion of the content on the packaging of our
            products. We regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as
            critical to our success and attempt to protect such property with registered and common
            law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent
            infringement. Product packages, mechanical designs and artwork are important to our
            success and we take action to protect against imitation of our packaging and trade
            dress and to protect our trademarks and copyrights as necessary. However, there can be
            no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our
            trademarks and similar proprietary rights. If we lose some or all of our intellectual
            property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected.

Significant changes in government regulation may hinder
            sales.

The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of
            our products is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary
            Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act;
            various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and
            regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising,
            labeling and ingredients of such products. New statutes and regulations may also be
            instituted in the future. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future
            product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be
            fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or packaging
            changed, thus adversely affecting our financial condition and operations. California
            law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component
            listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth
            defects. While none of our beverage products are required to display warnings under
            this law, we cannot predict whether


an
            important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the
            future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this
            law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.

If we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we
            encounter product recalls, our business may suffer.

Our success depends on our ability to maintain and build brand image for
            our existing products, new products and brand extensions. We have no assurance that our
            advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our
            products' brand image and on consumer preferences. Product quality issues, real or
            imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if fake or unfounded, could
            tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other
            products. We may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from
            specific co-packers, markets or batches. Product recalls could adversely affect our
            profitability and our brand image. We do not maintain recall insurance.

While we have to date not experienced any credible product liability
            litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the
            future. In the event we were to experience product liability claims or a product
            recall, our financial condition and business operations could be materially adversely
            effected.

If we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable
            to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or if our retailer's
            inventory levels are too high, our operating results will be adversely
            affected.

If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular
            product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not
            be appropriate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to
            meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or
            retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or
            lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to
            maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our
            products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place
            orders for additional products, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and
            adversely affect our operating results.

If we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior
            management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating
            performance until we find suitable replacements.

Our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our
            senior management. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any members of our
            senior management. We currently have employment agreements with Mr. Sacks, Chairman and
            Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Schlosberg, President and Chief Financial Officer,
            which end on December 31, 2008. The loss of services of either of these persons or any
            other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until
            suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of personnel with the
            requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ
            such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.

Weather could adversely affect our supply chain and demand for our
            products.

With regard to fruit juice, fruit juice concentrates and natural
            flavors, the beverage industry is subject to variability of weather conditions, which
            may result in higher prices and/or the nonavailability of any of such items. Sales of
            our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets
            in which we operate, particularly in areas outside of California. Weather conditions
            may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse
            effect on our results of operations.


Potential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may
            adversely affect our financial results.

We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards
            or practices may have on our financial results. New accounting standards could be
            issued that could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
            These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings.
            Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income.
            Equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the
            disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products' affordability and reduce
            our sales.

Volatility of stock price may restrict sale
            opportunities.

Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including
            stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and
            our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by
            the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other factors,
            many of which are beyond our control. We may be unable to achieve analysts’
            earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product
            types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others. There can
            be no assurance that the Company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product
            sales. As a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and
            stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. During our fiscal
            year ended December 31, 2007, our stock price high was $68.40 and stock price low was
            $32.50.

Provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders
            may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other
            stockholders.

Our organizational documents may limit changes in control. Furthermore,
            on February 7, 2008, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg together may be deemed to control a
            maximum of 20.9% of our outstanding common stock. Consequently, Mr. Sacks and Mr.
            Schlosberg could exercise significant control on matters submitted to a vote of our
            stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and
            disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such
            actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders.

Our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term
            goals.

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital
            expenditure plans and general operating activities. In addition, the terms and/or
            availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors could affect
            the financing of our future growth.

Our
            investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and
            affect the liquidity of these investments.

At December 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash
            equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. We have
            historically invested these amounts in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities
            (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper
            and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are
            subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be
            exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of
            the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks
            associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our
            future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Our long-term investments are comprised of municipal or educational
            related or other public body notes with an auction reset feature (“auction rate
            securities”). These notes carry a AAA credit rating and certain of the notes are
            additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies.
            Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process
            which


allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest
            rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. In February 2008, a
            large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. There is no
            assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment
            portfolio will succeed. The auction failures appear to have been attributable to
            inadequate buyers and/or buying demand. In the event that there is a failed auction,
            the indenture governing the security generally requires the issuer to pay interest at a
            default rate that is above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for
            which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the predetermined
            default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until the auction succeeds, the
            issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third
            parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of
            our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, these
            securities have been classified as long-term investments in our consolidated financial
            statements. However, we anticipate that due to the higher interest rates now payable on
            certain of these securities and for other reasons, the issuers will take steps to
            refinance their notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore
            avoid the higher interest rates now payable on such securities.

If the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance
            their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit
            ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on
            these investments. We may be required to wait until market stability is restored for
            these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to
            40 years) to realize our investments’ recorded value. (See “Part II,
            Item 7A. - Qualitative And Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks” and
            “Part II, Item 8, Note 2 – Short- and Long-Term Investments” in our
            consolidated financial statements).

If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures
            and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price
            and investor confidence in our Company could be materially and adversely
            affected.

We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and
            internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described
            in Part II, Item 9A. If we fail to do so, our business, results of operations or
            financial condition and the value of our stock could be materially harmed.

Legal proceedings related to our historical stock option grant
            practices and other issues may significantly harm our business.

Several lawsuits have been filed against us and current officers and
            members of the Board of Directors in connection with our prior stock option practices.
            These lawsuits are described more fully in Part I, Item 3. “Legal
            Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8, Note 9 to our consolidated financial
            statements contained in this Form 10-K. Defending these lawsuits will result in
            significant ongoing expenditures and the continued diversion of our management's time
            and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on
            our business operations.

Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant
            liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.

We are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and
            legal proceedings, which could adversely affect our financial results.

Our business may be negatively impacted by a slowing economy or by
            unfavorable economic conditions or developments in the United States and/or in other
            countries in which we operate.

A general slowdown in the economy in the United States or unfavorable
            economic conditions or other developments may result in decreased consumer demand,
            business disruption, supply constraints,


foreign currency devaluation, inflation or deflation. A slowdown in the
            economy or unstable economic conditions in the United States or in the countries in
            which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business results or financial
            condition. Our foreign sales accounted for 4.0%, 2.8% and 1.3% of our gross sales for
            the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

PROPERTIES

In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased
            offices located in Corona, California. In October 2006, we also entered into a lease
            agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution
            space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental
            payments for 120 months commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly
            rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the
            lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and
            distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located
            in Corona, California.

In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of
            vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. The property is located adjacent to
            the new leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of
            constructing a new office building on such land, which will replace the Company’s
            existing office space.

We have sublet in excess of 50% of our previous office, warehouse and
            distribution space for the remainder of that lease term, which expires in October
            2010.

We also rent additional warehouse space on a short-term basis from time
            to time in public warehouses situated throughout the United States and
            Canada.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Litigation

– In August 2006, HBC
            filed a lawsuit against National Beverage Company, Shasta Beverages, Inc., Newbevco
            Inc. and Freek’N Beverage Corp. (collectively “National”) seeking an
            injunction and damages for trademark infringement, trademark dilution, unfair
            competition and deceptive trade practices based on National’s unauthorized use of
            HBC’s valuable and distinctive Monster Energy® trade dress in connection with
            a line of energy drinks it launched under the “Freek” brand name. In June
            2007, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement resolving the
            parties’ disputes in the litigation. National subsequently repudiated the
            settlement agreement and HBC responded by filing a motion in the United States District
            Court for the Central District of California to enforce the terms of the confidential
            settlement agreement. On August 14, 2007, the United States District Court entered an
            Order enforcing the settlement agreement and permanently enjoining National from
            manufacturing, distributing, shipping, marketing, selling and offering to sell
            “Freek” energy drinks in containers using the original “Freek”
            trade dress that was subject to the District Court’s preliminary injunction.
            National filed a notice of appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of the United
            States. National requested the District Court to stay this Order pending its appeal to
            the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which was subsequently denied by the
            District Court. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet docketed
            National’s appeal.

In August 2006, HBC filed an action in the Federal Courts of Australia,
            Victoria District Registry against Bickfords Australia (Pty) Limited and Meak (Pty)
            Ltd. (collectively “Bickfords”), in which HBC is seeking an injunction
            restraining Bickfords from selling or offering for sale or promoting


for
            sale in Australia any energy drink or beverage under the Monster Energy or Monster
            marks or any similar marks and for damages and costs. The defendants cross-claimed
            seeking an order to restrain HBC from selling, or offering for sale, or promoting in
            Australia any drink product under the Monster Energy® or Monster® trademarks or
            any similar trademarks and for costs. The trial took place in February 2007 and closing
            oral submissions took place in June 2007. The Judge has not rendered his decision in
            the case to date.

In September 2006, Christopher Chavez purporting to act on behalf of
            himself and a class of consumers yet to be defined filed an action in the United States
            District Court, Northern District of California, against the Company and its
            subsidiaries for unfair business practices, false advertising, violation of California
            Consumers Legal Remedies Act, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation alleging that the
            Company misleadingly labels its Blue Sky beverages as originating in and/or being
            canned under the authority of a company located in Santa Fe, New Mexico. On June 11,
            2007, the United States District Court, Northern District of California granted the
            Company’s motion to dismiss Chavez’s complaint with prejudice. In late
            June, Mr. Chavez noticed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth
            Circuit. Mr. Chavez, as the appellant, has filed his opening brief and Hansen’s
            response has also been filed. The appeal has not been scheduled for hearing.

During 2007, Gate City Beverage Company (“Gate City”),
            notified the Company of its intention to sell its business and requested that the
            Company consent to the assignment of the distribution agreement with the Company. 
            The Company declined its consent and exercised its contractual right to terminate the
            Gate City distribution agreement in accordance with its terms.  Gate City has
            disputed the Company’s right to refuse consent and to terminate the agreement and
            on February 6, 2008, filed arbitration proceedings to be held in Orange County,
            California against the Company for damages.  The Company disputes liability and is
            defending the claim.

We are subject to litigation from time to time in the normal course of
            business, including claims from terminated distributors. Although it is not possible to
            predict the outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to us and after
            consultation with counsel, management believes that such litigation in the aggregate
            will likely not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of
            operations.

Derivative Litigation

- From November 2006
            through January 2007, purported derivative lawsuits relating to the Company’s
            past stock option grants were filed by parties identifying themselves as shareholders
            of Hansen. These lawsuits name as defendants certain of Hansen’s current and
            former employees, officers and directors, and name Hansen as a nominal defendant. Three
            of these cases, Chandler v. Sacks, et al. (No. RIC460186), Plotkin v. Sacks, et al.
            (No. RIC460485), and Alama v. Sacks, et al. (No. RIC463968), were filed in the Superior
            Court of California, County of Riverside. Two additional shareholder derivative
            lawsuits, Linan v. Sacks, et al. (No. ED CV 06-01393) and Cribbs v. Blower et al. (No.
            ED CV 07-00037), were filed in the United States District Court for the Central
            District of California. On March 26, 2007, the Cribbs and Linan actions were
            consolidated for all purposes before the District Court, which appointed lead and local
            counsel and restyled the action as In re Hansen Natural Corporation Derivative
            Litigation (No. ED CV 07-37 JFW (PLAx)) (the “Federal Derivative Action”).
            On April 23, 2007, the Federal Derivative Action plaintiffs filed an amended
            consolidated complaint. On April 16, 2007, the Alama v. Sacks, et al. lawsuit filed in
            California Superior Court was voluntarily dismissed. On May 23, 2007, Alama filed a
            substantially similar complaint in the Chancery Court of Delaware, New Castle County
            (No. 2978) (the “Delaware Derivative Action”). Pursuant to a stipulation
            among the parties that was so ordered by the Court on May 25, 2007, the Chandler and
            Plotkin actions filed in the Superior Court of California were consolidated (the
            “California Derivative Action”) and were stayed for all purposes until
            February 29, 2008.

Plaintiffs in each of the Federal Derivative Action, the Delaware
            Derivative Action and the California Derivative Action, who purport to bring suit on
            behalf of the Company, have made no demand on the Board of Directors and allege that
            such demand is excused. The complaints in the derivative actions generally allege,
            among other things, that by improperly dating certain Hansen stock option


grants, defendants breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate
            assets, unjustly enriched themselves and violated federal and California statutes.
            Plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified damages to be paid to Hansen,
            corporate governance reforms, an accounting, rescission, restitution and the creation
            of a constructive trust.

In the Summer of 2007, the Company and the individual defendants moved
            to dismiss the Federal Derivative Action and the Delaware Derivative Action.
            Thereafter, the parties to the Federal Derivative Action and the Delaware Derivative
            Action engaged in settlement negotiations, and have now entered into a Stipulation and
            Agreement of Settlement dated February 25, 2008 (the “Stipulation”)
            providing for the settlement and dismissal of the Federal Derivative Action and the
            Delaware Derivative Action (the “Settlement”). The Stipulation was filed
            with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on February 25,
            2008. The Settlement is subject to the U.S. District Court’s approval following a
            hearing at which shareholders will have the opportunity to object. The District Court
            will then decide whether to approve the Settlement as fair, adequate and in the best
            interest of Hansen’s shareholders. On February 28, 2008, the District Court
            preliminarily approved the Settlement and scheduled the settlement hearing for May 5,
            2008. There can be no guarantee that the Settlement will be finalized and receive the
            required approval from the District Court.

As part of the Settlement, the Company has agreed to maintain certain
            previously adopted changes relating to its stock option granting procedures, and to
            adopt certain other changes in its procedures and corporate governance practices (the
            “Corporate Reforms”). Hansen has agreed to keep these Corporate Reforms in
            place for a period of at least two years, subject to certain conditions. The Settlement
            further provides for plaintiffs’ counsel to apply to the Court for an award of
            attorneys’ fees in the amount of $437,500. The Company has agreed not to object
            to this application. All attorneys’ fees will be paid exclusively by the
            Company’s insurance carrier. Aside from attorneys’ fees, the Settlement
            contemplates no payments by or to the Company or by the individual
            defendants.

Under the Settlement, plaintiffs will give a full release on behalf of
            the Company and its shareholders covering all claims that were or could have been
            brought in the Federal and Delaware Derivative Actions as well as all claims that arise
            out of or are based upon or relate to the allegations, transactions or facts involved
            in the complaints filed in those actions. The defendants make no admission of
            wrongdoing under the Settlement and expressly deny each and every claim and allegation
            made against them in the derivative actions, including, but not limited to, any
            allegation of manipulation or illegal backdating of stock options.

Securities Litigation

- From November 2006
            through December 2006, several plaintiffs filed shareholder class actions in the United
            States District Court for the Central District of California against Hansen and certain
            of its employees, officers and directors, entitled Hutton v. Hansen Natural Corp., et
            al. (No. 06-07599), Kingery v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-07771), Williams v.
            Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-01369), Ziolkowski v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al.
            (No. ED 06-01403), Walker v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-08229) (the
            “Class Actions”). On February 27, 2007, the Class Actions were consolidated
            by the District Court and styled as In re Hansen Natural Corporation Securities
            Litigation (CV06-07599 JFW (PLAx)). The Court appointed Jason E. Peltier as lead
            plaintiff (“Lead Plaintiff”) and approved lead counsel. Lead Plaintiff
            filed a consolidated class action complaint on April 30, 2007.

The consolidated class action complaint superseded all previously filed
            class action complaints and became the operative complaint to which the Company had to
            respond. Lead Plaintiff alleged, on behalf of all persons who purchased Hansen common
            stock during the period beginning November 12, 2001 through November 9, 2006 (the
            “Class Period”), that Hansen and the individual defendants (collectively,
            the “Defendants”) made misleading statements and omissions of material fact
            which artificially inflated the market price of Hansen common stock throughout the
            Class Period. Plaintiffs further allege that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and
            20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
            Act”), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by misrepresenting or


failing to disclose that defendants incorrectly dated stock option
            grants, that the Company’s internal controls were inadequate, and that, as a
            result, defendants engaged in improper accounting practices. Plaintiff sought an
            unspecified amount of damages.

On June 25, 2007, the Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated class
            action complaint. On October 16, 2007, the District Court granted the Defendants’
            motions to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint with prejudice and without
            leave to amend. The Court then entered final judgment in favor of the Defendants, and
            the time within which to appeal the judgment has expired.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The consolidated statements of operations data set forth below with
            respect to each of the years ended December 31, 2003 through 2007 and the balance sheet
            data as of December 31, for the years indicated, are derived from our audited
            consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those
            financial statements and notes thereto, and with the Management’s Discussion and
            Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included as Part II, Item 7
            of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


*Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator
            of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales,
            which is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the
            United States of America (“GAAP”), and should not be used alone as an
            indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may
            not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales
            has been defined by the Company’s internal reporting requirements. However, gross
            sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales
            performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines
            and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales
            performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain
            performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more
            comprehensive presentation of the Company’s operating performance. Gross sales
            may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances
            may be deducted from payments received from customers (See “Part II, Item 7 -
            Results of Operations”).

Our Business

Overview

We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative”
            beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and
            energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and “functional drinks,”
            non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks,
            Junior Juice® juices and flavored sparkling beverages under the Hansen’s®
            brand name. We also develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the
            following brand names; Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy™, Joker Mad
            Energy™, Unbound Energy® and Ace™ brand names as well as Rumba™
            brand energy juice. We also market, sell and distribute the Java Monster™ line of
            non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, natural sodas, premium natural sodas with
            supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks
            under the Blue Sky® brand name. Our fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under
            the Junior Juice® brand name. We also market, sell and distribute vitamin and
            mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the Fizzit™ brand name.

We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products
            comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based
            and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily
            through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops,
            markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers.

Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages and drink mixes
            is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both
            in stores and at events. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at
            events where we sample our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull”
            methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and
            maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store
            promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize
            promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and
            extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as
            cancer research and SPCAs, as well as extreme sports teams such as the Pro Circuit
            – Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross and
            Supercross teams, Robby Gordon Racing Team, Kawasaki Factory International Moto GP
            Team, Kenny Bernstein Drag Racing Team, extreme sports figures and athletes, sporting
            events such as the Monster Energy®

Supercross Series, the
            Monster Energy®

Pro Pipeline surfing competition, Winter and
            Summer X-Games, marathons, 10k runs, bicycle races, volleyball tournaments and other
            health and sports related activities, including extreme sports, particularly
            supercross, motocross, freestyle, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing,
            snowboarding, BMX, mountain biking, snowmobile racing, etc., and we also participate in
            product demonstrations, food tasting and other related events. In store posters,
            outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price
            promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands.


We believe that one of the keys to success in the
            beverage industry is differentiation, such as making Hansen’s® products
            visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We

review
            our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make
            them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are
            redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever
            they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to
            time.

During 2007, we continued to expand our existing product lines and
            further develop our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and
            marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the
            “alternative” beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type
            drinks.

During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Off-Premise
            Agreements with AB. Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select AB Distributors distribute
            and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s Monster Energy® and Lost®
            Energy

TM

brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, Rumba™ brand energy juice
            and Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks, as well as additional products that may be
            agreed between the parties. We intend to continue building our national distributor
            network primarily with select AB distributors as well as with our sales force
            throughout 2007 to support and grow the sales of our products.

On April 28, 2006, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with
            Cadbury Bebidas for exclusive distribution by Cadbury Bebidas throughout Mexico,
            excluding Baja California, of our Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy™
            energy products.

On February 8, 2007, HBC entered into the On-Premise Agreement with AB.
            Under the On-Premise Agreement, AB will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution
            and merchandising of Monster Energy® energy drinks to on-premise retailers
            including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by HBC.

On March 1, 2007, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with Pepsi
            Canada for the exclusive distribution by Pepsi Canada throughout Canada of our Monster
            Energy®, Lost® Energy™ and Hansen’s® energy
            products.

As discussed under Review of Historic Stock Option Granting Practices in
            Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
            Results of Operations”, included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
            December 31, 2006, and Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
            Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, included in our Form 10-Q for the
            quarter ended March 31, 2007, a special committee of our Board of Directors concluded
            its review of our stock option grants and granting practices. In connection with this
            review, related litigation and other related matters, we incurred professional service
            fees of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million
            for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No related costs were
            incurred for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for
            the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:


As a result of the late filings of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
            September 30, 2006, our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and our
            Form 10-Q for the three-months ended March 31, 2007, we will be ineligible to register
            our securities on Form S-3 for sale by us or resale by others until we have been
            current in our reporting obligations for a period of approximately one year. We expect
            to be eligible to register our securities on Form S-3 after July 1, 2008. The inability
            to use Form S-3 could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period.
            However, we are still eligible to register our securities on Form S-1. If we fail to
            timely file a future periodic report with the SEC and our stock were to be delisted, it
            could severely impact our ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse
            impact on our overall future liquidity.

We again achieved record gross sales in 2007. The increase in gross
            sales in 2007 was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of certain of our
            existing products, particularly our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and to
            sales by volume or our Java Monster

TM

line of non-carbonated dairy based
            coffee drinks. The percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage
            increase in net sales, primarily due to a decrease in promotional and other allowances
            as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 13.0% to 11.8%. The actual amount
            of promotional and other allowances increased to $121.3 million from $90.5 million for
            the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster
            Energy® brand energy drinks. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy® brand
            energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income.
            Competitive pressure in the “energy drink” category could adversely affect
            our operating results. (See “Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors”)

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase for our
            Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of
            non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that
            approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were
            attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price
            increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our
            existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. As a result, our future sales and operating
            results may be negatively impacted as a result of higher than normal distribution
            channel inventory levels. (See “Part I, Item 1A. - Risk
            Factors”)

Gross sales shipped outside of California represented 72.0%, 67.8% and
            61.5% of our gross sales, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
            respectively. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $41.0
            million, $19.3 million and $5.6 million for the years ended


December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such sales were
            approximately 4.0%, 2.8% and 1.3% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2007,
            2006 and 2005, respectively.

Our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains,
            wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full
            service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers.
            Gross sales to our various customer types for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are reflected below.
            The allocations below reflect changes made by the Company to the categories
            historically reported.

Our customers include Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group (formally known
            as Dr. Pepper Bottling/7UP Bottling Group), Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s
            Club), AB, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi
            Canada, Swire Coca-Cola, USA, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and Albertsons. A
            decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to
            cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial
            condition and consolidated results of operations. Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group, a
            customer of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 16%, 19% and 18% of our net
            sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Wal-Mart,
            Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions,
            accounted for approximately 12% of the Company’s net sales for each of the years
            ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In October 2006, we acquired the Unbound Energy®

trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of Unbound
            Energy

®

energy

drinks in 16-ounce cans. We subsequently introduced a lo-carb and juice
            version in 16-ounce cans.

During 2004, we entered into exclusive WIC Contracts with the State of
            California to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce PET plastic
            bottles. The WIC Contracts commenced on July 12, 2004 and were due to expire in July
            2007. The parties mutually agreed to extend the WIC Contracts until July 11, 2008.
            WIC-approved items are stocked by the grocery trade and by WIC-only stores. Products
            are purchased by WIC consumers with vouchers given by the DHS to qualified
            participants. Due to significant cost increases mainly for apple juice concentrates and
            PET plastic bottles, we are currently negotiating a mutually acceptable earlier
            termination of the WIC Contracts with the State of California. We have been informed
            that future WIC contracts will not be granted on an exclusive basis and that certain
            manufacturers (including HBC) will be eligible to sell certain qualifying products to
            WIC participants. The Company is informed and believes that the WIC program intends
            reducing the total quantity of fruit juice products that will be available to WIC
            participants. We anticipate that as a consequence of the above, our revenue from these
            products is likely to be lower in the future. However, we do not believe that such
            reduction in revenue will have a material impact on our future operations. (See
            “Part I, Item 1. Business – Manufacture and
            Distribution”).

We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and
            introduction of new products and flavors.

Value Drivers of our Business

We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the
            following:

•

Profitable Growth

–
                            We believe functional, better for you brands properly supported by
                            marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive
                            profitable growth. We


continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are
            expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more
            alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe
            that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable
            growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable
            growth.

•

Cost Management

– The
                            principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and
                            cost reduction. One key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw
                            material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as
                            a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is
                            the reduction in inventory levels. However, due to the expansion in the
                            number of our products, increased sales levels in 2007, and the
                            conclusion of the agreements with AB, overall inventory levels
                            increased. During 2007, the costs of PET plastic bottles and certain
                            aluminum cans, as well as the costs of glucose, high fructose corn
                            syrup, certain juice concentrates, including apple, and certain
                            packaging and freight costs also increased.

•

Efficient Capital Structure

– Our capital structure is intended to optimize
                            our costs of capital. We believe our strong capital position, our
                            ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and overall
                            low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage.

We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw
            materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result
            in (1) maintaining our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time
            through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing
            our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our
            current and future results of operations.

Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income and
            net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. In 2007,
            gross sales totaled $1,025.8 million, a 47.3% increase over 2006. Net sales totaled
            $904.5 million in 2007, an increase of 49.3% over 2006. Gross profit totaled $468.0
            million in 2007, a 47.8% increase from 2006. Operating income totaled $231.0 million in
            2007, an increase of 45.7% from 2006. Net income totaled $149.4 million in 2007, a
            52.5% increase from 2006. Net income per diluted share was $1.51 as compared to net
            income per diluted share of $0.99 in 2006. These measurements will continue to be a key

            December 31, 2006.”

In 2007, the Company had working capital of $187.3 million compared to
            $212.3 million as of December 31, 2006. In 2007, our net cash provided by operating
            activities was approximately $135.5 million as compared to $76.4 million in 2006.
            Principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts
            receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademarks.
            Payment of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our
            principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (See also “Part II,
            Item 7. - Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and
            risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Increase in
            consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and
            inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and
            serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad
            product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and
            juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to
            meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and
            variety.


Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of
            different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our
            continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although
            there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our
            market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative
            beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution,
            brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to
            changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect
            companies that misjudge such preferences.

In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our
            company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to:

•

the impact of the slowing economy in the United States
                            and other countries in which we operate;

•

maintenance of our brand images and product
                            quality;

•

profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands
                            in the competitive market place (See also “Part I, Item 1. -
                            Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing”);

•

restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or
                            tariffs; changes in government regulations;

•

protection of our existing intellectual property
                            portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and
                            innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines;

•

limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a
                            non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products,
                            due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier’s
                            production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of
                            certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce
                            can and copacking availability;

•

the imposition of additional restrictions.

(See also “Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors”)
                            for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our
                            Company.

We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:

•

growth potential for the alternative beverage category
                            including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks,
                            juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water;

•

new product introductions intended to contribute to
                            higher profitability;

•

premium packages intended to generate strong revenue
                            growth;

•

significant package, pricing and channel opportunities
                            to maximize profitable growth;

•

proper positioning to capture industry growth;
                            and

•

broadening distribution/expansion
                            opportunities.


Results of Operations

*

Gross sales, although used internally
            by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an
            alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not
            be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales.
            Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
            other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements.
            However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including
            sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or
            declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales
            performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain
            performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more
            comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be
            realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be
            deducted from payments received from customers.

**

Although the expenditures described
            in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements,
            the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements.
            Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be
            comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of
            promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the
            determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such
            sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing
            activities.


Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007
            Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006

Gross Sales.*

Gross sales were $1,025.8
            million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $329.5
            million or 47.3% higher than gross sales of $696.3 million for the year ended December
            31, 2006. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by
            volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster
            Energy® drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks
            (introduced in August 2003), Monster Energy® Assault

TM

energy drinks
            (introduced in September 2004) and Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks
            (introduced in August 2005), as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java
            Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April
            2007), Monster M-80

TM

energy drinks (introduced in March 2007), Monster
            MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Heavy Metal™
            energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). To a lesser extent, the increase in gross
            sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends,
            aseptic juices, Unbound Energy

®

energy drinks (introduced in October 2006) and Junior Juice® aseptic
            juices. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume
            of Lost Energy® drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Joker Mad
            Energy™ drinks (introduced in January 2005) and Hansen's® fruit juice
            smoothies. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in gross
            sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007,
            we announced a price increase for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our
            Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January
            1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth
            quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of
            such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $121.3 million for
            2007, an increase of $30.8 million or 34.0% higher than promotional and other
            allowances of $90.5 million for 2006. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage
            of gross sales decreased to 11.8% in 2007 from 13.0% in 2006. As a result, the
            percentage increase in gross sales in 2007 was lower than the percentage increase in
            net sales.

*Gross sales – see definition above.

Net Sales.

Net sales were $904.5 million
            for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $298.7 million or
            49.3% higher than net sales of $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
            increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our
            Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks,
            lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® Assault™ energy drinks
            and Monster Energy® Khaos™ energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new
            products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
            drinks, Monster M-80™ energy drinks, Monster MIXXD™ energy drinks and
            Monster Heavy Metal™ energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales
            was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic
            juices, sodas and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was
            partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks, iced teas,
            Joker Mad Energy™ drinks, smoothies in cans and Hansen’s® energy
            drinks. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales
            for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we
            announced a price increase to our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java
            Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1,
            2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter
            of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such 
            price increases.

Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 98.5 million cases for
            the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 25.7 million cases or 35.3% higher
            than case sales of 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006. The overall
            average net sales price per case increased to $9.19 for 2007 or 10.3% higher than the
            average net sales price per case of $8.33 for 2006. The increase in the average net
            sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales
            derived from higher priced products.


Net sales for the DSD segment were $809.8 million for year ended
            December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $295.5 million or 57.5% higher than net
            sales of $514.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales
            was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy®
            brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster
            Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® Assault

TM

energy drinks and Monster
            Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products
            such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks and
            Monster M-80

TM

energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset
            by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks and Joker Mad Energy™
            drinks. Changes in pricing within the DSD segment did not have a material impact on the
            increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth
            quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy® brand energy
            drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks,
            effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for
            the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in
            advance of such price increases.

Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.7 million for the year
            ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $3.2 million or 3.5% higher than
            net sales of $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net
            sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice
            blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in net
            sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of iced teas,
            smoothies in cans and Hansen’s® energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the
            Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the
            year ended December 31, 2007.

Gross Profit.**

* Gross profit was $468.0
            million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $151.4
            million or 47.8% higher than the gross profit of $316.6 million for the year ended
            December 31, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 51.7% for 2007 as
            compared to 52.3% for 2006. Increases in sales volumes contributed to the increase in
            gross profit dollars. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
            primarily due to an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of
            certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. To a lesser extent, the decrease
            in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to an increase in
            the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and
            packaging materials and certain juice concentrates and increased reserves for slow
            moving and obsolete inventory. Such decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net
            sales was partially offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher
            gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, a decrease in promotional and
            other allowances as a percentage of gross sales.

***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since
            some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of
            sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within
            another line item such as operating expenses.

Operating Expenses

. Total operating
            expenses were $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of
            approximately $79.0 million or 50.0% higher than total operating expenses of $158.0
            million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total operating expenses as a percentage
            of net sales was 26.2% for 2007, slightly higher than 26.1% for 2006. The increase in
            operating expenses in dollars was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight
            and warehouse costs of $8.7 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments,
            increased expenditures of $18.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased
            expenditures of $10.3 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of
            $4.9 million for sampling programs, increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million,
            increased expenditures of $8.6 million for professional services costs, including legal
            and accounting fees, and increased expenditures of $2.5 million relating to the costs
            associated with terminating existing distributors. Included in legal and accounting
            fees are costs of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) in
            connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting
            practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses,
            exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and
            2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing
            distributor and exlcusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of 2.5 million
            in


insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million for 2007 and 2006,
            respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and
            granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of
            net sales, were 23.4% for both 2007 and 2006.

Contribution Margin.

Contribution margin
            for the DSD segment was $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an
            increase of approximately $93.8 million or 49.9% higher than contribution margin of
            $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in contribution
            margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of
            Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such
            as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks and Monster
            M-80

TM

energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.9
            million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of approximately $2.2 million
            or 36.3% lower than contribution margin of $6.1 million for year ended December 31,
            2006. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily
            attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw
            materials and production.

Operating Income.

Operating income was
            $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $72.4
            million or 45.7% higher than operating income of $158.6 million for the year ended
            December 31, 2006. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.5% for
            2007 from 26.2% for 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an
            increase in gross profit of $151.4 million. The decrease in operating income as a
            percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased cost of sales as a
            percentage of net sales. Operating income, exclusive of recognition of deferred revenue
            of $1.9 million and $0.4 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the
            AB Distribution agreements entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors, exclusive
            of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively,
            attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors and
            exclusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance
            reimbursements) and $3.8 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with our
            special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation
            and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.2% for 2007 as compared
            to 28.9% for 2006.

Interest and Other Income, net

. Net
            interest and other income was $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an
            increase of $5.1 million from net interest and other income of $3.7 million for the
            year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net interest and other income was
            primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and
            short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior
            year.

Provision for Income Taxes

. Provision for
            income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $90.3 million, as compared to
            provision for income taxes of $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
            effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2007 was 37.7%, which was lower than
            the effective tax rate of 39.6% for 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate was
            primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that is exempt
            from federal income taxes and a reduction in federal taxes attributable to the domestic
            production tax deduction. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based
            compensation relating to incentive stock options that is not deducted for federal or
            state income tax purposes.

Net Income

. Net income was $149.4 million
            for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $51.5 million or 52.5% higher than
            net income of $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in
            gross profit of $151.4 million and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net interest and
            other income of approximately $5.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in
            operating expenses of $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of
            $26.1 million.


Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006
            Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005

Gross Sales.*

Gross sales were $696.3
            million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $280.9
            million or 67.6% higher than the $415.4 million gross sales for the year ended December
            31, 2005. The increase in gross sales for 2006 was primarily attributable to increased
            sales volumes of certain of our existing products, including the full year sales of
            Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks which were introduced in August
            2005. Promotional and other allowances were $90.5 million for 2006 an increase of $24.0
            million or 36.1% higher than promotional and other allowances of $66.5 million for
            2005. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased from
            16.0% in 2005 to 13.0% in 2006. As a result the percentage increase in gross sales in
            2006 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales.

*Gross sales – see definition above.

Net Sales

. Net sales were $605.8 million
            for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $256.9 million or
            73.6% higher than net sales of $348.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
            increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our
            Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks,
            lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® Assault

TM

energy
            drinks, as well as sales of Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks. To a
            lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume
            of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Lost® Energy™ drinks, sports drinks,
            Rumba™ brand energy juice,

Junior Juice®, Ace™
            energy drinks and Unbound Energy® energy drinks. The increase in net sales was
            partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen’s® energy
            drinks, smoothies in cans and Energade® energy sports drinks.

Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents were 72.7 million cases for
            the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 24.5 million cases or 50.9% higher
            than case sales of 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall
            average net sales price per case increased to $8.33 for 2006 or 15% higher than the net
            sales price per case of $7.24 for 2005. The increase in the average net sales prices
            per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from
            higher priced products.

Net sales for the DSD segment were $514.3 million for year ended
            December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $251.4 million or 95.6% higher than net
            sales of $262.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales
            was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy®
            brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster
            Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® Assault

TM

energy drinks, as well as
            sales of Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the
            increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of Lost®
            Energy™ drinks, Rumba

TM

brand energy juice, Ace

TM

energy
            drinks and Unbound Energy® energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially
            offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Energade® energy sports
            drinks.

Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.5 million for the year
            ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $5.5 million or 6.4% higher than
            net sales of $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net
            sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and
            juice cocktails, Junior Juice®

and sports drinks. The
            increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of
            Hansen’s® energy drinks and smoothies in cans.

Gross Profit.***

Gross profit was $316.6
            million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $134.1
            million or 73.4% higher than the gross profit of $182.5 million for the year ended
            December 31, 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for both 2006
            and 2005. Increases in sales volumes contributed to an increase in gross profit
            dollars. Gross profit as a


percentage of net sales was affected by an increase in the percentage of
            sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins.
            In addition, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also affected by a
            significant increase in certain freight-in costs due to the addition of new co-packers
            and warehouses and an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including sucrose,
            PET and aluminum cans and apple juice concentrate. These factors were offset by
            increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than
            those in the Warehouse segment.

***Gross Profit – see definition above.

Operating Expenses

. Total operating
            expenses were $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of
            approximately $78.9 million or 99.8% higher than total operating expenses of $79.1
            million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total operating expenses as a percentage
            of net sales increased to 26.1% for 2006 from 22.6% for 2005. The increase in total
            operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was
            primarily attributable to increased selling and distribution, and general and
            administrative expenses.

Selling and distribution expenses were $95.3 million for the year ended
            December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $44.5 million or 87.8% higher than
            selling and distribution expenses of $50.8 million for the year ended December 31,
            2005. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were
            15.7%, which was higher than selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net
            sales of 14.6% for 2005. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was
            partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $18.9
            million primarily due to increased volumes of shipments and increased freight rates and
            fuel prices, as well as increased expenditures of $6.9 million for merchandise displays
            primarily in anticipation of the changeover to select AB distributors, $4.3 million for
            sponsorships and endorsements, $4.3 million for trade development activities with
            distributors and customers, $2.7 million for commissions and
            royalties

,

and $1.8 million for
            sampling programs.

General and administrative expenses were $62.7 million for the year
            ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $34.4 million or 121.6% higher
            than general and administrative expenses of $28.3 million for the year ended December
            31, 2005. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006
            were 10.4%, which was higher than general and administrative expenses as a percentage
            of net sales of 8.1% for 2005. The increase in general and administrative expenses was
            primarily attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors
            of $12.7 million, stock compensation expense of $8.3 million as a result of our
            adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS”) No. 123 (revised
            2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) which was not
            expensed in the previous year including a cumulative adjustment of $1.3 million related
            to stock based compensation and related charges (See Part II, Item 8, Note 9,
            “Commitments and Contingencies – Other”), an increase in payroll
            expenses of $5.3 million, and an increase of $5.2 million in professional services
            costs, including legal and accounting fees. Included in legal and accounting fees are
            costs of $3.8 million relating to the Company’s special investigation of stock
            option grants.

Contribution Margin.

Contribution margin
            represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can
            be directly attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the DSD segment
            was $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately
            $78.9 million or 72.4% higher than contribution margin of $109.0 million for the year
            ended December 31, 2005. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was
            primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy
            drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.1 million for 2006, a
            decrease of approximately $4.3 million or 41.0% lower than contribution margin of $10.4
            million for 2005. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was
            primarily attributable to reduced sales of Hansen’s® energy drinks and a
            reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and
            production.

Operating Income.

Operating income was
            $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $55.2
            million or 53.4% higher than operating income of $103.4 million for


the
            year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in operating income was attributable to
            higher gross profit, which was offset by increased selling, distribution, general and
            administrative expenses. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to
            26.2% for 2006 from 29.6% for 2005. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of
            net sales was primarily attributable to increased general and administrative expenses
            as a percentage of net sales.

Interest and Other Income, net

. Net
            interest and other income was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an
            increase of $2.3 million from net interest income of $1.4 million for the year ended
            December 31, 2005. The increase in net interest and other income was primarily
            attributable to increased interest revenue earned on the Company’s invested cash
            balances which have increased significantly over the year.

Provision for Income Taxes

. Provision for
            income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $64.3 million as compared to
            provision for income taxes of $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
            effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2006 was 39.6%, which was lower than
            the effective tax rate of 40.1% for 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was
            primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that are exempt
            from federal income taxes and certain federal tax credits relating to export sales, and
            to a lesser extent, a decrease in state taxes due to the apportionment of sales to
            various states outside of California which have lower state tax rates. This decrease
            was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options
            for which we received no tax benefit.

Net Income

. Net income was $97.9 million
            for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $35.1 million or 56.0% higher than
            net income of $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The increase in net income was attributable to the increase in gross
            profit of approximately $134.1 million and the increase in net interest income of
            approximately $2.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in operating
            expenses of approximately $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes
            of approximately $22.3 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flows provided by operating activities
            –

Net cash provided by operating activities was $135.5
            million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $76.4 million in the
            comparable period in 2006. For 2007, cash provided by operating activities was
            primarily attributable to net income earned of $149.4 million and adjustments for
            certain non-cash expenses consisting of $10.2 million of share-based compensation and
            $2.1 million of depreciation and other amortization. In 2007, cash provided by
            operations also increased due to a $31.8 million increase in income taxes payable, a
            $22.4 million increase in accounts payable, a $19.1 million increase in deferred
            revenue and a $1.5 million increase in accrued compensation. In 2007, cash provided by
            operating activities was reduced due to a $29.5 million increase in tax benefit from
            exercise of stock options, a $26.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $21.1
            million increase in inventories, a $14.2 million increase in deferred income taxes, a
            $0.1 million decrease in accrued liabilities and a $3.2 million decrease in customer
            deposit liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased
            sales volumes as well as to increased sales to certain classes of customers who have
            longer payment terms. The increase in inventory is attributable to the addition of new
            copackers and warehouses, the introduction of new products and planned inventory levels
            to meet consumer demand.

Cash flows used in investing activities

–

Net cash used in investing
            activities was $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to
            $95.2 million used in investing activities in the comparable period in 2006. For 2007,
            cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and
            long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
            investments. Cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales
            and maturities of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments. For both
            periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets
            consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support our
            marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, computer and office
            furniture


and
            equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as wells as certain leasehold
            improvements. Management expects that it will continue to use a portion of its cash in
            excess of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short- and long-term
            investments and for other corporate purposes. Management, from time to time, considers
            the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment
            required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans and promotional
            vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new
            product lines and businesses compatible with the image of the Company’s
            brands.

At December 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash
            equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. We have
            historically invested these amounts in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities
            (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper
            and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are
            subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be
            exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of
            the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks
            associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our
            future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Our short-term investments include variable rate demand notes. Although
            the underlying maturities of these securities are long-term in nature, the investments
            are classified as short-term because they contain a ‘put’ feature which
            allows the holder to tender the securities at par on seven days notice. The
            ‘put’ feature is supported by a letter of credit or standby purchase
            agreement provided by a highly-rated commercial bank. The notes are issued by
            municipalities and other tax-exempt entities and the interest rate payable on these
            investments resets on a weekly basis. All of our short-term investments are held by
            major financial institutions.

Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities.
            These notes carry a AAA credit rating and certain of the notes are additionally backed
            by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. Liquidity for these
            auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows
            holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined
            intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. In February 2008, a large portion of the
            auctions for these auction rate securities failed. There is no assurance that auctions
            on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. The
            auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying
            demand. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the
            security generally requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that is above
            market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed
            will continue to accrue interest at the predetermined default rates and be auctioned
            every 7 to 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities,
            they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our
            ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate
            securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently these securities have been
            classified as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements. However,
            we anticipate that due to the higher interest rates now payable on certain of these
            securities and for other reasons, the issuers will take steps to refinance their notes
            to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the higher interest
            rates now payable on such securities.

If the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance
            their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit
            ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on
            these investments. We may be required to wait until market stability is restored for
            these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to
            40 years) to realize our investments’ recorded value. (See also “Part
            I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-

Our investments in marketable debt
            securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of
            these investments

”

and
            “Part I, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
            Risks”).


Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities
            –

Net cash provided by financing activities was $36.6
            million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to net cash used in financing
            activities of $7.7 million for the comparable period in 2006. For 2007, cash provided
            by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $29.5 million tax benefit in
            connection with the exercise of certain stock options and proceeds of $8.2 million
            received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain
            stock options.

Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other
            assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of
            accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal
            recurring use of cash.

Debt and other obligations

–

HBC has entered into a credit
            facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of
            credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the
            credit facility, HBC increased its available borrowings under the revolving line of
            credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is
            effective through June 1, 2008. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is
            based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying LIBOR rates up
            to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain
            financial ratios maintained by HBC. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of
            credit at December 31, 2007. Letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company totaling
            $0.3 million under this credit facility were outstanding as of December 31,
            2007.

The terms of the Company’s line of credit contain certain
            financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance
            with its covenants at December 31, 2007.

If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or
            involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit
            immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including
            instituting legal proceedings.

Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations related to
            sponsorships and other commitments. (See also “Part II, Item 8 - Note 9,
            Commitments & Contingencies”).

Purchase commitments include obligations made by the Company and its
            subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and
            packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms.

The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual
            obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2007:

In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement
            between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”), dated as of
            January 1, 2006, the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce
            resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from January 1,
            2006 through December 31, 2009. Should the Company fail to purchase the minimum volume,
            the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain


capital reimbursements on a pro-rated basis. The Company’s maximum
            liability under this agreement is $6.0 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with a
            number of conditions under this agreement.

Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash
            resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital
            needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in
            accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and
            development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of
            capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on the
            Company’s current plans, at this time the Company estimates that capital
            expenditures are likely to be less than $10.0 million through December 2008. However,
            future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.

In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased
            offices in Corona, California. In October 2006, we also entered into a lease agreement
            pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space
            located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental
            payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly
            rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the
            lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and
            distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located
            in Corona, California.

In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of
            vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. The property is located adjacent to
            the newly leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of
            constructing a new office building on such land, which will replace our existing office
            space.

We have sublet in excess of 50% of our previous office, warehouse and
            distribution space for the remainder of that lease term which expires in October
            2010.

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in
            accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that
            affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various
            allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of
            long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of
            litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The
            following summarizes the most significant accounting and reporting policies and
            practices of the Company:

Accounts Receivable

– The Company
            evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of
            factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific
            customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific
            reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized
            receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected.
            In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt
            charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent past loss history and an
            overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

Inventories

– Inventories are stated
            at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current
            estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews its inventory
            quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based
            primarily on the Company's estimated forecast of product demand, production
            availability and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for the
            Company's products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for
            the Company's products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general
            market conditions or other factors that may result in


cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders
            placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally,
            management's estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result
            in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete
            inventory.

Long-Lived Assets

–Management
            regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain
            identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more
            frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
            asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and
            equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of
            future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from
            the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than
            the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the
            asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of
            the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s
            estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31,
            2007.

Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment
            of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a “critical accounting
            estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period
            to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows
            and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the
            assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be
            material. Management’s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require
            significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past
            and are expected to continue to do so.

Intangibles

– Intangibles are
            comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive
            ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale
            and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy®
            trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and
            beverages. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the
            United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also
            owns the Blue Sky® trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior
            Juice® trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142,
            “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. Under the provisions on SFAS No.
            142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while
            continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for
            impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an
            indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization,
            management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An
            impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if
            it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income
            approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently
            subjective and is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning
            expected future conditions. Based on management’s impairment analysis performed
            for the year ended December 31, 2007, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded
            the carrying value.

In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets
            are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing
            product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their
            impact on our future cash flows.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

– The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiary are
            translated in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”.
            The Company has determined that the functional currency of its subsidiary should be its
            local


currency. The accounts of this foreign subsidiary have been translated
            into United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date
            for assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues
            and expenses. Cumulative translation gains or losses are recorded as accumulated other
            comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction
            gains and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they
            occur. Gains and losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 were
            insignificant.

Revenue Recognition

– The Company
            recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
            occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably
            assured. Generally, ownership of and title to the Company’s products passes to
            customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of the Company’s
            distributors may also perform a separate function as a copacker on the Company’s
            behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company’s products that are
            copacked on the Company’s behalf by those copackers who are also distributors,
            passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them that they have taken
            transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods.
            Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in
            accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-09,
            “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a
            Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)”.

Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash
            discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical
            experience.

Cost of Sales

– Cost of sales
            consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products,
            co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal
            transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the
            Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials
            account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans,
            bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials.

Operating Expenses

– Operating
            expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products
            to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for
            advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for
            merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses,
            other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll
            costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination
            payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, entertainment,
            insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs.

Stock-Based Compensation

– Beginning
            in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in
            accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and
            recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and
            directors based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton
            option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of
            grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in
            estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are
            fully transferable. The Company’s employee stock options, however, have
            characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example,
            employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally
            not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
            subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected
            life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in
            subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an
            option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily
            represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. The Company uses
            historical data to estimate the expected price


volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate.
            The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
            grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with
            the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions,
            the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax
            expense, which could be material to its results of operations.

Income Taxes

– Current income tax
            expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A
            deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future
            consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of
            assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing,
            prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax
            assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets
            will not be realized, the Company will reduce the value of these assets to their
            expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these
            assets is necessarily based on the Company's judgment. If the Company subsequently
            determines that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized
            in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby
            increasing net income in the period when that determination was made.

Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
            (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
            Measurements”

,

which defines
            fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
            about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal
            years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
            The FASB has deferred the implementation of SFAS No. 157 by one year for certain
            non-financial assets and liabilities such that this will be effective for the fiscal
            year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of
            adopting SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
            Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB
            Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to choose to
            measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The
            provisions of SFAS No.159 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year.
            The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 on its
            consolidated financial statements.

Sales

The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding
            sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily
            indicative of annual results or continuing trends.

Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit
            case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished
            beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid
            ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases
            (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company.
            Sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are
            expressed in actual cases.

The Company’s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal
            trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the
            year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first
            and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for
            Hansen’s products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the
            effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however,
            such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansen’s products
            expands outside of California. The Company’s experience with its energy drink
            products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the
            percentage of the Company’s sales that are represented by such products continues
            to increase,


seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations
            may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the
            opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition
            of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished
            products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses. (See
            also “Part I, Item 1. – Business – Seasonality”).

Inflation

The Company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on
            the Company’s results of operations for the periods presented.

Forward Looking Statements

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
            “Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on
            behalf of the Company. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward
            looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933, as
            amended, and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding
            the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of
            funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All
            statements which address operating performance, events or developments that management
            expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including statements related to
            new products, volume growth, revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from
            operations, and/or the Company’s existing credit facility, earnings per share
            growth, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results and non
            historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act.
            Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “thinks,”
            “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” and similar
            expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

Management cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms
            and/or important factors, many of which are outside our control, involve a number of
            risks, uncertainties and other factors, that could cause actual results and events to

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from

            Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A. – Risk Factors,”
            for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and
            uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not
            necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or
            developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking
            statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results.
            Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results
            described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent
            uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than
            anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking
            statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as
            of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to
            forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them,
            after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or
            expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by
            applicable securities laws.

ITEM
            7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
            RISKS

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely
            subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss
            arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which the Company is
            exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices, commodity prices affecting the
            costs of juice concentrates and other raw materials (including, but not limited to,
            increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as
            cane sugar, glucose, sucrose, milk and cream, and high fructose corn syrup, which are
            used in many of the Company’s products), changes in interest rates on the
            Company’s long-term debt and limited availability of certain raw materials such
            as sucralose. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of
            commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is
            limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. In addition, we are subject
            to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate, including
            the collectability of accounts receivable.

We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from
            fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity
            prices. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks
            associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, including, but not
            limited to, cans, PET plastic bottles, glass, labels, sucrose, high fructose corn
            syrup, glucose, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners or packaging
            arrangements, or protecting against shortages of such ingredients or raw
            materials.

We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest
            rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short term
            investments. Certain of our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk
            because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the
            market values of these investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest
            rates.


At December 31, 2007, we had $12.4 million in cash and cash
            equivalents and $290.2 million in short- and long-term investments. We have
            historically invested these amounts in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities
            or notes (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds,
            commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these
            investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks,
            which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various
            sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market
            risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on
            our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (See also
            “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors –

Our investments
            in marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect
            the liquidity of these investments”

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

–Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's
            management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have
            evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
            procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of
            the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief
            Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's
            disclosure controls and procedures are adequate and effective to ensure that
            information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the
            Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
            periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the
            Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
            officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
            disclosures.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

– There were no changes in internal control over financial
            reporting that occurred during the fiscal period covered by this report that have
            materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
            internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
            Reporting

– Our management is responsible for
            establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
            defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with
            the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
            Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
            internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the
            framework in

Internal Control – Integrated
            Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
            of the Treadway Commission. Based on our management’s evaluation under the
            framework in

Internal Control - Integrated
            Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control
            over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
            has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
            accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
            FIRM

To the
            Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hansen
            Natural Corporation

Corona,
            California

We
            have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Hansen Natural
            Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007,
            based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
            Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
            Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible
            for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
            assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
            in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
            Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal
            control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
            conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
            audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
            financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
            obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
            risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
            effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
            procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
            provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
            company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
            under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
            financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
            company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
            reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
            preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
            reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
            maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
            transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
            assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
            financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
            that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
            authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
            reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
            acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
            material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
            reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
            controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected
            on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
            internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk
            that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
            degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
            our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria
            established in

Internal Control – Integrated
            Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
            of the Treadway Commission.

We
            have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial
            statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 of the Company
            and our report dated February  29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
            financial statements and financial statement schedule.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT
            SCHEDULE


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
            FIRM

To the
            Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hansen
            Natural Corporation

Corona,
            California

We
            have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hansen Natural Corporation
            and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
            related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
            each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007.  Our audits also
            included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a).  These
            consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
            responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
            opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based
            on our audits.

We
            conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform
            the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
            statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
            test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
            financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
            used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
            consolidated financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
            a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
            our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
            respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and
            the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
            period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally
            accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial
            statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
            statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
            set forth therein.

As
            discussed in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
            changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation during the year ended
            December 31, 2006 as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
            No. 123R, “Share-based Payment” in 2006.

We
            have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial
            reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
            Commission and our report dated February 29, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion on
            the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
                            POLICIES

            9, 2007. HBC conducts the vast majority of the Company’s operating business and
            generates substantially all of the Company’s operating revenues. References
            herein to “Hansen” or the “Company” when used to describe the
            operating business of the Company are references to the business of HBC unless

In addition, HBC, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Blue Sky
            Natural Beverage Co. (“Blue Sky”) and Hansen Junior Juice Company
            (“Junior Juice”) owns and operates the natural soda business under the Blue
            Sky® trademark and the Junior Juice beverage business under the Junior Juice®
            trademarks, respectively.

Basis of Presentation

– The

            (“GAAP”).

Principles of Consolidation

– The
            accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
            its wholly owned subsidiaries, HBC, MLDA, Monster UK, Blue Sky and Junior Juice since

            have been eliminated in consolidation.

Stock Split

and Amendment of Articles of
            Incorporation

– On August 8, 2005, the Board of
            Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of the Company’s common stock which
            was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. On June 1, 2006, the Company, after
            stockholder approval, increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to
            120,000,000 shares. On June 7, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-one
            stock split of the Company’s common stock which was effected in the form of a
            300% stock dividend. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
            effects of the stock splits and the resulting increase in the number of authorized
            shares of common stock. All share and per-share amounts have been recast to reflect the
            individual stock splits.


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share
                            Amounts)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

–The
            Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
            months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the
            Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally
            insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits
            and does not expect to incur any losses in the future.

Investments

– Those investments that
            have original maturities greater than three months but less than twelve months are
            included in short-term investments. The Company classifies debt securities in one of
            two categories: held-to-maturity or available-for-sale in accordance with Statement of
            Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for
            Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”).
            Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive
            intent and ability to hold until maturity. All other securities not included in the
            held-to-maturity category are classified as available-for-sale. No securities are held
            for speculative or trading purposes. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at
            amortized cost which approximates fair market value. A decline in the market value of
            any held-to-maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary, results
            in a reduction in its carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to
            earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and discounts
            are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held-to-maturity security as an
            adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method. The Company evaluates whether
            the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than temporary at each
            quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market
            pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic
            trends in the industry and information on the investee company’s financial
            condition. Realized and unrealized gains and losses were not material in the years
            ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Accounts Receivable –

The Company
            evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of
            factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific
            customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific
            reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized
            receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected.
            In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt
            charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent past loss history and an
            overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

Inventories

– Inventories are valued
            at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market value (net realizable
            value).

Property and Equipment

– Property and
            equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture, office equipment, equipment
            and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is
            calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
            based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases
            and is calculated using the straight-line method.

Intangibles

– Intangibles are
            comprised of trademarks representing the Company’s exclusive ownership of the
            Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution
            of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy® trademark in
            connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages.
            The Company also owns a number of other trademarks in the United States as well as in a
            number of countries around the world. In addition, the Company owns the Blue Sky®
            trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice® trademark,
            which was acquired in May 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and
            Other Intangible Assets,” intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
            amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events
            indicate that an impairment exits. The

                            Amounts)

Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its
            indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds
            the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its
            trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives which range from
            1 to 25 years.

Long-Lived Assets

– Management
            regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain
            intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently
            if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not
            be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an
            estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to
            result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are
            less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write
            down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the
            present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
            management's estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future
            cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management's best estimate of
            assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the fiscal years ended December
            31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, there were no impairment losses recorded.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

– The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiary are
            translated in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”.
            The Company has determined that the functional currency of its subsidiary should be its
            local currency. The accounts of this foreign subsidiary have been translated into
            United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for
            assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate for the period for revenues and
            expenses. Cumulative translation gains or losses are recorded as accumulated other
            comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction
            gains and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they
            occur. Gains and losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 were not
            significant.

Revenue Recognition

– The Company
            recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
            occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably
            assured. Generally, ownership of and title to the Company’s products passes to
            customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of the Company’s
            distributors may also perform a separate function as a copacker on the Company’s
            behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company’s products that are
            copacked on the Company’s behalf by those copackers who are also distributors,
            passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them that they have taken
            transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods.
            Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in
            accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-9,
            “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a
            Reseller of the Vendor’s
            Products)”

.

Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash
            discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical
            experience.

Cost of Sales

– Cost of sales
            consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products,
            co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal
            transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the
            Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials
            account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans,
            bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials.

Operating Expenses

– Operating
            expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products
            to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses
            for


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share
                            Amounts)

advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for
            merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses,
            other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such
            costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees,
            termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors,
            depreciation and other general and administrative costs.

Freight Costs

– For the years ended
            December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, freight-out costs amounted to $40.8 million, $36.2
            million and $19.1 million, respectively, and have been recorded in operating expenses
            in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Advertising Expenses

– The Company
            accounts for advertising production costs by expensing such production costs the first
            time the related advertising takes place. Advertising expenses, including but not
            limited to production costs, amounted to $66.6 million, $35.7 and $18.0 million for the
            years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Advertising expenses are
            included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
            income.

Income Taxes

– The Company accounts
            for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
            Taxes”. This statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
            liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the
            Company’s financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of the deferred items
            is based on enacted tax laws. In the event the future consequences of differences
            between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the Company’s assets and
            liabilities result in a deferred tax asset, SFAS No. 109 requires an evaluation of the
            probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset. A
            valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely
            than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be
            realized.

Stock-Based Compensation

– Prior to
            January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation plans in
            accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
            “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”(“APB No. 25”), and
            related interpretations, the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
            “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Related to Options Issued to
            Employees”, and SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
            – Transition and Disclosure – an amendment of FASB Statement No.
            123”

.

Under APB No. 25, the
            Company recognized stock-based compensation associated with stock options and awards
            under the intrinsic value method, whereby stock-based compensation was determined as
            the difference, if any, between the fair value of the related common stock on the
            measurement date and the price an employee had to pay to exercise the award.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised
            2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) using the
            modified-prospective application method and therefore has not restated prior period
            results (See Note 11, “Stock-Based Compensation”). This Statement replaces
            SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and supersedes APB
            No. 25. SFAS No. 123R requires the fair value of all stock option awards issued to
            employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period. The Statement
            also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any
            unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption. Generally, the
            Company recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a
            straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the reward, which is typically
            the vesting term of five years. The Company estimated the forfeiture rate for fiscal
            2007 based on historical experience with actual forfeitures during the preceding three
            fiscal years.

Net Income Per Common Share

– In accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per
            Share”, net

income per common share, on a basic and diluted basis, is
            presented for all periods. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net
            income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
            Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
            number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of
            common equivalent shares assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed
            treasury share repurchases at average market prices, as applicable.

Concentration of Risk –

Certain of
            the Company’s products utilize components (raw materials and/or co-packing
            services) from a limited number of sources. A disruption in the supply of such
            components could significantly affect the Company’s revenues from those products,
            as alternative sources of such components may not be available at commercially
            reasonable rates or within a reasonably short time period. The Company continues to
            take steps on an ongoing basis to secure the availability of alternative sources for
            such components and minimize the risk of any disruption in production.

Two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 12%, and 19% and 12%
            of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
            respectively. One customer accounted for approximately 18% of the Company’s net
            sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. A decision by either customer, or any other
            large customer, to decrease the amount purchased from the Company or to cease carrying
            the Company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the
            Company’s financial condition and consolidated results of operations.

Credit Risk

– The Company sells its
            products nationally, primarily to retailers and beverage distributors. The Company
            performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
            collateral. The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, and
            historically, such losses have been within management’s expectations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

–
            At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying values of cash, investments, accounts
            receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of
            these financial instruments. Long-term debt bears interest at a rate comparable to the
            prime rate; therefore, management believes the carrying amount for the outstanding
            borrowings at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, approximates fair
            value.

Use of Estimates

– The preparation of
            the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to
            make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
            liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
            financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
            reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

– In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
            (“FASB”), issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
            Measurements”

,

which defines
            fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
            about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal
            years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
            The FASB has deferred the implementation of SFAS No. 157 by one year for certain
            non-financial assets and liabilities such that this will be effective for the fiscal
            year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of
            adopting SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements.


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share
                            Amounts)

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
            Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB
            Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to choose to
            measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The
            provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year.
            The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 on its
            consolidated financial statements.

INVESTMENTS

The following table summarizes the Company’s investments at
            December 31, 2007 and 2006:

The Company’s short-term investments as of December 31, 2007 were
            comprised of variable rate demand notes. Although the underlying maturities of these
            securities are long-term in nature, the investments are classified as short-term
            because they contain a ‘put’ feature which allows the holder to tender the
            securities at par on seven days notice. The ‘put’ feature is supported by a
            letter of credit or standby purchase agreement provided by a highly-rated commercial
            bank. The notes are issued by municipalities and other tax-exempt entities and the
            interest rate payable on these investments resets on a weekly basis. All of the
            Company’s short-term investments are held by major financial
            institutions.

The Company’s long-term investments as of December 31, 2007 are
            comprised of municipal or educational related or other public body notes with an
            auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”). These notes carry a AAA
            credit rating and certain of the notes are additionally backed by various federal
            agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. Liquidity for these auction rate
            securities


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share
                            Amounts)

is
            typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and
            resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to
            35 days. In February 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate
            securities failed. There is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate
            securities in the Company’s investment portfolio will succeed. The auction
            failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand. In
            the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security
            generally requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that is generally above
            market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed
            will continue to accrue interest at the predetermined rates and be auctioned every 7 to
            35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature
            or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, the
            Company’s ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of its
            auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, these securities
            are classified as long term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance
            sheet.

If the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance
            their debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit
            ratings deteriorate, the Company may in the future be required to record an impairment
            charge on these investments. The Company may be required to wait until market stability
            is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes
            (up to 40 years) to realize its investments’ recorded value.

INTANGIBLES

The following provides additional information concerning the Company's
            intangibles as of December 31:

All amortizing trademarks have been assigned an estimated finite useful
            life and such trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over the number of
            years that approximate their respective useful lives ranging from one to 25 years
            (weighted-average life of 19 years). Total amortization expense recorded was $0.06
            million, $0.06 million and $0.07 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
            and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, future estimated amortization expense
            related to amortizing trademarks through the year ended December 31, 2012 is
            approximately $0.06 million per year.

6.

LONG-TERM DEBT

HBC has a credit facility from Comerica Bank (“Comerica”)
            consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance
            with the amended provisions of the credit facility, HBC increased its available
            borrowing under the revolving line of credit from $7.5 million collateralized to $10.0
            million non-collateralized. The revolving line of credit expires on June 1, 2008.
            Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base
            (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying LIBOR rates up to 180 days, plus an
            additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios
            maintained by HBC. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at
            December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The terms of the Company’s line of credit contain certain
            financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance
            with these covenants at December 31, 2007.

If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or
            involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit
            immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including
            instituting legal proceedings.

Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31:



Capital leases, collateralized by vehicles and warehouse
                            equipment, payable over 26 to 60 months in monthly installments at
                            various effective interest rates ranging from 4.3% to 9.9%, with final
                            payments ending from 2007 to 2008.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating Leases

– In October 2006,
            the Company entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which it leased 346,495 square
            feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease
            commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months commencing March 2007,
            excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement
            of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month
            period. The new warehouse and distribution space replaced the Company’s previous
            warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California.

In October 2006, the Company also entered into an agreement to acquire
            1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. The property is located
            adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution space. The Company is reviewing
            the feasibility of constructing a new office building on such land, which will replace
            the Company’s existing office space. In the interim, the Company relocated its
            corporate offices in September 2007 to newly leased offices located in Corona,
            California.

The Company has sublet in excess of 50% of its previous office,
            warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of that lease term which expires in
            October 2010.

We also rent additional warehouse space on a short-term basis from time
            to time in public warehouses located throughout the United States and
            Canada.

Rent expense was $3.3 million, $1.3 million and $1.1 million for the
            years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments at December 31, 2007 under the operating
            leases referred to above are as follows:

Purchase Commitments

–

The Company has purchase commitments aggregating approximately $7.4
            million, which represent commitments made by the Company and its subsidiaries to
            various suppliers of raw materials for the manufacturing and packaging of its products.
            These obligations vary in terms.

In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement
            between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”) dated as of
            January 1, 2006, as amended, the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of
            24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four year period commencing from
            January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Should the Company fail to purchase the
            minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital
            reimbursements on a pro-rated basis. The Company’s maximum liability under this
            agreement is $6.0 million subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions
            under this agreement.

The Company purchases various raw material items, including, but not
            limited to, flavors, ingredients, containers, milk and cream from a limited number of
            resources. An interruption in supply from any of such resources could result in the
            Company’s inability to produce certain products for limited or possibly extended
            periods of time. The aggregate value of purchases from suppliers of such limited
            resources described above for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $107.1
            million.

Noncancelable contractual obligations

– The Company has noncancelable contractual obligations
            aggregating approximately $45.3 million related primarily to sponsorships and other
            commitments, payable over four years.

Licensing Agreements

– The Company
            produces, sells and distributes Lost® Energy™ drinks under an exclusive
            license with Lost International LLC. The license agreement requires certain royalty
            payments to be made related to the sale of Lost® brand products. Royalty expense
            under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $0.5
            million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively.

Litigation

– In August 2006, HBC
            filed a lawsuit against National Beverage Company, Shasta Beverages, Inc., Newbevco
            Inc. and Freek’N Beverage Corp. (collectively “National”) seeking an
            injunction and damages for trademark infringement, trademark dilution, unfair
            competition and deceptive trade practices based on National’s unauthorized use of
            HBC’s valuable and distinctive Monster

Energy® trade dress in connection with a line of energy drinks it
            launched under the “Freek” brand name. In June 2007, the parties entered
            into a confidential settlement agreement resolving the parties’ disputes in the
            litigation. National subsequently repudiated the settlement agreement and HBC responded
            by filing a motion in the United States District Court for the Central District of
            California to enforce the terms of the confidential settlement agreement. On August 14,
            2007, the United States District Court entered an Order enforcing the settlement
            agreement and permanently enjoining National from manufacturing, distributing,
            shipping, marketing, selling and offering to sell “Freek” energy drinks in
            containers using the original “Freek” trade dress that was subject to the
            District Court’s preliminary injunction. National filed a notice of appeal with
            the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States. National requested the
            District Court to stay this Order pending its appeal to the Court of Appeals for the
            Ninth Circuit, which was subsequently denied by the District Court. The Ninth Circuit
            Court of Appeals has not yet docketed National’s appeal.

In August 2006, HBC filed an action in the Federal Courts of Australia,
            Victoria District Registry against Bickfords Australia (Pty) Limited and Meak (Pty)
            Ltd. (collectively “Bickfords”), in which HBC is seeking an injunction
            restraining Bickfords from selling or offering for sale or promoting for sale in
            Australia any energy drink or beverage under the Monster Energy or Monster marks or any
            similar marks and for damages and costs. The defendants cross-claimed seeking an order
            to restrain HBC from selling, or offering for sale, or promoting in Australia any drink
            product under the Monster Energy® or Monster® trademarks or any similar
            trademarks and for costs. The trial took place in February 2007 and closing oral
            submissions took place in June 2007. The Judge has not rendered his decision in the
            case to date.

In September 2006, Christopher Chavez purporting to act on behalf of
            himself and a class of consumers yet to be defined filed an action in the United States
            District Court, Northern District of California, against the Company and its
            subsidiaries for unfair business practices, false advertising, violation of California
            Consumers Legal Remedies Act, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation alleging that the
            Company misleadingly labels its Blue Sky beverages as originating in and/or being
            canned under the authority of a company located in Santa Fe, New Mexico. On June 11,
            2007, the United States District Court, Northern District of California granted the
            Company’s motion to dismiss Chavez’s complaint with prejudice. In late
            June, Mr. Chavez noticed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth
            Circuit. Mr. Chavez, as the appellant, has filed his opening brief and Hansen’s
            response has also been filed. The appeal has not been scheduled for hearing.

During 2007, Gate City Beverage Company (“Gate City”),
            notified the Company of its intention to sell its business and requested the Company
            consent to the assignment of the distribution agreement with the Company.  The
            Company declined its consent and exercised its contractual right to terminate the Gate
            City distribution agreement in accordance with its terms.  Gate City has disputed
            the Company’s right to refuse consent and to terminate the agreement and on
            February 6, 2008, filed arbitration proceedings to be held in Orange County, California
            against the Company for damages. The Company disputes liability and is defending the
            claim.

The Company is subject to litigation from time to time in the normal
            course of business, including claims from terminated distributors. Although it is not
            possible to predict the outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to the
            Company and after consultation with counsel, management believes that such litigation
            in the aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
            financial position or results of operations.

Derivative Litigation

- From November 2006
            through January 2007, purported derivative lawsuits relating to the Company’s
            past stock option grants were filed by parties identifying themselves as shareholders
            of Hansen. These lawsuits name as defendants certain of Hansen’s current and
            former employees, officers and directors, and name Hansen as a nominal defendant. Three
            of these cases, Chandler v. Sacks, et al. (No. RIC460186), Plotkin v. Sacks, et al.
            (No. RIC460485), and Alama v. Sacks, et al. (No. RIC463968), were filed in the Superior
            Court of California, County of Riverside. Two additional shareholder derivative
            lawsuits, Linan v. Sacks, et al. (No. ED CV 06-01393) and Cribbs v. Blower et al. (No.
            ED CV 07-00037), were filed in the United States District Court for the Central
            District of California. On March 26, 2007, the Cribbs and Linan actions were
            consolidated for all purposes before the District Court, which appointed lead and local
            counsel and restyled the action as In re Hansen Natural Corporation Derivative
            Litigation (No. ED CV 07-37 JFW (PLAx)) (the “Federal Derivative Action”).
            On April 23, 2007, the Federal Derivative Action plaintiffs filed an amended
            consolidated complaint. On April 16, 2007, the Alama v. Sacks, et al. lawsuit filed in
            California Superior Court was voluntarily dismissed. On May 23, 2007, Alama filed a
            substantially similar complaint in the Chancery Court of Delaware, New Castle County
            (No. 2978) (the “Delaware Derivative Action”). Pursuant to a stipulation
            among the parties that was so ordered by the Court on May 25, 2007, the Chandler and
            Plotkin actions filed in the Superior Court of California were consolidated (the
            “California Derivative Action”) and were stayed for all purposes until
            February 29, 2008.

Plaintiffs in each of the Federal Derivative Action, the Delaware
            Derivative Action and the California Derivative Action, who purport to bring suit on
            behalf of the Company, have made no demand on the Board of Directors and allege that
            such demand is excused. The complaints in the derivative actions generally allege,
            among other things, that by improperly dating certain Hansen stock option grants,
            defendants breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, unjustly enriched
            themselves and violated federal and California statutes. Plaintiffs seek, among other
            things, unspecified damages to be paid to Hansen, corporate governance reforms, an
            accounting, rescission, restitution and the creation of a constructive
            trust.

In the Summer of 2007, the Company and the individual defendants moved
            to dismiss the Federal Derivative Action and the Delaware Derivative Action.
            Thereafter, the parties to the Federal Derivative Action and the Delaware Derivative
            Action engaged in settlement negotiations, and have now entered into a Stipulation and
            Agreement of Settlement dated February 25, 2008 (the “Stipulation”)
            providing for the settlement and dismissal of the Federal Derivative Action and the
            Delaware Derivative Action (the “Settlement”). The Stipulation was filed
            with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on February 25,
            2008. The Settlement is subject to the U.S. District Court’s approval following a
            hearing at which shareholders will have the opportunity to object. The District Court
            will then decide whether to approve the Settlement as fair, adequate and in the best
            interest of Hansen’s shareholders. On February 28, 2008, the District Court
            preliminarily approved the Settlement and scheduled the settlement hearing for May 5,
            2008. There can be no guarantee that the Settlement will be finalized and receive the
            required approval from the District Court.

As part of the Settlement, the Company has agreed to maintain certain
            previously adopted changes relating to its stock option granting procedures, and to
            adopt certain other changes in its procedures and corporate governance practices (the
            “Corporate Reforms”). Hansen has agreed to keep these Corporate Reforms in
            place for a period of at least two years, subject to certain conditions. The Settlement
            further provides for plaintiffs’ counsel to apply to the Court for an award of
            attorneys’ fees in the amount of $0.4 million. The Company has agreed not to
            object to this application. All attorneys’ fees will be paid exclusively by the
            Company’s insurance carrier. Aside from attorneys’ fees, the Settlement
            contemplates no payments by or to the Company or by the individual
            defendants.

Under the Settlement, plaintiffs will give a full release on behalf of
            the Company and its shareholders covering all claims that were or could have been
            brought in the Federal and Delaware Derivative Actions as well as all claims that arise
            out of or are based upon or relate to the allegations, transactions or facts involved
            in the complaints filed in those actions. The defendants make no admission of
            wrongdoing under the Settlement and expressly deny each and every claim and allegation
            made against them in the derivative actions, including, but not limited to, any
            allegation of manipulation or illegal backdating of stock options.

Securities Litigation

- From November 2006
            through December 2006, several plaintiffs filed shareholder class actions in the United
            States District Court for the Central District of California against Hansen and certain
            of its employees, officers and directors, entitled Hutton v. Hansen Natural Corp., et
            al. (No. 06-07599), Kingery v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-07771), Williams v.
            Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-01369), Ziolkowski v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al.
            (No. ED 06-01403), Walker v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-08229) (the
            “Class Actions”). On February 27, 2007, the Class Actions were consolidated
            by the District Court and styled as In re Hansen Natural Corporation Securities
            Litigation (CV06-07599 JFW (PLAx)). The Court appointed Jason E. Peltier as lead
            plaintiff (“Lead Plaintiff”) and approved lead counsel. Lead Plaintiff
            filed a consolidated class action complaint on April 30, 2007.

The consolidated class action complaint superseded all previously filed
            class action complaints and became the operative complaint to which the Company had to
            respond. Lead Plaintiff alleged, on behalf of all persons who purchased Hansen common
            stock during the period beginning November 12, 2001 through November 9, 2006 (the
            “Class Period”), that Hansen and the individual defendants (collectively,
            the “Defendants”) made misleading statements and omissions of material fact
            which artificially inflated the market price of Hansen common stock throughout the
            Class Period. Plaintiffs further allege that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and
            20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
            Act”), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by misrepresenting or failing to
            disclose that defendants incorrectly dated stock option grants, that the
            Company’s internal controls were inadequate, and that, as a result, defendants
            engaged in improper accounting practices. Plaintiff sought an unspecified amount of
            damages.

On June 25, 2007, the Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated class
            action complaint. On October 16, 2007, the District Court granted the Defendants’
            motions to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint with prejudice and without
            leave to amend. The Court then entered final judgment in favor of the Defendants, and
            the time within which to appeal the judgment has expired.

Guarantees

– The Company from time to
            time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to
            indemnify parties against third party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i)
            certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and employees under
            which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out
            of their employment relationship, (ii) certain distribution or purchase agreements
            under which the Company may have to indemnify the Company’s customers from any
            claim, liability or loss arising out of any actual or alleged injury or damages
            suffered in connection with the consumption or purchase of the Company’s
            products, and (iii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required
            to indemnify property owners for liabilities and other claims arising from the
            Company’s use of the applicable premises. The terms of such obligations vary and
            typically, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Generally, the Company
            believes that its insurance coverage is adequate to cover any liabilities or claims
            arising out of such instances. Consequently, the Company does not believe the fair
            value of these guarantees is material to the Company’s consolidated financial
            statements.

Other Matters

– Commencing in fiscal
            2006, a special committee (the “Special Committee”) of the Board of
            Directors of the Company, assisted by independent legal counsel and accounting advisors
            retained by the Special Committee, conducted an independent investigation of the
            Company’s stock option grants and stock option granting practices during the
            period January 1, 2001 through November 13, 2006, which resulted in a pre-tax
            compensation charge of approximately $1.3 million related to certain unintentional
            accounting errors. Such charge was recorded in operating expenses for the year ended
            December 31, 2006. The Company has elected to compensate employees with outstanding
            stock options that were affected by such errors for all additional taxes, interest and
            penalties payable by them pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, a charge
            of approximately $2.8 million has been recorded in operating expenses and accrued
            liabilities at December 31, 2007.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB
            Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN
            No. 48”). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
            recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No.
            109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
            financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to
            be taken in a tax return. This pronouncement also provides guidance on derecognition,
            classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
            transition.

Upon adoption of FIN No. 48 as of January 1, 2007, the Company’s
            reassessment of its tax positions did not have a material impact on the consolidated
            financial statements. The following is a rollforward of the Company’s total gross
            unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 (in
            thousands):

The gross unrealized tax benefits, if recognized, would result in a
            reduction of the Company’s provision and effective tax rate. With the adoption of
            FIN No. 48, the Company has decided to classify interest and penalties as a component
            of tax expense. No interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits were accrued as
            of December 31, 2007. The Company believes that the total amount of unrecognized tax
            benefit at December 31, 2007 will be resolved within the next 12 months.

On August 9, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service began its examination of
            the Company’s U.S. federal income tax return for the period ended December 31,
            2005. The examination is expected to be completed by October 2008.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
            No. 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for
            all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair
            values. SFAS No. 123R supersedes the Company’s previous accounting methodology
            using the intrinsic value method under APB 25.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective
            application method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized
            during the year ended December 31, 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all
            share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based
            on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
            SFAS No. 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes and (b) compensation expense for all
            share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the grant date
            fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. In accordance
            with the modified prospective application method, the Company’s consolidated
            financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of
            adopting SFAS No. 123R.

On November 10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS
            123R-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax
            Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

. The Company has
            elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this FASB Staff Position
            for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R. The
            alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning
            balance of the additional paid-in capital pool (“APIC Pool”) related to the
            tax effects of employee share-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent
            impact on the APIC Pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of
            employee and director share-based awards that were outstanding upon the adoption of
            SFAS 123R.

The Company has two stock option plans under which shares were available
            for grant at December 31, 2007: the Hansen Natural Corporation Amended and Restated
            2001 Stock Option Plan (the “2001 Option Plan”) and the 2005 Hansen Natural
            Corporation Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2005 Directors
            Plan”).

The 2001 Option Plan permits the granting of options to purchase up to
            22,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company to certain key employees or
            non-employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options granted under the 2001
            Option Plan may be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
            Code, as amended, non-qualified stock options or stock appreciation rights. Stock
            options are exercisable at such time and in such amounts as determined by the
            Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company up to a ten-year period
            after their date of grant. As of December 31, 2007, options to purchase 9,052,150
            shares of the Company’s common stock had been granted, net of cancellations, and
            options to purchase 6,092,500 shares of the Company’s common stock remain
            available for grant under the 2001 Option Plan.

The 2005 Directors Plan permits the granting of options to purchase up
            to an aggregate of 800,000 shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee
            directors of the Company. On the date of the annual meeting of stockholders at which an
            eligible director is initially elected, each eligible director is entitled to receive a
            one-time grant of an option to purchase 24,000 shares of the Company’s common
            stock exercisable at the closing price for a share of common stock on the date of
            grant. Additionally, on the fifth anniversary of the election of eligible directors
            elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, and each fifth anniversary thereafter,
            each eligible director shall receive an additional grant of an option to purchase
            19,200 shares of the Company’s common stock. Options become

exercisable in four equal installments, with the grant immediately
            vested with respect to 25% of the grant and the remaining installments vesting on the
            three successive anniversaries of the date of grant; provided that all options held by
            an eligible director become fully and immediately exercisable upon a change in control
            of the Company. Options granted under the 2005 Directors Plan that are not exercised
            generally expire ten years after the date of grant. Option grants may be made under the
            2005 Directors Plan for ten years from the effective date of the 2005 Directors Plan.
            The 2005 Directors Plan is a “formula plan” so that a non-employee
            director’s participation in the 2005 Directors Plan does not affect his status as
            a “disinterested person” (as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities
            Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). As of December 31,
            2007, options to purchase 57,600 shares of the Company’s common stock had been
            granted under the 2005 Directors Plan and options to purchase 723,200 shares of the
            Company’s common stock remained available for grant.

Under the Company’s stock option plans, all grants are made at
            prices based on the fair market value of the options on the date of grant. Outstanding
            options generally vest over five years from the grant date and generally expire up to
            ten years after the grant date. The Company recorded $10.2 million and $8.3 million of
            compensation expense relating to outstanding options during the years ended December
            31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No compensation expense was recorded related to
            outstanding options during the year ended December 31, 2005.

The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options
            based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the
            Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the assumptions included in the table
            below. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on
            the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a
            commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached, or
            (2) the date at which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the
            Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the assumptions included in the table
            below. The Company uses historical data to determine the exercise behavior, volatility
            and forfeiture rate of the options. The following weighted-average assumptions were
            used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31,
            2007, 2006 and 2005:

The
            following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable
            at December 31, 2007:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the
            years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $24.06 per share, $17.87 per share and
            $5.48 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during
            the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $133.1 million, $84.0 million and
            $20.5 million, respectively.

Cash received from option exercises under all plans for the years ended
            December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $8.0 million, $3.9 million and $1.2
            million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions from
            non-qualified stock option exercises and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock
            options for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $29.4 million, $17.3
            million and $3.0 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2007, there was $25.7 million of total unrecognized
            compensation expense related to nonvested shares granted to both employees and
            non-employees under the Company’s share-based payment plans. That cost is
            expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.

The table below shows the amounts recognized in the financial statements
            for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 for share-based compensation
            related to employees and non-employees. Employee and non-employee share-based
            compensation expense of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 is comprised
            of $3.4 million that relates to incentive stock options and $6.8 million that relates
            to non-qualified stock options. Employee and non-employee share-based compensation
            expense of $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 is comprised of $2.5
            million that relates to incentive stock options and $5.8 million that relates to
