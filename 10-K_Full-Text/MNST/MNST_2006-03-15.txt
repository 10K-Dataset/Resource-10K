ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

     Hansen Natural  Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1990.
Its principal place of business is at 1010 Railroad Street,  Corona,  California
92882 and its  telephone  number is (951)  739-6200.  When this  report uses the
words "Hansen",  "HBC", "the Company",  "we", "us", and "our", these words refer
to Hansen  Natural  Corporation  and our  subsidiaries  other than  Monster  LDA
Company ("MLDA"), unless the context otherwise requires.

     We are a holding company and carry on no operating  business except through
our direct wholly owned subsidiaries,  Hansen Beverage Company ("HBC") which was
incorporated  in Delaware on June 8, 1992,  and MLDA,  formerly  known as Hard e
Beverage  Company,  and  previously  known  as Hard  Energy  Company  and as CVI
Ventures,  Inc.,  which was  incorporated  in  Delaware on April 30,  1990.  HBC
generates substantially all of our operating revenues.

     We develop,  market,  sell and distribute  "alternative"  beverage category
natural sodas, fruit juices, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice
smoothies  and,  "functional   drinks",   sparkling  lemonades  and  orangeades,
non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails,  children's
multi-vitamin  juice drinks and  non-carbonated  lightly  flavored energy waters
under the Hansen's(R) brand name. We also develop,  market,  sell and distribute
energy drinks under the Monster Energy(R),  Lost(R) Energy,  Rumba(TM) and Joker
Mad Energy(TM) brand names. We also market, sell and distribute,  natural sodas,
premium natural sodas with  supplements,  organic natural sodas,  seltzer waters
and  energy  drinks  under the Blue  Sky(R)  brand  name.  Our fruit  juices for
toddlers are marketed under the Junior Juice(R) brand name. We also market, sell
and  distribute  vitamin  and mineral  drink  mixes in  powdered  form under the
Fizzit(TM) brand name.

     The Company has two  reportable  segments,  namely  Direct  Store  Delivery
("DSD"),  whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse,  whose
principal  products  comprise  juice based and soda  beverages.  The DSD segment
develops,  markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor
network  whereas the  Warehouse  segment  develops,  markets and sells  products
primarily direct to retailers.

Corporate History

     In the 1930s,  Hubert  Hansen and his three sons started a business to sell
fresh  non-pasteurized  juices  in  Los  Angeles,   California.   This  business
eventually became Hansen's Juices,  Inc., which subsequently became known as The
Fresh Juice  Company of  California,  Inc.  ("FJC").  FJC  retained the right to
market and sell fresh  non-pasteurized  juices  under the Hansen  trademark.  In
1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen,  perceived a demand for
pasteurized  natural  juices and juice  blends that are shelf  stable and formed
Hansen Foods, Inc. ("HFI"). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include
Hansen's(R)  natural sodas.  California  Co-Packers  Corporation  (d/b/a/ Hansen
Beverage Company) ("CCC") acquired certain assets of HFI, including the right to
market the  Hansen's(R)  brand name,  in January  1990.  On July 27,  1992,  HBC
acquired the  Hansen's(R)  brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC.
Under our ownership, the Hansen beverage business has significantly expanded and
includes a wide range of  beverages  within the growing  "alternative"  beverage
category including in particular,  energy drinks. In September 1999, we acquired
all of FJC's rights to manufacture,  sell and distribute  fresh  non-pasteurized
juice products under the Hansen's(R)  trademark together with certain additional
rights.  In 2000, HBC,  through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Blue Sky Natural
Beverage Co. ("Blue Sky"),  which was  incorporated  in Delaware on September 8,
2000,  acquired  the natural  soda  business  previously  conducted  by Blue Sky
Natural Beverage Co., a New Mexico corporation ("BSNBC"),  under the Blue Sky(R)
trademark. In 2001, HBC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Hansen Junior Juice
Company,  ("Junior  Juice"),  which was incorporated in Delaware on May 7, 2001,
acquired the Junior Juice business  previously  conducted by Pasco Juices,  Inc.
("Pasco") under the Junior Juice(R) trademark.



Industry Overview

     The alternative  beverage category combines  non-carbonated  ready-to-drink
iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails,  single serve juices and fruit beverages,
ready-to-drink  dairy and coffee  drinks,  energy  drinks,  sports  drinks,  and
single-serve  still water  (flavored,  unflavored  and enhanced)  with "new age"
beverages,  including sodas that are considered  natural,  sparkling  juices and
flavored  sparkling  waters.  The alternative  beverage  category is the fastest
growing  segment of the beverage  marketplace  according  to Beverage  Marketing
Corporation.  According to Beverage  Marketing  Corporation,  wholesale sales in
2005 for the  alternative  beverage  category  of the market  are  provisionally
estimated at $18.7 billion  representing  a growth rate of  approximately  13.7%
over  the  revised  estimated  wholesale  sales in 2004 of  approximately  $16.4
billion.

Products

     Natural Sodas.  Hansen's(R)  natural sodas have been a leading natural soda
brand in  Southern  California  for the past 25  years.  In 2005,  according  to
Information Resources, Inc.'s Analyzer Reports for California, our natural sodas
recorded  the  highest  sales  among  comparable  carbonated  new  age  category
beverages  measured by unit volume in the California  market.  Our natural sodas
are available in fifteen regular flavors  consisting of mandarin lime, key lime,
grapefruit,  raspberry, ginger ale, creamy root beer, grapefruit,  vanilla cola,
cherry vanilla creme,  orange mango, kiwi strawberry,  tropical  passion,  black
cherry,  ginger ale and  tangerine.  In early 2001,  we introduced a new line of
diet sodas using  Splenda(R)  sweetener as the primary  sweetener.  We initially
introduced this line in four flavors:  peach, black cherry,  tangerine lime, and
kiwi  strawberry  and have since added two  additional  flavors,  ginger ale and
creamy root beer. Our natural sodas contain no preservatives,  sodium,  caffeine
or artificial  coloring and are made with high quality natural  flavors,  citric
acid and high fructose corn syrup or, in the case of diet sodas, with Splenda(R)
and Acesulfame-K. We package our natural sodas in 12-ounce and 16-ounce aluminum
cans. In 2002, we introduced a line of natural  mixers in 8-ounce  aluminum cans
comprising club soda, tonic water and ginger ale.

     In January 1999, we introduced a premium line of Signature  Sodas in unique
proprietary 14-ounce glass bottles. This line was marketed under the Hansen's(R)
brand name,  primarily through our distributor network, in six flavors. In early
2003,  we  repositioned  this line into lower cost 12-ounce  glass  packaging to
market our  repositioned  Signature Soda line at lower price points  directly to
our retail  customers  such as grocery  chains,  club stores,  specialty  retail
chains and mass  merchandisers  and to the health food sector through  specialty
and health food  distributors  (collectively  referred to as our "direct  retail
customers").  Signature  Soda is  available  in 12-ounce  glass  bottles in five
flavors:  orange  creme,  vanilla  creme,  ginger beer,  sarsaparilla  and black
cherry.

     In September  2000, we acquired the Blue Sky(R)  natural soda business from
BSNBC. Our Blue Sky product line comprises natural sodas, premium sodas, organic
natural sodas,  seltzer water,  energy drinks and tea sodas. Blue Sky(R) natural
sodas  are  available  in  twelve  regular  flavors  consisting  of lemon  lime,
grapefruit,  cola, root beer,  raspberry,  cherry vanilla creme, Jamaican ginger
ale, black cherry, orange creme, Dr. Becker, grape and cream soda. We also offer
a Blue Sky(R)  product  line,  a premium  line of natural  sodas  which  contain
supplements such as ginseng. This line is available in six flavors consisting of
ginseng  creme,  ginseng  cola,  ginseng  root beer,  ginseng  very berry creme,
ginseng ginger ale, and ginseng  cranberry-raspberry.  During 1999,  Blue Sky(R)
introduced a line of organic  natural sodas,  which are available in six flavors
consisting of prime lime cream,  new century cola,  orange divine,  ginger gale,
black cherry  cherish,  and root beer.  We also market a seltzer water under the
Blue  Sky(R)  label in three  flavors:  natural,  lime and  lemon.  In 2002,  we
introduced a lightly  carbonated  Blue Sky(R) energy drink in an 8.3-ounce  slim
can. In 2004, we introduced a new line of Blue Sky(R)  natural tea sodas in four
flavors consisting of Imperial Lime Green Tea, Peach Mist Green Tea, Pomegranate
White  Tea  and  Raspberry  Red  Tea.  The  Blue  Sky(R)  products   contain  no
preservatives,  sodium or caffeine  (other than the energy  drink) or artificial
coloring and are made with high quality  natural  flavors.  Blue Sky(R)  natural
sodas,  seltzer waters and tea sodas are all packaged in 12-ounce  aluminum cans
and are marketed  primarily to our direct  retail  customers.  In March 2005, we
introduced a new light line of Blue Sky sodas using  natural  sweeteners in four
flavors,  cherry  vanilla  creme,  creamy  root,  Jamaican  ginger  ale and wild
raspberry in 12-ounce  cans.  In the third  quarter of 2005, we introduced a new
line of Blue  Sky(R)  Natural  Sodas  with real sugar in  12-ounce  cans in four
flavors, cherry vanilla creme, cola, ginger ale and root beer. In December 2005,
we  introduced  a new  line of Blue  Sky  Isotonic  Sports  Drinks  in  16-ounce
polyethylene  terephthalate  ("PET") plastic  bottles in three flavors,  orange,
lemon lime and fruit punch.



     In 2001, we introduced a new line of sparkling lemonades (regular and pink)
and orangeades in unique  proprietary  1-liter glass bottles and towards the end
of 2002, we  introduced  diet  versions of our regular  sparkling  lemonades and
orangeades,   also  in  1-liter  glass  bottles.  The  sparkling  lemonades  and
orangeades  contain  real juice and pulp.  In 2003,  we extended  this line into
unique  proprietary  12-ounce  glass bottles in both regular and diet  versions.
This  product  line is marketed to our direct  retail  customers.  The  contract
packer who produced these products on our behalf underwent a change of ownership
and experienced  production  difficulties  which adversely affected this product
line. We are currently evaluating alternative packages for this line.

     Hansen's Energy Drinks. In 1997, we introduced a lightly  carbonated citrus
flavored  Hansen's(R)  energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans. Our energy drink competes
in the "functional" beverage category,  namely, beverages that provide a real or
perceived benefit in addition to simply delivering refreshment.  We also offered
additional  flavors of energy  drinks as well as functional  drinks  including a
ginger  flavored  d-stress(R)  drink,  an orange  flavored  b-well(TM)  drink, a
guarana berry flavored  stamina(R)  drink,  a grape flavored power drink,  and a
berry flavored  "slim-down"  drink that contained no calories,  in the same size
cans.  We have since  discontinued  sales of such  products.  Our energy  drinks
contain  vitamins,  minerals,  nutrients,  herbs and  supplements  (collectively
"supplements").  In 2004,  we commenced  to offer our  Hansen's  energy drink in
16-ounce  cans as well. In 2001, we  introduced  Energade(R),  a  non-carbonated
energy sports drink in 23.5-ounce  cans in two flavors,  citrus and orange,  and
subsequently  introduced  a third  flavor,  red  rocker,  which  we  have  since
discontinued.  We also introduced E2O Energy Water(R), a non-carbonated  lightly
flavored  water,  in  24-ounce  blue  PET  plastic  bottles,  in  four  flavors,
tangerine,  apple,  berry and lemon. We have since discontinued the apple flavor
and  introduced  a green tea flavor in its place.  In 2002,  we expanded our E2O
Energy Water(R) line with four additional  flavors in clear PET plastic bottles,
mango  melon,  kiwi  strawberry,   grapefruit  and  green  tea.  We  have  since
discontinued  the E2O Energy  Water(R)  line in clear PET plastic  bottles.  Our
Energade(R) and E2O Energy Water(R) drinks also contain  different  combinations
and  levels  of  supplements.  We are  currently  repositioning  our E2O  Energy
Water(R)  line.  At the end of 2002,  we  introduced a lightly  carbonated  diet
energy drink in 8.3-ounce  cans under the  Hansen's(R)  Diet Red brand name. Our
Diet Red energy drink is sweetened with Splenda(R) and  Acesulfame-K.  We market
our  energy,   and  Energade(R)   drinks  primarily  through  our  full  service
distributor network. We market our E2O Energy Water(R) drinks in blue bottles to
our direct retail  customers.  In 2003, we  introduced a new  carbonated  energy
drink  under the  Hansen's(R)  Deuce brand name,  in 16-ounce  cans,  but with a
different flavor from our existing  Hansen's(R) Energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans.
We have since discontinued this product.

     Monster  Energy(R)  Drinks.  In 2002, we launched a new  carbonated  energy
drink under the Monster Energy(R) brand name, in 16-ounce cans, which was almost
double the size of our  regular  energy  drinks in  8.3-ounce  cans and the vast
majority of  competitive  energy drinks on the market at that time.  Our Monster
Energy(R)  drink contains  different  types and levels of  supplements  than our
Hansen's(R)  energy drinks and is marketed through our full service  distributor
network.  In 2003, we introduced a low carbohydrate  ("Lo-Carb")  version of our
Monster  Energy(R)  energy drink. In 2004, we introduced  4-packs of our Monster
Energy(R)  drinks  including our Lo-Carb version thereof and, towards the end of
2004, we launched a new Monster Energy(R)  Assault(TM)  energy drink in 16-ounce
cans.  During the first half of 2005, we introduced our Monster Energy(R) drinks
and  Lo-Carb  Monster  Energy(R)  in  24-ounce  size  cans as  well  as  Monster
Energy(R),  Lo-Carb  Monster  Energy(R)  and Monster  Energy(R)  Assault(TM)  in
8.3-ounce  size cans. In September  2005, we introduced a new Monster  Energy(R)
Khaos(TM)  energy drink in 16-ounce  cans.  Khaos(TM) is lightly  carbonated and
contains 70% juice.



     Lost(R) Energy Drinks.  In 2004, we launched a new carbonated  energy drink
under the Lost(R)  brand name,  in 16-ounce  cans.  Towards the end of 2005,  we
introduced a lo-carb  version of Lost(R) under the Perfect 10 brand name as well
as a new Lost(R)  Five-O  energy drink,  all in 16-ounce  cans.  Lost(R)  Five-O
contains 50% juice and is lightly  carbonated.  In December  2005, we introduced
Lost(R) and  Lost(R)  Five-O in 24-ounce  size cans.  The Lost(R)  brand name is
owned  by  Lost  International  LLC  and  the  drinks  are  produced,  sold  and
distributed by us under exclusive license from Lost International LLC.

     Rumba(TM) Energy Juice. In December 2004, we launched a new  non-carbonated
energy juice under the Rumba(TM) brand name in 15.5-ounce  cans.  Rumba(TM) is a
100% juice product that targets male and female morning  beverage  consumers and
is positioned as a substitute for coffee,  caffeinated  sodas and 100% orange or
other juices.

     Joker Mad  Energy(TM)  Drink.  In the first  quarter of 2005, we introduced
Joker Mad Energy(TM)  drinks in 16-ounce cans. Joker Mad Energy(TM)  drinks come
in both regular and lo-carb versions in 16-ounce cans.

     Juice  Products  and  Smoothies.  Our fruit  juice  product  line  includes
Hansen's(R)  Natural Old Fashioned Apple Juice which is packaged in 64-ounce PET
plastic  bottles and 128-ounce  polypropylene  bottles and White Grape,  Concord
Grape,  Orange, and Pomegranate,  Apple Strawberry and Apple Grape juice blends,
in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles.  These  Hansen's(R) juice products contain 100%
juice  (except  Pomegranate  which  contains  27%  juice) as well as  Vitamin C.
Certain of these products also contain added calcium. Hansen's(R) juice products
compete in the shelf-stable juice category. In 2002, we extended our fruit juice
and juice  blend  product  line by  introducing  certain  of these  products  in
10-ounce  PET  plastic  bottles  and in 2003  further  extended  our fruit juice
product  line  by  introducing  a 100%  Apple  Juice  in  aseptic  pouches  in a
6.75-ounce  size. We also offer light juices and juice cocktails in 64-ounce PET
plastic bottles.

     In March  1995,  we  introduced  a line of fruit juice  smoothie  drinks in
11.5-ounce aluminum cans. Certain flavors were subsequently offered in glass and
PET plastic  bottles.  We have since  discontinued  offering  smoothies in those
packages. Hansen's fruit juice smoothies have a smooth texture that is thick but
lighter than a nectar.  Hansen's  smoothies in 11.5-ounce  aluminum cans contain
approximately  35%  juice.  Our  fruit  juice  smoothies  provide  100%  of  the
recommended  daily  intake  for  adults  of  Vitamins  A, C & E and  represented
Hansen's entry into what is commonly  referred to as the  "functional"  beverage
category.  Hansen's(R)  fruit juice smoothies are available in thirteen flavors:
strawberry  banana,  peach berry, mango pineapple,  guava strawberry,  pineapple
coconut,  apricot nectar, tropical passion,  whipped orange, cranberry twist, as
well as the blast line  comprising  Island  Blast,  Colada Blast and Power Berry
Blast. In 2004, we repositioned our cranberry raspberry lite smoothie as part of
our new lo-carb line of smoothies.  Our lo-carb smoothie line currently consists
of peach, mango and cran-raspberry flavors in 12-ounce cans.

     In 2001,  we  introduced  a new line of soy  smoothies  in 32- and 11-ounce
aseptic packaging in five flavors: berry splash,  tropical breeze, orange dream,
lemon chiffon and peach  passion.  During 2004, we  discontinued  all of our soy
smoothies in 32-ounce aseptic packaging and four of the five flavors in 11-ounce
aseptic packaging, leaving Berry Splash, which was discontinued in 2005.

     Sparkling  Apple Cider. In 2002, we introduced a Sparkling Cider 100% juice
drink in a  1.5-liter  Magnum  glass  bottle.  However,  due to  reports of some
bottles  breaking we  promptly  voluntarily  recalled  the product in the fourth
quarter of 2003. We are pursuing a claim against the third-party bottler for the
costs and losses  incurred by us. We will  reevaluate  relaunching  this product
once certain  production  issues are resolved and a suitable  co-packer has been
identified.



     We market  the above  juice and  smoothie  products  to our  direct  retail
customers.

     Iced  Teas,  Lemonades  and  Juice  Cocktails.  We  introduced  Hansen's(R)
ready-to-drink iced teas and lemonades in 1993. Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink iced
teas are available in three  flavors:  Original with Lemon,  Tropical  Peach and
Wildberry.  Lemonades  are  available  in one  flavor:  Original  Old  Fashioned
Lemonade.  Hansen's(R) juice cocktails were introduced in 1994 and are available
in three flavors: kiwi strawberry melon, tangerine pineapple with passion fruit,
and  California  paradise  punch.  We  introduced a variety 12 pack of iced teas
during  the  first  half of 2001,  which  experienced  limited  success.  We are
continuing  to  market  this  package.  Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink  iced  teas,
lemonades  and juice  cocktails  were  packaged  in  16-ounce  wide-mouth  glass
bottles.  At the end of 2002, we converted this line from 16-ounce glass bottles
to 16-ounce polypropylene bottles and are currently reevaluating this line.

     Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink  iced  teas are made  with  decaffeinated  tea.
Hansen's(R)  juice  products and smoothies are made with high quality juices and
products  that  contain  less than 100% fruit  juice are also made with  natural
flavors, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid and other ingredients.

     In 1999, we introduced a line of specialty  teas in 20-ounce glass bottles,
which  we named  our  "Gold  Standard"  line.  We  subsequently  introduced  two
additional green tea flavors as well as two diet green tea flavors and six juice
cocktails.  We have  discontinued  certain of the specialty  teas and all of the
juice cocktails but continue to market four products, green tea, lemon green tea
and  peach  green  tea as well as the diet  peach  green  tea  flavor.  Our Gold
Standard  line also  contains  supplements.  We  continue  to  package  our Gold
Standard Line in unique 20-ounce glass bottles.

     Juices for Children.  In 1999,  we  introduced  two new lines of children's
multi-vitamin  juice drinks in 8.45-ounce aseptic packages.  Each drink contains
eleven essential vitamins and six essential  minerals.  We introduce new flavors
in place of  existing  flavors  from  time to time.  One of these two lines is a
dual-branded  100%  juice  line  named  Juice  Blast(R)  that  was  launched  in
conjunction  with Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  ("Costco") and is sold through
Costco  stores.  The other  line was a 10% juice  line  named  "Hansens  Natural
Multi-Vitamin  Juice Slam(R) that was available to all of our customers.  During
2000,  we  repositioned  that line as a 100% juice line under the Juice  Slam(R)
name and market  that line to grocery  store  chain  customers,  the health food
trade, and other customers.  Both the Juice Blast(R) and Juice Slam(R) lines are
marketed in 6.75-ounce aseptic packages. The Juice Slam(R) line has four flavors
and the Juice Blast(R) line has three flavors.

     In May 2001, we acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business.  The Junior
Juice(R)  product line is comprised of seven flavors of 100% juice in 4.23-ounce
aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. Six flavors of the Junior Juice(R)
line have  calcium  added and all  flavors  have  vitamin C added.  The  current
flavors in the Junior Juice(R) line are apple, apple berry,  orange twist, apple
grape, mixed fruit, fruit punch and white grape.

     Bottled  Water.  Our still water  products were  introduced in 1993 and are
primarily sold in 0.5-liter plastic bottles to the food service trade.  Sales of
this product line are very limited.

     Fizzit(TM) Powdered Drink Mixes. In December 2005, we introduced a new line
of vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the  Fizzit(TM)  brand
name.  This line  includes  vitamin and mineral  formulas as well as  functional
formulas.



 Other Products

     We  continue to  evaluate  and,  where  considered  appropriate,  introduce
additional  flavors and other types of  beverages  to  complement  our  existing
product lines.  We will also evaluate,  and may, where  considered  appropriate,
introduce  functional   foods/snack  foods  that  utilize  similar  channels  of
distribution  and/or are  complementary to our existing products and/or to which
our brand names are able to add value.

     We also  develop and supply,  on a limited  basis,  selected  beverages  in
different  formats  to a  limited  number of  customers  with the  objective  of
solidifying our relationship with those customers.

Manufacture and Distribution

     We do not  directly  manufacture  our products  but instead  outsource  the
manufacture to third party bottlers and contract packers.

     We purchase  concentrates,  juices,  flavors,  supplements,  caps,  labels,
trays, boxes and other ingredients for our beverage products which are delivered
to our various third party  bottlers and  co-packers.  Depending on the product,
the third party bottlers or packers add filtered water and/or high fructose corn
syrup, or sucrose,  or cane sugar or Splenda(R)  brand  sweetener,  Acesulfame-K
and/or citric acid or other  ingredients and supplements for the manufacture and
packaging of the finished  products into approved  containers in accordance with
our  formulas.  In the  case  of  sodas  and  other  carbonated  beverages,  the
bottler/packer  adds  carbonation  to the  products  as part  of the  production
process.

     We are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase of and delivery
to our third  party  bottlers  and  co-packers  of the  containers  in which our
beverage products are packaged.

     All of our  beverage  products  are  manufactured  by various  third  party
bottlers and co-packers  situated  throughout the United States and Canada under
separate   arrangements  with  each  of  such  parties.   The  majority  of  our
co-packaging arrangements are on a month-to-month basis. However, certain of our
material co-packing arrangements are described below:

     (a) Our agreement with Southwest Canning and Packaging,  Inc. ("Southwest")
pursuant to which Southwest packages a portion of our Hansen's(R) natural sodas.
This contract continues  indefinitely and is subject to termination upon 60 days
written notice from either party.

     (b) Our agreement with Nor-Cal Beverage Co., Inc.  ("Nor-Cal")  pursuant to
which  Nor-Cal  packages  a portion  of our  Hansen's(R)  juices in PET  plastic
bottles.  This contract  continues  until August 2007 and is renewable  annually
thereafter from year-to-year unless terminated by Hansen's not less than 60 days
before the end of the then current term.

     (c) Our agreement with Seven-Up/RC Bottling Company of Southern California,
Inc.  ("Seven-Up")  pursuant  to  which  Seven-Up  packages  a  portion  of  our
Monster(TM)  and Lost(R)  brand energy  drinks and a portion of our  Hansen's(R)
natural sodas. This contract  continues until March 2009. Upon termination prior
to such time we are entitled to recover certain  equipment we have purchased and
installed at Seven-Up's facility.

     (d)  Our   agreement   with   Southeast   Atlantic   Beverage   Corporation
("Southeast")  pursuant  to which  Southeast  packages a portion of our  Monster
Energy(R) and Lost(R) brand energy drinks.  This contract  continues  until July
2007 and is renewable annually thereafter, unless terminated by either party not
less than 180 days prior to the end of the then current term.

     (e) Our agreement with City Brewing  Company LLC ("City Brew")  pursuant to
which City Brew packages a portion of our  Energade(R)  energy sports drinks and
energy drinks in 16 and 24-ounce cans.  This contract  continues  until December
2006.  Either party is entitled,  at any time, to terminate  the agreement  upon
ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party.



     (f) Our agreement with Pri-Pak,  Inc. ("Pri-Pak") pursuant to which Pri-Pak
packages  a portion  of our  energy  drinks in  8.3-ounce  cans.  This  contract
continues  indefinitely  but may be  terminated at any time by either party upon
ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other.

     (g) Our agreement with Gluek Brewing  Company  ("Gluek")  pursuant to which
Gluek  packages a portion of our energy drinks in 8.3,  15.5 and 16-ounce  cans.
This contract  continues until August 2008 and is automatically  renewed for one
year periods  thereafter.  Either party is entitled at any time to terminate the
agreement upon 180 days prior written notice to the other party.

     In certain  instances,  equipment is  purchased by us and  installed at the
facilities of our co-packers to enable them to produce  certain of our products.
In general, such equipment remains our property and is to be returned to us upon
termination  of the packing  arrangements  with such  co-packers or is amortized
over a pre-determined  number of cases that are to be produced at the facilities
concerned.

     We pack certain  products  outside of the West Coast region to enable us to
produce  products  closer to the markets where they are sold and thereby  reduce
freight costs. As volumes in markets outside of California  grow, we continue to
secure additional packing  arrangements closer to such markets to further reduce
freight costs.

     Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise,  particularly
with new  products,  and may be less  precise  during  periods of rapid  growth,
particularly  in new  markets.  If we  materially  underestimate  demand for our
products  or are  unable  to  secure  sufficient  ingredients  or raw  materials
including, but not limited to, glass, PET/plastic bottles, cans, labels, flavors
or supplement  ingredients or certain sweeteners,  or packing  arrangements,  we
might not be able to satisfy  demand on a  short-term  basis.  The  supplier  of
sucralose has notified the Company that our  purchases of sucralose  during 2006
will be subject to volume limitations due to the demand for sucralose  exceeding
their  production  capacity.  While we  believe  that we will be able to  secure
sufficient  quantities  of  sucralose  during  2006 to meet the  demand  for our
products that contain sucralose,  we will reformulate  certain of those products
that  contain   sucralose  with  alternative   sweetener  systems  to  avoid  an
interruption in supply of those products, should the need arise.

     Although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are
terminable  upon  request,  we  believe a short  disruption  or delay  would not
significantly  affect our revenues since alternative  packing  facilities in the
United  States with  adequate  capacity  can usually be obtained for many of our
products at commercially  reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
period.  However, there are limited packing facilities in the United States with
adequate  capacity  and/or  suitable  equipment for many of our newer  products,
including  Hansen's(R)  brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce and 16-ounce cans, Gold
Standard line,  aseptic juice  products,  Energade(R),  sparkling apple cider in
1.5-liter magnum glass bottles, Monster Energy(R),  Lost(R), Rumba(TM) and Joker
Mad  Energy(TM)  energy drinks in 8.3, 15.5, 16, and 24-ounce cans and sparkling
lemonades and orangeade  lines.  There are also limited  shrink sleeve  labeling
facilities  available to us in the United States with adequate  capacity for our
E2O Energy Water(R). A disruption or delay in production of any of such products
could  significantly  affect our  revenues  from such  products  as  alternative
co-packing  facilities in the United  States with  adequate  capacity may not be
available  for such  products  either at  commercially  reasonable  rates and/or
within a reasonably short time period, if at all. Consequently,  a disruption in
production  of such  products  could  affect our  revenues.  We continue to seek
alternative  and/or  additional  co-packing  facilities  in the United States or
Canada with  adequate  capacity for the  production  of our various  products to
minimize the risk of any disruption in production.

     We have entered into  distribution  agreements for the distribution in most
states of Hansen's(R) brand energy drinks,  Monster  Energy(R)  drinks,  Lost(R)
energy drinks,  and Energade(R) energy sports drinks.  Distribution  levels vary
from state to state and from  product to product.  Certain of our  products  are
sold in Canada.  We also sell a limited  range of our  products to  distributors
outside of the United States,  including in Mexico,  the Caribbean , Central and
South America, Japan, Korea, and Saudi Arabia.



     We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into
agreements  with regional  bottlers or other direct store delivery  distributors
having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.  Many of our
bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture  and/or distribute
other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many cases,
such products compete directly with our products.

     We continue to take steps to reduce our inventory  levels in an endeavor to
lower our warehouse and distribution costs.

     During 2005, we continued to expand  distribution  of our natural sodas and
smoothies outside of California. We expanded our national sales force to support
and grow sales,  primarily of Monster Energy(R)  drinks,  Lost(R) energy drinks,
and  Energade(R)  energy  sports  drinks and we intend to continue to build such
sales force in 2006.

     Our Blue  Sky(R)  products  are sold  primarily  to the health  food trade,
natural food chains and  mainstream  grocery  store  chains,  through  specialty
health food distributors.

     We concluded  exclusive  contracts  with the State of California  ("State")
Department of Health Services,  Women, Infant and Children ("WIC")  Supplemental
Nutrition  Branch ("DHS") to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice,  in
64-ounce PET plastic bottles. The contracts are each for a period of three years
with a further  one-year  extension option to be mutually agreed between Hansens
and the State of California. We bid the lowest net cost per unit in terms of the
wholesale  price,  less a rebate to the State.  Formal written  agreements  were
signed  with  the  State  in  accordance  with the bid  process.  The  contracts
commenced on July 12, 2004.

     Under the contracts Hansen's is the exclusive supplier for both Apple Juice
and the blended  juice  category,  a new WIC category,  initially  with our 100%
Apple Grape Juice.  During 2005, our Apple  Strawberry Juice was approved within
the blended  juice  category and became  eligible for  redemption  under the WIC
contract  in  addition to our 100% Apple Grape  Juice.  The WIC  contracts  have
expanded the distribution of Hansens juices, resulting in increased exposure for
the Hansens  brand.  WIC-approved  items are stocked by the grocery trade and by
WIC-only stores.  Products are purchased by WIC consumers with vouchers given by
the DHS to qualified  participants.

     Our principal  warehouse  and  distribution  center and  corporate  offices
relocated to our current facility in October 2000. In January 2004, we leased an
additional warehouse facility in Corona to consolidate additional space that had
been leased by us on short term  leases from time to time to meet our  increased
warehousing  needs due to  increases  in both sales  volumes  and  products  and
terminated  the two short term  leases  concerned.  We continue to take steps to
reduce our  inventory  levels  wherever  possible,  in an  endeavor to lower our
warehouse and distribution costs. (See also "PART I ITEM 2 PROPERTIES").

Raw Materials and Suppliers

     The  principal  raw  materials  used by us comprise  aluminum  cans,  glass
bottles and PET plastic  bottles as well as juices,  high  fructose  corn syrup,
sucrose and sucralose,  the costs of which are subject to  fluctuations.  Due to
the consolidations that have taken place in the glass industry over the past few
years,  the prices of glass  bottles  continue  to  increase.  The prices of PET
plastic  bottles and aluminum  cans have  increased in 2005.  The prices of high
fructose corn syrup,  sucrose and certain juice concentrates have also increased
in 2005. These increased costs together with increased costs primarily of energy
and gas and freight  resulted in  increases in certain  product  costs which are
ongoing and are expected to continue to exert  pressure on our gross  margins in
2006. We are uncertain whether the prices of these or any other raw materials or
ingredients will continue to rise in the future.



     Generally,  raw  materials  utilized  by us in  our  business  are  readily
available from numerous sources. However, certain raw materials are manufactured
by only one  company.  Sucralose,  which is used  alone or in  combination  with
Acesulfame-K in the Company's  low-calorie  products,  is purchased by us from a
single  manufacturer.  Certain  of our cans are  only  manufactured  by a single
company in the United States.

     With  regard to fruit  juice and  juice-drink  products,  the  industry  is
subject to variability of weather conditions,  which may result in higher prices
and/or lower consumer demand for juices.

     We  purchase   beverage   flavors,   concentrates,   juices,   supplements,
high-fructose corn syrup, cane sugar, sucrose, sucralose and other sweeteners as
well as other  ingredients  from  independent  suppliers  located  in the United
States and abroad.

     Generally,  flavor suppliers hold the proprietary  rights to their flavors.
Consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors
and certain of our concentrates  readily available to us and we may be unable to
obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice.
We have identified alternative suppliers of many of the supplements contained in
many of our beverages.  However,  industry-wide  shortages of certain fruits and
fruit juices,  and supplements and sweeteners have been and could,  from time to
time in the future,  be  experienced,  which could  interfere  with and/or delay
production of certain of our products.

     We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of
our  flavors  and  concentrates  from  other  suppliers  as well as to  conclude
arrangements  with  suppliers  which would enable us to obtain access to certain
concentrates or flavor formulas in certain circumstances. We have been partially
successful  in these  endeavors.  Additionally,  in a  limited  number of cases,
contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and
licenses  may  limit our  ability  to enter  into  agreements  with  alternative
suppliers and manufacturers and/or distributors.

     In connection with the development of new products and flavors, independent
suppliers  bear a large portion of the expense of product  development,  thereby
enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively  low cost. We have
historically developed and successfully  introduced new products and flavors and
packaging  for our products and intend to continue  developing  and  introducing
additional new beverages and flavors.

Competition

     The  beverage  industry  is  highly  competitive.  The  principal  areas of
competition are pricing, packaging,  development of new products and flavors and
marketing  campaigns.  Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced
by a relatively large number of manufacturers,  most of which have substantially
greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.

     Important  factors  affecting our ability to compete  successfully  include
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective
development  of new,  unique  cutting edge  products,  attractive  and different
packaging,  branded  product  advertising  and  pricing.  We  also  compete  for
distributors  who will  concentrate  on marketing our products over those of our
competitors,  provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf
space in retail outlets.  Competitive  pressures in the alternative,  energy and
functional  beverage categories could cause our products to be unable to gain or
to lose market share or we could  experience  price erosion,  which could have a
material adverse affect on our business and results.



     Over the past five years we have experienced  substantial  competition from
new entrants in the energy drink category.  A number of companies who market and
distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in larger volume  packages,  such as 16
and 20-ounce glass bottles,  including Sobe, Snapple Elements, Arizona and Fuse,
have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products
as  "functional"  or "energy"  beverages or as having  functional  benefits.  We
believe that many of those  products  contain  lower levels of  supplements  and
principally  deliver  refreshment.  In addition,  many competitive  products are
positioned  differently than our energy or functional  drinks. Our smoothies and
Gold Standard lines are positioned more closely against those products.

     We compete not only for consumer acceptance, but also for maximum marketing
efforts by multi-brand  licensed  bottlers,  brokers and  distributors,  many of
which have a principal  affiliation  with  competing  companies and brands.  Our
products  compete with all liquid  refreshments and with products of much larger
and  substantially  better  financed  competitors,  including  the  products  of
numerous  nationally and  internationally  known producers such as The Coca Cola
Company,  PepsiCo, Inc., Cadbury Schweppes plc, Red Bull Gmbh, Kraft Foods, Inc.
Nestle  Beverage  Company,  Tree  Top and  Ocean  Spray.  We also  compete  with
companies  that are smaller or primarily  local in operation.  Our products also
compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains,
convenience store chains, and club stores.

     Our natural sodas compete directly with traditional soda products including
those  marketed by The Coca-Cola Company,  PepsiCo,  Inc. and Cadbury  Schweppes
plc, as well as with carbonated beverages marketed by smaller or primarily local
companies such as Jones Soda Co., Clearly  Canadian  Beverage  Company,  Crystal
Geyser,  J.M.  Smucker  Company,  and with  private  label  brands such as those
carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.

     Our fruit juice smoothies  compete directly with Kern's,  Jumex,  Jugos del
Valle and Libby's  nectars,  V8  Smoothies,  as well as with single  serve juice
products produced by many competitors. Such competitive products are packaged in
glass and PET bottles  ranging from 8- to  48-ounces  in size and in  11.5-ounce
aluminum cans. The juice content of such competitive  products ranges from 1% to
100%.

     Our apple and other juice products  compete directly with Tree Top, Mott's,
Martinelli's,  Welch's, Ocean Spray, Tropicana,  Minute Maid, Langers, Apple and
Eve,  Seneca,  Northland  and also with  other  brands of apple  juice and juice
blends, especially store brands.

     Our  energy  drinks,   including  Hansen's(R)  energy,  Diet  Red,  Monster
Energy(R),  Lost(R) Energy,  Joker Mad Energy(TM) and Rumba(TM)  Energy Juice in
8.3,  15.5, 16 and 24-ounce  cans,  compete  directly with Red Bull,  Adrenaline
Rush, Amp,  Rockstar,  No Fear, Full Throttle,  180, KMX, Venom,  Extreme Energy
Shot, US energy, Red Devil, Rip It, Nos, Boo Koo, Lipovitan,  MET-Rx, Hype, XTC,
and  many  other  brands.  In  addition,  certain  large  companies  such as The
Coca-Cola  Company and Pepsico Inc.  market and/or  distribute  products in that
market segment such as Mountain Dew,  Mountain Dew MDX, Vault,  Adrenaline Rush,
Amp, No Fear, Full Throttle and Rockstar.

     Our E2O Energy  Water(R) and still water  products  compete  directly  with
Vitamin Water, Reebok, Propel, Dasani, Aquafina, Fruit2O, Evian, Crystal Geyser,
Naya, Palomar Mountain, Sahara, Arrowhead,  Dannon, and other brands of flavored
water and still water especially store brands.

Sales and Marketing

     We focus on consumers  who seek  products  that are perceived to be natural
and  healthy  and  emphasize  the  natural   ingredients   and  the  absence  of
preservatives,  sodium, artificial coloring and caffeine in our beverages (other
than our energy drinks) and the addition to most of our products, of one or more
supplements. We reinforce this message in our product packaging.



     Our sales and  marketing  strategy  is to focus our  efforts on  developing
brand  awareness  and trial  through  sampling  both in stores  and at events in
respect of all our  beverages and drink mixes.  We use our branded  vehicles and
other  promotional  vehicles at events at which we  distribute  our  products to
consumers for sampling.  We utilize "push-pull" methods to achieve maximum shelf
and display space  exposure in sales outlets and maximum  demand from  consumers
for our  products  including  advertising,  in  store  promotions  and in  store
placement  of  point  of sale  materials  and  racks,  prize  promotions,  price
promotions,  competitions,  endorsements from selected public and extreme sports
figures,  coupons,  sampling and  sponsorship of selected  causes such as breast
cancer  research  and  SPCA's as well as  extreme  sports  teams such as the Pro
Circuit - Kawasaki Motocross team, extreme sports figures and athletes, sporting
events such as the Energy Pro Pipeline Surfing competition, marathons, 10k runs,
bicycle  races,  volleyball  tournaments  and other  health and  sports  related
activities,  including extreme sports, particularly supercross,  freestyle motor
cross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, BMX, mountain
biking,  snowmobile racing, etc. and also participate in product demonstrations,
food tasting and other related  events.  Posters,  print,  radio and  television
advertising  together with price promotions and coupons are also used to promote
our brands.

     Additionally, in 2003 we entered into a multi-year sponsorship agreement to
advertise  on the new Las Vegas  Monorail  ("Monorail  Agreement")  with the Las
Vegas  Monorail  Company  ("LVMC")  which includes the right to vend our Monster
Energy(R)  drinks and natural  sodas on all  stations.  The initial  term of the
Monorail  Agreement  commenced in July 2004. For technical  reasons the Monorail
did not operate for some months in 2004 but recommenced  carrying  passengers at
the end of December 2004. The initial term of the Monorail Agreement ends on the
first  anniversary of its  commencement  date. Not less than 120 days before the
expiration  of the initial  term and each renewal  term,  as the case may be, we
have the right to renew the Monorail Agreement for a further one year term up to
a maximum of nine  additional  one year  terms and the LVMC has the  right,  not
withstanding  such  election by us, to terminate  the Monorail  Agreement at the
expiration of the then current term.  Due to the  interruption  in operations of
the  Monorail,  the  commencement  date of the initial term was extended and the
agreement commenced on January 1, 2005. We have renewed our agreement for 2006.

     We  believe  that one of the keys to success in the  beverage  industry  is
differentiation  such as making Hansen's(R)  products visually  distinctive from
other  beverages  on the  shelves  of  retailers.  We review  our  products  and
packaging  on an  ongoing  basis and,  where  practical,  endeavor  to make them
different,  better and unique.  The labels and graphics for many of our products
are   redesigned   from  time  to  time  to  maximize   their   visibility   and
identification,  wherever  they may be placed in stores and we will  continue to
reevaluate the same from time to time.

     Where  appropriate  we  partner  with  retailers  to assist  our  marketing
efforts.  For example,  while we retain  responsibility for the marketing of the
Juice  Slam(R)  line  of  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks,  Costco  has
undertaken partial responsibility for the marketing of the Juice Blast(R) line.

     We  increased   expenditures  for  our  sales  and  marketing  programs  by
approximately 55% in 2005 compared to 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we employed
363 employees in sales and marketing activities, of which 183 were employed on a
full-time basis.



Customers

     Our  customers  are  typically   retail   grocery  and  specialty   chains,
wholesalers,  club stores,  drug, mass  merchandisers,  convenience chains, full
service  beverage  distributors,  health  food  distributors  and  food  service
customers. Sales to our various customer types for 2005 are reflected below. The
allocations  below  reflect  changes  made  by the  Company  to  the  categories
historically reported.

  Retail Grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers                           19%
  Club stores, drug & mass merchandisers                                     11%
  Full service distributors                                                  65%
  Health food distributors                                                    3%
  Other                                                                       2%

     Our customers  include Dr. Pepper  Bottling/7UP  Bottling  Group,  Wal-Mart
(including Sams Club),  Kalil Bottling Group,  Trader Joe's,  Seven-Up Companies
Northern California, Costco, Albertson's,  Kroger and Safeway. A decision by any
large  customer  to  decrease  amounts  purchased  from the  Company or to cease
carrying our products  could have a material  negative  effect on our  financial
condition and  consolidated  results of operations.  One customer  accounted for
approximately  18% and 13% of the Company's  sales for the years ended  December
31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Seasonality

     Sales of ready-to-drink  beverages are somewhat  seasonal,  with the second
and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume
of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather  conditions.  Sales
of  our  beverage   products  may  become   increasingly   subject  to  seasonal
fluctuations  as more sales  occur  outside of  California  with  respect to the
Hansen's  products.  However,  the  energy  drink  category  appears  to be less
seasonal than traditional beverages.

Intellectual Property

     We own  numerous  trademarks  that  are  very  important  to our  business.
Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use
and/or their  registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found
to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as
long as the  trademarks are in use. We also own the copyright in and to numerous
statements made and content appearing on the packaging of our products.

     We own the Hansen's(R) trademark. This trademark is crucial to our business
and is  registered  in the U.S.  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  and in  various
countries  throughout the world. We own a number of other trademarks  including,
but not  limited  to, A New  Kind a  Buzz(TM)  ,Unleash  the  Beast(R),  Hansens
Energy(R),  Blue  Energy(R),  Energade(R),  Hansen's E2O Energy  Water(R),  Slim
Down(R),  Power  Formula(R),  THE  REAL  DEAL(R),  LIQUIDFRUIT(R),  California's
Natural Choice(R),  Medicine Man(R), Hansen's power(R),  b-well(R),  anti-ox(R),
d-stress(R),     stamina(R),     Antioxjuice    Intellijuice(R),     Defense(R),
Immunejuice(R),  Hansen's Natural Multi-Vitamin Juice Slam(R),  Juice Blast(R) ,
Red Rocker(R),  Monster  Energy(R),  M  (stylized)(R),  M Monster  Energy(R) and
Hansen's  Natural  Soda(R)  in  the  United  States  and,  the  Hansen's(R)  and
Smoothie(R) trademarks in a number of countries around the world.

     We have applied to register a number of trademarks in the United States and
elsewhere  including,  but not  limited  to,  Monster(TM),  Assault(TM),  Energy
Pro(TM),  Khaos(TM),  M  Monster  Mutant(TM),   Monster  Mutant(TM),  Joker  Mad
Energy(TM), Rumba(TM), Fizzit(TM) and Fizz Bomb(TM).



     In September  2000,  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the Blue Sky
Natural  Beverage  business,  we, through our wholly owned  subsidiary Blue Sky,
acquired the Blue Sky(R) trademark, which is registered in the United States and
Canada.

     In May  2001,  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the  Junior  Juice
beverage  business,  we,  through  our wholly  owned  subsidiary  Junior  Juice,
acquired  the  Junior  Juice(R)  trademark,  which is  registered  in the United
States.

     On April 4, 2000,  the United States  Patent and Trademark  Office issued a
patent to us for an invention  related to a shelf structure  (rolling rack) and,
more particularly,  a shelf structure for a walk-in cooler. Such shelf structure
is utilized by us to secure  shelf space for and to  merchandise  our energy and
functional  drinks in cans in  refrigerated  Visi coolers and walk-in coolers in
retail stores.

Government Regulation

     The production,  distribution  and sale in the United States of many of our
products is subject to the Federal  Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act;  the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational  Safety and Health
Act; various environmental  statutes; and various other federal, state and local
statutes and  regulations  applicable to the production,  transportation,  sale,
safety, advertising,  labeling and ingredients of such products.  California law
requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component
listed by the State as having been found to cause cancer or birth  defects.  The
law exposes all food and  beverage  producers  to the  possibility  of having to
provide  warnings on their  products  because the law  recognizes  no  generally
applicable  quantitative  thresholds  below  which a  warning  is not  required.
Consequently,  even trace  amounts  of listed  components  can  expose  affected
products  to  the  prospect  of  warning  labels.   Products  containing  listed
substances  that occur  naturally in the product or that are  contributed to the
product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning
requirement.  While  none of our  beverage  products  are  required  to  display
warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any
of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are
unable to predict  whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have
an impact on costs or sales of our products.

     Measures  have been enacted in various  localities  and states that require
that a deposit be charged for certain  non-refillable  beverage containers.  The
precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or
product  stewardship  proposals  have been  introduced  in  certain  states  and
localities  and in  Congress,  and we  anticipate  that similar  legislation  or
regulations  may be  proposed  in the  future at the  local,  state and  federal
levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.

     Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local
environmental  laws and  regulations.  Compliance with these  provisions has not
had, and we do not expect such  compliance to have, any material  adverse effect
upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Employees

     As of December 31, 2005,  we employed a total of 476 employees of which 290
were  employed  on a full-time  basis.  Of our 476  employees,  we employ 113 in
administrative and operational capacities and 363 persons in sales and marketing
capacities.  We  have  not  experienced  any  work  stoppages,  and we  consider
relations with our employees to be good.

  Compliance with Environmental Laws

     In  California,  we are  required  to collect  redemption  values  from our
customers  and to remit  such  redemption  values  to the  State  of  California
Department of Conservation  based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain
carbonated and non-carbonated  products sold. In certain other states and Canada
where  Hansen's(R)  products are sold, we are also required to collect  deposits
from our customers and to remit such deposits to the  respective  state agencies
based  upon  the  number  of  cans  and  bottles  of  certain   carbonated   and
non-carbonated products sold in such states.

ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other  information in this report,  you should carefully
consider the following  risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, our
business,  financial  condition  and/or  operating  results  could be materially
adversely affected.  The risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we
face.  Additional risks and  uncertainties  not currently known to us or that we
currently  deem to be  immaterial  also  may  materially  adversely  affect  our
business, financial condition and/or operating results.

Increased competition could hurt our business.

     The  beverage  industry  is  highly  competitive.  The  principal  areas of
competition are pricing, packaging,  development of new products and flavors and
marketing  campaigns.  Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced
by a relatively large number of manufacturers,  most of which have substantially
greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.

     Important  factors  affecting our ability to compete  successfully  include
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective
development  of new,  unique  cutting edge  products,  attractive  and different
packaging,  branded product  advertising and pricing.  Our products compete with
all liquid  refreshments  and with  products  of much  larger and  substantially
better financed  competitors,  including the products of numerous nationally and
internationally  known  producers such as The Coca-Cola  Company,  Pepsico Inc.,
Cadbury Schweppes plc, Red Bull Gmbh, Kraft Foods Inc., Nestle Beverage Company,
Tree Top and Ocean Spray.  We also compete  with  companies  that are smaller or
primarily  local in  operation.  Our products  also  compete with private  label
brands such as those carried by grocery store chains,  convenience store chains,
and  club  stores.  There  can  be no  assurance  that  we  will  not  encounter
difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due
to competition in the beverage industry.  If our revenues decline, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We  derive a  substantial  portion  of  revenues  from  our  energy  drinks  and
competitive  pressure in the "energy drink" category could adversely  affect our
operating results.

     A  substantial  portion of our sales are  derived  from our energy  drinks,
including in  particular  our Monster  Energy(R)  brand energy  drinks.  Our DSD
segment which comprises primarily energy drinks,  represented 77.4% of net sales
for the year ended  December 31, 2005.  Any decrease in the sales of our Monster
Energy(R) brand energy drinks could  significantly  adversely  affect our future
revenues  and  net  income.   Historically,   we  have  experienced  substantial
competition  from new entrants in the energy drink  category.  Our energy drinks
compete directly with Red Bull,  Adrenaline Rush, Amp,  Rockstar,  No Fear, Full
Throttle,  180, KMX, Venom,  Extreme Energy Shot, US energy,  Red Devil, Rip It,
Nos, Boo Koo, Lipovitan,  MET-Rx,  Hype, XTC, and many other brands. A number of
companies who market and distribute  iced teas and juice  cocktails in different
packages,  such  as 16 and  20-ounce  glass  bottles,  including  Sobe,  Snapple
Elements,  Arizona,  Fuse,  and Vitamin Water,  have added  supplements to their
products with a view to marketing  their  products as  "functional"  or "energy"
beverages or as having functional benefits. In addition, certain large companies
such as The Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. market and/or distribute products
in that market segment such as Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew MDX, Vault, Adrenaline
Rush, Amp, No Fear, Full Throttle,  and Rockstar.  Competitive  pressures in the
energy drink  category  could impact our revenues or we could  experience  price
erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse affect
on our business and results.

Change in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products.

     There is increasing  awareness and concern for the health  consequences  of
obesity.  This may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages,  which could affect
our profitability.



     Consumers  are  seeking  greater  variety  in their  beverages.  Our future
success  will  depend,  in part,  upon our  continued  ability  to  develop  and
introduce different and innovative beverages.  In order to retain and expand our
market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative
beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health,  although there
can be no  assurance  of  our  ability  to do so.  There  is no  assurance  that
consumers  will  continue to purchase our products in the future.  Additionally,
many of our  products are  considered  premium  products and to maintain  market
share during  recessionary  periods we may have to reduce  profit  margins which
would adversely  affect our results of operations.  Product  lifecycles for some
beverage  brands and/or  products  and/or packages may be limited to a few years
before consumers'  preferences  change. The beverages we currently market are in
varying  stages of their  lifecycles  and there  can be no  assurance  that such
beverages  will become or remain  profitable  for us. The  beverage  industry is
subject to changing consumer  preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may
adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. We may be unable to achieve
volume growth through product and packaging  initiatives.  We also may be unable
to penetrate  new markets.  If our revenues  decline,  our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.

We rely on bottlers and other contract  packers to manufacture our products.  If
we are unable to maintain  good  relationships  with our  bottlers  and contract
packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes  constrained or
unavailable to us, our business could suffer.

     We do not directly  manufacture  our products,  but instead  outsource such
manufacturing  to bottlers and other contract  packers.  Although our production
arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request,  in
the event of a  disruption  or delay,  we may be unable to  procure  alternative
packing  facilities at commercially  reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably
short time period.  In addition,  there are limited  packing  facilities  in the
United States with adequate  capacity and/or suitable  equipment for many of our
products,  including  Hansen's(R)  brand energy drinks in 8.3-ounce and 16-ounce
cans, Gold Standard line, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce PET plastic
bottles,  Energade(R),  Monster  Energy(R),  Lost(R),  Rumba(TM)  and  Joker Mad
Energy(TM)  energy  drinks  in 8.3,  15.5,  16,  and  24-ounce  cans,  sparkling
lemonades  and  orangeades  and other  products.  There are also limited  shrink
sleeve  labeling  facilities  available to us in the United States with adequate
capacity for our E2O Energy Water(R). A disruption or delay in production of any
of such products could  significantly  affect our revenues from such products as
alternative  co-packing  facilities in the United States with adequate  capacity
may not be available for such products either at commercially  reasonable rates,
and/or  within a  reasonably  short  time  period,  if at all.  Consequently,  a
disruption in production of such products could adversely affect our revenues.

We rely on bottlers and  distributors to distribute our DSD products.  If we are
unable to secure such bottlers and distributors and/or we are unable to maintain
good  relationships  with our existing bottlers and  distributors,  our business
could suffer.

     We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into
agreements  with regional  bottlers or other direct store delivery  distributors
having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.  Many of our
bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture  and/or distribute
other soda and  non-carbonated  brands  and other  beverage  products  including
energy drinks. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products.

     The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If
our DSD  brands  prove  to be  less  attractive  to our  existing  bottlers  and
distributors  and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors,
and/or our bottlers  and/or  distributors do not market and promote our products
above the products of our  competitors,  our business,  financial  condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected.



Our  customers  are material to our success.  If we are unable to maintain  good
relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer.

     Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, and/or convenience
chains, grocery chains,  specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers
to discontinue carrying all or any of the our products that they are carrying at
any time, which could cause our business to suffer.

     One customer  accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the Companys sales
for the years  ended  December  31, 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  A decision by
that, or any other large  customer,  to decrease the amount  purchased  from the
Company or to cease carrying the Companys products could have a material adverse
effect  on  the  Companys  financial  condition  and  consolidated   results  of
operations.

     We  have  exclusive  contracts  with  the  State  of  California  ("State")
Department of Health Services,  Women, Infant and Children ("WIC")  Supplemental
Nutrition  Branch ("DHS") to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice,  in
64-ounce PET plastic bottles. The contracts are each for a period of three years
with a further  one-year  extension option to be mutually agreed between Hansens
and the State of California.  The current contracts expire on July 11, 2007, and
we have no knowledge of whether the contracts will be extended for a further one
year,  or whether we will be successful in securing any new future WIC contracts
with the State. If we are unsuccessful in securing new future WIC contracts with
the State,  our  revenues  from those  products  could be  materially  adversely
affected.

Increases  in cost or  shortages  of raw  materials  or  increases  in  costs of
co-packing could harm our business.

     The  principal  raw  materials  used by us comprise  aluminum  cans,  glass
bottles and PET plastic  bottles as well as juices,  high  fructose  corn syrup,
sucrose and sucralose,  the costs of which are subject to  fluctuations.  Due to
the consolidations that have taken place in the glass industry over the past few
years,  the prices of glass  bottles  continue  to  increase.  The prices of PET
plastic  bottles and aluminum  cans  increased in 2005 and may increase in 2006.
The prices of high fructose corn syrup,  sucrose and certain juice  concentrates
have also  increased  during the year,  particularly  apple  concentrate.  These
increased  costs,  together with increased costs primarily of energy and gas and
freight resulted in increases in certain product costs which are ongoing and are
expected  to  continue  to exert  pressure  on our  gross  margins  in 2006.  In
addition,  certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase
their  charges  based on certain of their own cost  increases.  We are uncertain
whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients
will  continue  to rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of
such increases on to our customers.

     In addition,  some of these raw materials,  such as a sucralose and certain
sizes of cans,  are available  from a limited  number of  suppliers.  Sucralose,
which is used in the Company's  low-calorie  products, is purchased by us from a
single  manufacturer.  The  supplier  of  sucralose  has  notified  us that  our
purchases of sucralose during 2006 will be subject to volume  limitations due to
demand for sucralose exceeding  production  capacity.  While we believe that our
2006 sucralose  volume  allocation will be sufficient to meet the demand for our
products that contain  sucralose,  we may need to  reformulate  certain of those
products that contain  sucralose with alternative  sweetener systems to avoid an
interruption in supply of those products, should the need arise.

     We may not  correctly  estimate  demand for our  products.  Our  ability to
estimate demand for our products is imprecise,  particularly  with new products,
and may be less precise  during  periods of rapid  growth,  particularly  in new
markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to
secure sufficient  ingredients or raw materials  including,  but not limited to,
glass, PET plastic  bottles,  cans,  labels,  sucralose,  flavors,  supplements,
certain  sweeteners,  or packing  arrangements,  we might not be able to satisfy
demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice
concentrates,  supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time
in  the  future,  be  experienced,  which  could  interfere  with  and/or  delay
production of certain of our products and could have a material  adverse  effect
on our business  and  financial  results.  We do not use hedging  agreements  or
alternative instruments to manage this risk.



The costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time
and we may be  unable  to pass  all or some of such  increased  costs  on to our
customers.

     The majority of our  packaging  supplies  contracts  allow our suppliers to
alter the costs they charge us for  packaging  supplies  based on changes in the
costs of the  underlying  commodities  that are used to produce those  packaging
supplies,  such as resin for PET bottles and aluminum for cans. These changes in
the prices we pay for our  packaging  supplies  occur at  certain  predetermined
times  that  vary by  product  and  supplier.  Accordingly,  we bear the risk of
increases in the costs of these  packaging  supplies,  including the  underlying
costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging  supplies.  We do not use
derivative  instruments  to manage  this  risk.  If the cost of these  packaging
supplies  increase,  we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers
through  corresponding  adjustments to the prices we charge,  which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers.  If we are
unable to source our  flavors on  acceptable  terms from our key  suppliers,  we
could suffer disruptions in our business.

     Generally,  flavor suppliers hold the proprietary  rights to their flavors.
Consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors
and certain of our concentrates  readily available to us and we may be unable to
obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice.
Industry-wide   shortages  of  certain  juice   concentrates,   supplements  and
sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced,
which could  interfere with and/or delay  production of certain of our products.
If we  have  to  replace  a  flavor  supplier,  we  could  experience  temporary
disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers which could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our intellectual  property rights are critical to our success,  the loss of such
rights could materially adversely affect our business.

     We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. We also
own the  copyright  in and to portion of the  content  on the  packaging  of our
products.  We  regard  our  trademarks,  copyrights,  and  similar  intellectual
property as critical to our success and attempt to protect  such  property  with
registered and common law trademarks and copyrights,  restrictions on disclosure
and other actions to prevent infringement.  Product packages, mechanical designs
and artwork are  important to our success and we take action to protect  against
imitation of our  packaging  and trade dress and to protect our  trademarks  and
copyrights as  necessary.  However,  there can be no assurance  that other third
parties  will  not  infringe  or  misappropriate   our  trademarks  and  similar
proprietary rights. If we lose some or all of our intellectual  property rights,
our business may be materially adversely affected.

Significant changes in government regulation may hinder sales.

     The production,  distribution  and sale in the United States of many of our
products is subject to the Federal  Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act;  the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational  Safety and Health
Act; various environmental  statutes; and various other federal, state and local
statutes and  regulations  applicable to the production,  transportation,  sale,
safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. New statutes and
regulations  may also be  instituted  in the future.  If a regulatory  authority
finds that a current or future  product or  production  run is not in compliance
with any of these regulations,  we may be fined, or such products may have to be
recalled and/or reformulated and/or packaging changed,  thus adversely affecting
our financial condition and operations.  California law requires that a specific
warning  appear on any product that contains a component  listed by the State as
having been found to cause cancer or birth  defects.  While none of our beverage
products  are  required to display  warnings  under this law, we cannot  predict
whether an  important  component  of any of our  products  might be added to the
California list in the future.  We also are unable to predict whether or to what
extent a warning  under  this law would  have an impact on costs or sales of our
products.



If we are unable to maintain brand image or product quality,  or if we encounter
product recalls, our business may suffer.

     Our success  depends on our  ability to maintain  and build brand image for
our existing products,  new products and brand extensions.  We have no assurance
that our advertising,  marketing and promotional  programs will have the desired
impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. Product quality
issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination,  even if fake
or  unfounded,  could  tarnish  the image of the  affected  brands and may cause
consumers  to choose  other  products.  We may be required  from time to time to
recall  products  entirely  or from  specific  co-packers,  markets or  batches.
Product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. We
do not maintain recall insurance.

     While  we have to date  not  experienced  any  credible  product  liability
litigation, there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in
the future.  In the event we were to experience  product  liability  claims or a
product  recall,  our  financial  condition  and  business  operations  could be
materially adversely effected.

If we are not able to retain the full-time  services of senior management it may
have an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating  performance until
we find suitable replacements.

     Our  business is  dependent,  to a large  extent,  upon the services of our
senior management.  We do not maintain key person life insurance for any members
of our senior management. We currently have employment agreements with Mr. Sacks
and Mr.  Schlosberg  which end on  December  31,  2008.  The loss of services of
either of these persons or any other key members of our senior  management could
adversely affect our business until a suitable  replacements can be found. There
may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these
positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such  qualified  personnel on
acceptable terms.

Weather could adversely affect our supply chain and demand for our products.

     With regard to fruit juice,  fruit juice  concentrates and natural flavors,
the beverage industry is subject to variability of weather conditions, which may
result in higher prices and/or the  nonavailability  of any of such items. Sales
of our products may also be influenced  to some extent by weather  conditions in
the markets in which we operate,  particularly  in areas outside of  California.
Weather  conditions may influence  consumer demand for certain of our beverages,
which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Potential  changes in accounting  practices and/or taxation may adversely affect
our financial results.

     We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or
practices may have on our financial results.  New accounting  standards could be
issued  that  could  change  the way we record  revenues,  expenses,  assets and
liabilities.  These changes in accounting  standards could adversely  affect our
reported  earnings.  Increases  in direct and  indirect  income tax rates  could
affect  after tax  income.  Equally,  increases  in  indirect  taxes  (including
environmental  taxes  pertaining to the disposal of beverage  containers)  could
affect our products' affordability and reduce our sales.

Volatility of Stock Price may restrict sale opportunities.



     Our stock price is affected by a number of factors,  including  stockholder
expectations,  financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our
competitors,  general economic and market conditions,  estimates and projections
by the investment  community and public comments by other persons and many other
factors,  many of which are  beyond  our  control.  We may be unable to  achieve
analysts earnings  forecasts,  which may be based on projected volumes and sales
of many product types and/or new products,  certain of which are more profitable
than others.  There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve  projected
levels or mixes of product  sales.  As a result,  our stock  price is subject to
significant  volatility  and  stockholders  may not be able to sell our stock at
attractive prices.

Provisions in our  organizational  documents and control by insiders may prevent
changes  in  control  even  if  such  changes   would  be  beneficial  to  other
stockholders.

     Our organizational documents may limit changes in control.  Furthermore, at
February  10,  2006,  Mr.  Sacks and Mr.  Schlosberg  together  may be deemed to
control a maximum of 21.2% of our outstanding  common stock.  Consequently,  Mr.
Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg could exercise significant control on matters submitted
to  a  vote  of  our  stockholders,   including  electing  directors,   amending
organizational  documents and  approving  extraordinary  transactions  such as a
takeover attempt,  even though such actions may be favorable to the other common
stockholders.

Our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals.

     We may be unable to  generate  sufficient  cash flow to support our capital
expenditure  plans and general  operating  activities.  In  addition,  the terms
and/or  availability  of  our  credit  facility  and/or  the  activities  of our
creditors could affect the financing of our future growth.

Litigation or legal proceedings  could expose us to significant  liabilities and
thus negatively affect our financial results.

     We are a party,  from time to time, to various  litigation claims and legal
proceedings, which could adversely affect our financial results.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     Our  corporate  offices and main  warehouse  are  located at 1010  Railroad
Street, Corona, California 92882. Our lease for this facility expires in October
2010.  The  area  of  the  facility  is   approximately   141,000  square  feet.
Additionally,  in January 2004 we entered into a lease for additional  warehouse
space in Corona,  California.  The area of this facility is approximately 80,000
square  feet.  This lease will expire at the end of March 2008 with an option to
extend the lease until October 2010. We also rent additional  warehouse space on
a short-term basis from time to time in public  warehouses  situated  throughout
the United States and Canada.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In  September  2004,  Barrington  Capital  Corporation  through  an alleged
successor in interest,  Sandburg Financial  Corporation (both entities with whom
the Company has never had any dealings) served a Notice of Motion  ("Motion") on
the  Company  and  each of its  subsidiaries  as well as on a  number  of  other
unrelated entities and individuals. The Motion seeks to amend a default judgment
granted against a completely unconnected company, Hansen Foods, Inc., to add the
Company  and  its  subsidiary  companies,  as  well as the  other  entities  and
individuals  cited,  as judgment  debtors.  The default  judgment was entered on
February 15, 1996, for $7,626,000 plus legal interest and attorneys' fees in the
sum of  $211,000  arising  out of a breach  of  contract  claim  that  allegedly
occurred  in the  1980s.  Barrington  Capital  Corporation's/Sandburg  Financial
Corporations claim is based on the misconceived and unsubstantiated  theory that
the Company and its  subsidiaries  are alter egos  and/or  successors  of Hansen
Foods,  Inc. The Motion is based on demonstrably  false  allegations,  misstated
legal propositions and lacks any substantial  supporting  evidence.  The Company
and its  subsidiaries  are  vigorously  opposing the Motion and believe that the
Motion is without any merit.



     In June 2005,  the Company  filed a complaint in  California  federal court
against North American  Beverage Company ("NAB") seeking an injunction,  damages
and other relief  arising out of NAB's  infringement  of the  Company's  Monster
Energy(R)  marks through the promotion and  advertising of carbonated  beverages
under the mark  "Flathead  Lake Monster" with the word  "Monster"  predominantly
displayed.  In response, in July 2005, Flathead Lake Monster, Inc. ("Flathead"),
a Montana  corporation which allegedly licensed the mark "Flathead Lake Monster"
to NAB,  filed a complaint  against  the Company in federal  court in Montana in
which it alleged that it is the licensor of the mark "Flathead Lake Monster" and
sought a  declaration  that its use of that mark for soda does not  infringe the
Company's rights in its "Monster Energy" marks. Flathead's complaint also in the
alternative claimed trademark infringement by the Company "to the extent a court
finds a  likelihood  of  confusion"  between  the  parties  marks and  sought an
injunction against the Company from using the term "Monster Energy",  as well as
damages and other relief.  In December 2005,  all of the aforesaid  proceedings,
including the complaint  filed by the Company as well as the complaint  filed by
Flathead Lake, were settled on terms deemed to be favorable to the Company.

     Furthermore,  we are subject to litigation  from time to time in the normal
course of  business.  Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of such
litigation,  based on the facts known to us and after consultation with counsel,
we believe that such litigation  will not have a material  adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

     Except as described above,  there are no material pending legal proceedings
to  which  we or any of our  subsidiaries  is a  party  or to  which  any of our
properties is subject,  other than ordinary and routine litigation incidental to
our business.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

     The consolidated statements of operations data set forth below with respect
to each of the years ended  December 31, 2001 through 2005 and the balance sheet
data as of December  31, for the years  indicated,  are derived from our audited
consolidated  financial  statements and should be read in conjunction with those
financial statements and notes thereto, and with the Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations included as ITEM 7 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.






* Gross  sales,  although  used  internally  by  management  as an  indicator of
operating performance,  should not be considered as an alternative to net sales,
which is determined in accordance  with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an
indicator of operating  performance in place of net sales.  Additionally,  gross
sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies
as  gross  sales  has  been  defined  by  the   Company's   internal   reporting
requirements.  However,  gross sales is used by management to monitor  operating
performance  including  sales  performance of particular  products,  salesperson
performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use
of gross sales allows evaluation of sales  performance  before the effect of any
promotional  items,  which  can  mask  certain  performance  issues.  Management
believes  the   presentation   of  gross  sales  allows  a  more   comprehensive
presentation  of the  Companys  operating  performance.  Gross  sales may not be
realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional  payment and allowances may
be  deducted  from  payments  received  from  customers.(  See "PART II ITEM 7 -
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS").


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion ("MD&A") is provided as a supplement to and should

("Notes")  included  elsewhere  in this  Form  10-K.  This  discussion  contains
forward-looking  statements that are based on management's current expectations,
estimates and projections about our business and operations.  Our actual results
may differ  materially  from those  currently  anticipated and expressed in such
forwardlooking statements.

     This overview provides our perspective on the individual  sections of MD&A.
MD&A includes the following sections:

*    Our Business - a general description of our business;  the value drivers of
     our business; and opportunities and risks;

*    Results  of  Operations  - an  analysis  of  our  consolidated  results  of
     operations for the three years presented in our financial statements;

Our Business

Overview

     We  develop,  market,  sell and  distribute,  in the main,  a wide range of
branded  beverages.  The  majority  of our  beverages  fall  within the  growing
"alternative"  beverage  category.  The  principal  brand  names under which our
beverages are marketed are Hansen's(R),  Monster Energy(R),  Blue Sky(R), Junior
Juice(R),  Lost(R),  Rumba(TM)  and  Joker  Mad  Energy(TM).  We own  all of our
above-listed brand names other than Lost(R) which we produce,  market,  sell and
distribute under an exclusive licensing arrangement with Lost International LLC.

     Our  company  principally  generates  revenues,  income  and cash  flows by
developing,  producing,  marketing,  selling and distributing  finished beverage
products. We generally sell these products to retailers as well as distributors.

     We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands including
advertising  costs,  athlete and event sponsorship fees and special  promotional
events.  We focus on developing  brand awareness and trial through sampling both
in stores and at events. Retailers and distributors receive rebates, promotions,
point of sale materials,  merchandise displays and coolers. We also use in-store
promotions and in-store  placement of point-of-sale  materials and racks,  prize
promotions, price promotions, competitions, and sponsorship of, and endorsements
from selected  public and extreme sports figures,  events and causes.  Consumers
receive  coupons,   discounts  and  promotional   incentives.   These  marketing
expenditures  help to enhance  distribution  and availability of our products as
well as  awareness  and increase  consumer  preference  for our brands.  Greater
distribution  and  availability,  awareness  and  preference  promotes long term
growth.

     During 2005, we continued to expand our existing  product lines and further
develop our  markets.  In  particular,  we continue to focus on  developing  and
marketing  beverages  that fall within the category  generally  described as the
"alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks.

     We  believe  that one of the keys to success in the  beverage  industry  is
differentiation  such as making Hansen's(R)  products visually  distinctive from
other  beverages  on the  shelves  of  retailers.  We review  our  products  and
packaging  on an  ongoing  basis and,  where  practical,  endeavor  to make them
different,  better and unique.  The labels and graphics for many of our products
are   redesigned   from  time  to  time  to  maximize   their   visibility   and
identification,  wherever  they may be placed in stores and we will  continue to
reevaluate the same from time to time.

     A  substantial  portion  of our sales are  derived  from  "energy  drinks",
particularly our Monster Energy(R) brand energy drinks. Any decrease in sales of
our energy drinks,  particularly our Monster Energy(R) brand energy drinks could
significantly  adversely affect our future revenues and net income.  Competitive
pressure in the "energy  drink"  category could  adversely  affect our operating
results. (See "PART I ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS")



     We again achieved record sales in 2005. The increase in gross and net sales
in 2005 was primarily  attributable  to increased sales by volume of our Monster
Energy(R)  drinks,  which  were  introduced  in April  2002,  including  our low
carbohydrate  ("lo-carb")  Monster  Energy(R)  drinks,  which were introduced in
2003, our Monster Energy(R)  Assault(TM)  energy drinks which were introduced in
September 2004, sales of Monster Energy(R)  Khaos(TM) energy drinks,  which were
introduced in August 2005,  increased  sales by volume of Lost(R)  energy drinks
which were introduced in January 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker
Mad  Energy(TM)  drinks  which  were  introduced  in  January  2005,  as well as
increased  sales  by  volume  of  apple  juice  and  juice  blends,   children's
multi-vitamin  juice drinks and Rumba(TM) energy juice,  which was introduced in
December  2004.  The  increase  in gross and net sales was  partially  offset by
decreased sales by volume  primarily of Hansen's(R)  natural sodas,  Hansen's(R)
energy drinks, Energade(R), and Smoothies in cans.

     During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005,  sales  shipped  outside  of
California  represented  62% of our aggregate gross sales, as compared to 56% of
our aggregate  gross sales for the  comparable  period in 2004.  During the year
ended  December  31,  2005,  sales to  distributors  outside  the United  States
amounted  to $5.6  million,  as  compared  to $2.3  million  for the year  ended
December  31,  2004,  which  was less  than 2% of gross  sales  for each  period
respectively.

     Our  customers  are  typically   retail   grocery  and  specialty   chains,
wholesalers,  club stores,  drug, mass  merchandisers,  convenience chains, full
service  beverage  distributors,  health  food  distributors  and  food  service
customers. Sales to our various customer types for 2005 are reflected below. The
allocations  below  reflect  changes  made  by the  Company  to  the  categories
historically reported.

  Retail Grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers                           19%
  Club stores, drug & mass merchandisers                                     11%
  Full service distributors                                                  65%
  Health food distributors                                                    3%
  Other                                                                       2%

     In 2004, we introduced a carbonated  Lost(R) Energy drink in 16-ounce cans,
a carbonated Monster Energy(R) Assault(TM) drink in 16-ounce cans, a new line of
Blue Sky(R)  natural tea sodas in 12-ounce  cans,  Hansen's(R)  energy drinks in
16-ounce cans,  Rumba(TM)  Energy Juice in 15.5-once cans and also  introduced a
new line of lo-carb smoothies in 11.5-ounce cans.

     In 2005, we introduced a carbonated  Joker Mad Energy(TM) drink in 16-ounce
cans (regular and lo-carb) a carbonated Monster Energy(R) Khaos(TM) energy drink
in 16-ounce cans,  Monster  Energy(R) and Lo-Carb Monster Energy(R) in 24-ounce
cans,  Monster  Energy(R),  Lo-Carb  Monster  Energy(R)  and  Monster  Energy(R)
Assault(TM)  drinks in 8.3-ounce  cans, a new line of Blue Sky(R) natural sodas
with real sugar,  a new line of lite Blue Sky(R) natural sodas in 12-ounce cans,
a new line of non-carbonated  Blue Sky(R) isotonic sports drinks in 16-ounce PET
plastic bottles, as well as new juice products and Fizzit(TM) which is a line of
vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form.

     Sales of our dual-branded  100% juice line named Juice Blast(R),  which was
launched in conjunction with Costco and is sold through Costco stores, were $4.0
million in 2005 as compared to $2.0 million in 2004.  We have and will  continue
to  introduce  new  flavors  from time to time in an  effort to ensure  that the
variety  pack  remains  fresh and  different  for  consumers  and  retain and if
possible increase current distribution levels.



     In  September  2000,  HBC,  through its wholly owned  subsidiary  Blue Sky,
acquired the Blue Sky(R)  natural soda  business.  The Blue Sky(R)  natural soda
brand is the leading  natural  soda in the health  food  trade.  Blue Sky offers
natural sodas,  premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and
anti-oxidant  vitamins,  organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a
Blue Energy(R) drink in 8.3-ounce cans and in 2004 introduced a new line of Blue
Sky(R)  natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans. In 2005, we introduced a new line of
Blue Sky Lite natural  sodas,  a new line of Blue Sky(R) natural sodas made with
real sugar and a new line of non-carbonated Blue Sky(R) isotonic sports drinks.

     In May 2001,  HBC,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Junior  Juice,
acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business. The Junior Juice(R) product line
is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce  aseptic packages and
is targeted at toddlers.

     During 2005, we entered into several new  distribution  agreements  for the
sale of our products both within and outside the United States and substantially
expanded our national sales force and marketing and support staff.  As discussed
under "PART I ITEM 1. - BUSINESS  MANUFACTURE AND  DISTRIBUTION",  we anticipate
that we will continue  building our national  sales force in 2006 as well as our
marketing and support staff to support and grow the sales of our products.

     In 2002,  we  introduced a Sparkling  Cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5-liter
Magnum glass bottle. However, due to limited reports of some bottles breaking in
2003,  we promptly  recalled the product.  We are pursuing a claim for the costs
and losses  incurred by us. We will  reevaluate  relaunching  this  product once
certain  production  issues  are  resolved  to our  satisfaction  and a suitable
co-packer has been identified.

     During 2004, we concluded exclusive contracts with the State of California,
Department of Health Services Women, Infant and Children Supplemental  Nutrition
Branch,  to supply  100% Apple  juice and 100%  blended  juice in  64-ounce  PET
plastic bottles.  The contracts commenced on July 12, 2004. (See "PART I ITEM 1.
BUSINESS MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION").

     We continue to incur  expenditures  in connection  with the development and
introduction of new products and flavors.

      Value Drivers of our Business

          We believe  that the key value  drivers of our  business  include  the
     following:

     *    Profitable Growth - We believe natural, better for you brands properly
          supported by marketing and  innovation,  targeted to a broad  consumer
          base-drive  profitable  growth.  We  continue to broaden our family of
          brands.  In  particular,  we are  expanding  and growing our specialty
          beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers.
          We are focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. We believe
          that  tailored  brand,  package,  price and  channel  strategies  help
          achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a
          view to accelerating profitable growth.

     *    Cost Management - The principal focus of cost management will continue
          to be on  supplies  and cost  reduction.  One key area of  focus,  for
          example,  is to  decrease  raw  material  costs,  co-packing  fees and
          general and  administrative  costs as a  percentage  of net  operating
          revenues.  Another  key area of focus is the  reduction  in  inventory
          levels. However, due to the expansion in the number of our products as
          well as  increased  sales  levels in 2005,  overall  inventory  levels
          increased. During 2005, the costs primarily of PET plastic bottles and
          aluminum  cans,  as well as the costs of high  fructose corn syrup and
          sucrose and certain packaging and freight costs also increased.



     *    Efficient  Capital  Structure - Our capital  structure  is intended to
          optimize our costs of capital. We believe our strong capital position,
          our ability to raise funds at low effective cost and overall low costs
          of borrowing provide a competitive advantage.

     We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials
being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented,  will result in
(1)  maintaining  and/or  improving  our  gross  profit  margin;  (2)  providing
additional  leverage over time through  reduced  expenses as a percentage of net
operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure
of  success  is and will be  reflected  in our  current  and  future  results of
operations.

     Gross and net operating revenues, gross profits,  operating income, and net
income and net income per share  represent key  measurements  of the above value
drivers.  In 2005,  gross operating  revenues  totaled $415.4 million,  an 85.4%
increase over 2004. Net operating  revenues totaled $348.9 million,  an increase
of 93.5%  over 2004.  Gross  profit  totaled  $182.5  million in 2005,  a 118.7%
increase  from  2004.  Operating  income was $103.4  million  compared  to $33.9
million for 2004.  Net income was $62.8 million as compared to $20.4 million for
2004.  Net  income per  diluted  share was $2.59 as  compared  to net income per
diluted  share of $.86 in 2004.  These  measurements  will  continue to be a key
management  focus in 2006 and beyond.  See also "Results of  Operations  for the
Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004."

     In 2005,  the  Company had working  capital of $107.1  million  compared to
$41.6  million as of  December  31,  2004.  In 2005,  our net cash  provided  by
operating  activities  was  approximately  $54.6  million as  compared  to $20.1
million  in 2004.  Principal  uses of cash  flows are  purchases  of  inventory,
increases in accounts  receivable and other assets,  acquisition of property and
equipment and  trademarks.  Payment of our debt and accounts  payable and income
taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal  recurring use of cash
and working  capital  funds.  (See also "PART II ITEM 7. - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES").

      Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

     Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks
that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company.  Increase in
consumer and regulatory  awareness of the health  problems  arising from obesity
and inactive lifestyles  represents a challenge.  We recognize that obesity is a
complex and serious public health  problem.  Our commitment to consumers  begins
with our broad  product  line and a wide  selection  of diet,  light and lo-carb
beverages,  juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks.
We  continuously  strive  to  meet  changing  consumer  needs  through  beverage
innovation, choice and variety.

     Our historical  success is  attributable,  in part, to our  introduction of
different and innovative  beverages.  Our future  success will depend,  in part,
upon our  continued  ability to develop and introduce  different and  innovative
beverages,  although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order
to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce
different and  innovative  beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality,
health,   method  of  distribution,   brand  image  and  intellectual   property
protection.  The beverage industry is subject to changing  consumer  preferences
and shifts in consumer  preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge
such preferences.



     In addition,  other key challenges and risks that could impact our companys
future financial results include, but are not limited to:

*    maintenance of our brand images and product quality;

*    profitable  expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive
     market place (See also "PART I ITEM 1. - BUSINESS -  COMPETITION  and SALES
     AND MARKETING");

*    restrictions on imports and sources of supply;  duties or tariffs;  changes
     in government regulations;

*    protection of our existing  intellectual  property  portfolio of trademarks
     and  the  continuous  pursuit  of new  and  innovative  trademarks  for our
     expanding product lines;

*    limitations on available quantities of sucralose,  a non-caloric  sweetener
     that is used in many of our beverage  products,  during 2006, due to demand
     for such sweetener exceeding the supplier's production capacity, as well as
     limitations on available  quantities of certain package  containers such as
     the 24-ounce cap can and copacking availability; and

*    the imposition of additional restrictions.

*    (See also  "PART I ITEM 1A. - RISK  FACTORS")  for  additional  information
     about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.

We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:

*    growth potential for  non-alcoholic  beverage  categories  including energy
     drinks,  carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and
     water;

*    new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits;

*    premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth;

*    significant  package,   pricing  and  channel   opportunities  to  maximize
     profitable growth; and

*    proper positioning to capture industry growth.



Results of Operations


* Gross  sales,  although  used  internally  by  management  as an  indicator of
operating performance,  should not be considered as an alternative to net sales,
which is determined in accordance  with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an
indicator of operating  performance in place of net sales.  Additionally,  gross
sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies
as  gross  sales  has  been  defined  by  the   Company's   internal   reporting
requirements.  However,  gross sales is used by management to monitor  operating
performance  including  sales  performance of particular  products,  salesperson
performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use
of gross sales allows evaluation of sales  performance  before the effect of any
promotional  items,  which  can  mask  certain  performance  issues.  Management
believes  the   presentation   of  gross  sales  allows  a  more   comprehensive
presentation  of the  Companys  operating  performance.  Gross  sales may not be
realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional  payment and allowances may
be deducted from payments received from customers.



** Although  the  expenditures  described  in this line item are  determined  in
accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not
conform with GAAP presentation requirements.  Additionally,  the presentation of
promotional  and  other  allowances  may  not be  comparable  to  similar  items
presented  by  other  companies.  The  presentation  of  promotional  and  other
allowances  facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination
of net sales and  illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales.
Promotional and other allowances  constitute a material portion of the marketing
activities of the Company.

Results of Operations  for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year
Ended December 31, 2004

     Gross Sales.  For the year ended December 31, 2005, gross sales were $415.4
million,  an  increase  of $191.3  million or 85.4%  higher  than gross sales of
$224.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in gross sales
is primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products
and the  introduction  of new  products as discussed  below in "Net Sales".  The
percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net
sales due to a decrease in the promotional and other  allowances as a percentage
of gross sales,  which decreased from 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004
to 16.0% for the year ended  December  31, 2005,  although the actual  amount of
promotional and other  allowances  increased from $43.8 million to $66.5 million
for the respective periods.

     Net Sales.  For the year ended  December 31,  2005,  net sales were $ 348.9
million,  an increase of $168.5 million or 93.5% higher than net sales of $180.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We again achieved  record sales in
2005. The increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily  attributable to
increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy(R) drinks, which were introduced
in April 2002,  including our low  carbohydrate  ("lo-carb")  Monster  Energy(R)
drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our Monster Energy(R)  Assault(TM) energy
drinks which were  introduced  in  September  2004,  sales of Monster  Energy(R)
Khaos(TM) energy drinks,  which were introduced in August 2005,  increased sales
by volume of Lost(R) energy drinks which were introduced in January 2004, and to
a lesser extent,  to sales of Joker Mad Energy(TM)  drinks which were introduced
in January 2005,  as well as increased  sales by volume of apple juice and juice
blends,  and  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks and  Rumba(TM)  which was
introduced in December  2004.  The increase in gross and net sales was partially
offset by  decreased  sales by volume  primarily of Hansen's  Natural  Sodas(R),
Hansen's(R)  energy  drinks,  Energade(R)  and Smoothies in cans. Net sales case
volumes  (calculated  on 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished  beverage  equivalent
basis) increased from 29.8 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2004 to
48.2 million  cases for the year ended  December  31, 2005,  an increase of 18.4
million  cases or 62.0%.  The  overall  average  net  sales  price per case also
increased to $7.24 per case for the year ended  December 31, 2005 from $6.06 for
the year ended  December  31,  2004,  an increase of 19.5%.  The increase in the
average net sales  prices per case was due to an increase in the  proportion  of
case sales derived from higher priced products as described below.

     Net  sales for the DSD  segment  were  $270.0  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately  $157.0 million or 138.8% higher
than net sales of $113.1  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2004.  The
increase  in net  sales  for the  DSD  segment  was  primarily  attributable  to
increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy(R) drinks, which were introduced
in April 2002,  including our low  carbohydrate  ("lo-carb")  Monster  Energy(R)
drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our Monster Energy(R)  Assault(TM) energy
drinks which were  introduced  in  September  2004,  sales of Monster  Energy(R)
Khaos(TM) energy drinks,  which were introduced in August 2005,  increased sales
by volume of Lost energy  drinks  which were  introduced  in January  2004.  The
increase in net sales was also  attributable,  to a lesser  extent,  to sales of
Joker Mad Energy(TM)  drinks which were introduced in January 2005. The increase
in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of Hansen's(R) energy
drinks and Energade(R).

     Net sales for the  Warehouse  segment were $78.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005,  an increase of  approximately  $11.3 million or 16.7% higher
than net sales of $67.6  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2004.  The
increase in net sales for the Warehouse  segment was primarily  attributable  to
increased  sales  by  volume  of  Hansen's(R)  apple  juice  and  juice  blends,
children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks and  RumbaTM  energy  juice,  which was
introduced in December 2004.  The increase in net sales was partially  offset by
lower sales by volume of smoothies in cans and Hansen's(R) natural sodas.



     Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $182.5  million for the year ended December
31, 2005,  an increase of $99.1  million or 118.7% over the $83.5  million gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales was 52.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which was higher than gross
profit as a  percentage  of net sales of 46.3% for the year ended  December  31,
2004,  due  primarily to higher gross profit  margins  achieved on the increased
sales of  Monster  Energy(R)  and  Lost(R)  energy  drinks.  Although  a greater
percentage of our sales comprised  products having higher gross margins than the
prior year,  the  increase in profit  margins  was  partially  reduced by higher
promotional payments and allowances to promote our products.

     Gross profit may not be  comparable to those of other  entities  since some
entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of
sales whereas  others like Hansen's  exclude  certain costs and instead  include
such costs within another line item such as selling,  general and administrative
expenses.

     Distribution  expenses,  which include  out-bound  freight and  warehousing
expenses after  manufacture,  were $22.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2005 and  $12.4  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 and have been
included in operating expenses.

     Total Operating  Expenses.  Total operating expenses were $79.1 million for
the year ended  December  31, 2005,  an increase of $29.5  million or 59.6% over
total operating  expenses of $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 22.6% for the
year ended December 31, 2005, from 27.4% for the year ended December31,2004. The
increase in total  operating  expenses was primarily  attributable  to increased
selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  The decrease in total operating
expenses  as a  percentage  of  net  sales  was  primarily  attributable  to the
comparatively  lower increase in selling,  general and  administrative  expenses
than the increase in net sales.

     Selling.  Selling  expenses were $50.8 million for the year ended  December
31, 2005, an increase of $21.5  million or 73.7% over selling  expenses of $29.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  Selling  expenses as a percentage
of net sales  decreased to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 16.2%
for the year ended  December  31,  2004.  The  increase in selling  expenses was
primarily  attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses
which increased by $9.7 million,  increased  expenditures for trade  development
activities and  cooperative  arrangements  with our customers and  distributors,
which  increased  by  $4.2  million,   increased  expenditures  for  merchandise
displays,  point-of-sale  materials,  and  premiums,  which  increased  by  $3.0
million,   increased   expenditures  for  sponsorships  and  endorsements  which
increased $1.7 million,  increased  expenditures for advertising which increased
by $1.3 million, and increased expenditures for samples, which increased by $1.2
million.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses were $28.3
million for the year ended  December  31,  2005,  an increase of $8.0 million or
39.4% over  general and  administrative  expenses of $20.3  million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. General and administrative  expenses as a percentage of
net sales  decreased to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 11.3% for
the year ended  December  31, 2004.  The increase in general and  administrative
expenses was primarily  attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.6
million,  distributor  termination  payments which increased by $1.2 million and
travel and entertainment expenses which increased by $682,000.

     Amortization of Trademarks.  Amortization of trademarks was $70,000 for the
year  ended  December  31,  2005,  a decrease  of $3,000  from  amortization  of
trademarks  of $73,000 for the year ended  December  31,  2004.  The decrease in
amortization  of  trademarks  was due to a reduction  in the balance of definite
life trademarks.



     Contribution  Margin.  Contribution  margin represents net sales by segment
less the cost of sales and operating  expenses which can be directly  attributed
to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $112.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $71.8 million
or 174.4%  higher than  contribution  margin of $41.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase in  contribution  margin for the DSD segment was
primarily  attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster  Energy(R) brand
energy drinks and Lost(R) energy drinks.  Contribution  margin for the Warehouse
segment was $6.4 million for the year ended  December  31, 2005,  an increase of
approximately  $2.4  million or 58.5%  higher than  contribution  margin of $4.0
million for year ended  December  31,  2004.  The  increase in the  contribution
margin for the Warehouse  segment was primarily  attributable to increased sales
of apple juice and juice blends.

     Operating  Income.  Operating  income was $103.4 million for the year ended
December 31,  2005,  compared to $33.9  million for the year ended  December 31,
2004. The $69.6 million increase in operating income was primarily  attributable
to increased gross profits,  which was partially  offset by increased  operating
expenses.

     Net Nonoperating  Income/(Expense).  Net nonoperating  income/(expense) was
$1.4  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005,  as  compared  to net
nonoperating  income/(expense)  of $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Net nonoperating  income/(expense)  consists of interest income and interest and
financing expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to
an increase in the cash balances in interest  bearing  accounts  during the year
ended  December 31, 2005.  Interest  income for the year ended December 31, 2005
was $1.4  million  compared  to  interest  income of $94,000  for the year ended
December 31, 2004.  Interest and financing  expense for the year ended  December
31, 2005 was $77,000  compared to $42,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2004.
The increase in interest and financing expense was primarily  attributable to an
increase in capital leases entered into during 2005.

     Provision for Income  Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2005 was $42.0  million  which was an increase of $28.4  million as
compared to the  provision  for income taxes of $13.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.  The  increase in  provision  for income taxes was  primarily
attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal
and state tax rate for 2005 was 40.1%,  as compared to an effective  tax rate of
39.9% for 2004.

     Net Income.  Net income was $62.8  million for the year ended  December 31,
2005,  which was an increase of $42.4 million as compared to net income of $20.4
million for the year ended  December  31,  2004.  The increase in net income was
primarily  attributable  to the $99.1  million  increase in gross  profit and an
increase of net nonoperating income/(expense) of $1.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005 which was partially offset by increased  operating expenses of
$29.5  million  and an  increase  in the  provision  for  income  taxes of $28.4
million.

     Results of Operations  for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the
Year Ended December 31, 2003

     Gross Sales.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, gross sales were $224.1
million,  an increase of approximately  $88.4 million or 65.2% higher than gross
sales of $135.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 2003.  The increase in
gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily  attributable  to
increased  sales by volume of certain of our  existing  products  as well as the
introduction of new products as discussed  below in "Net Sales".  The percentage
increase in gross sales was comparable to the percentage  increase in net sales.
The  promotional  and other  allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased
slightly  from 18.7% for the year ended  December 31, 2003 to 19.5% for the year
ended  December 31, 2004 as well as the actual amount of  promotional  and other
allowances,  which  increased  from  $25.3  million  to  $43.8  million  for the
respective periods.



     Net Sales.  For the year ended  December  31,  2004,  net sales were $180.3
million,  an increase of  approximately  $70.0  million or 63.4% higher than net
sales of $110.4  million for the year ended  December 31, 2003.  The increase in
gross and net sales in 2004 was  primarily  attributable  to increased  sales by
volume of Monster Energy(R) drink, which was introduced in April 2002, including
our low carbohydrate ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(R) drink which was introduced in
2003 and sales by volume of Lost  energy  drinks  which were  introduced  at the
beginning of 2004,  as well as increased  sales by volume of apple juice,  juice
blends,  and  Energade(R)  energy sports drinks.  Additionally,  the increase in
gross  and net sales  was  attributable  to the  increased  sales  prices of and
reduced  allowances  for  smoothies in cans and natural  sodas.  The increase in
gross and net sales was partially  offset by decreased sales by volume primarily
of Hansen's(R) energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans,  childrens  multi-vitamin  juice
drinks, and teas, lemonades and cocktails. Net sales case volumes increased from
20.4 million  cases for the year ended  December 31, 2003 to 29.8 million  cases
for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 9.3 million cases or 45.7%.
The overall  average net sales price per case also  increased  to $6.06 per case
for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 from  $5.40 per case for the year ended
December 31, 2003,  an increase of 12.2%.  The increase in the average net sales
prices per case was due to an increase in the  proportion  of case sales derived
from higher priced products.

     Net  sales for the DSD  segment  were  $113.1  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2004, an increase of  approximately  $63.6 million or 128.5% higher
than net sales of $49.5  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2003.  The
increase  in net  sales  for the  DSD  segment  was  primarily  attributable  to
increased sales by volume of Monster  Energy(R)  drink,  which was introduced in
April 2002,  including our low carbohydrate  ("lo-carb") Monster Energy(R) drink
which was  introduced in 2003 and sales by volume of Lost(R) energy drinks which
were  introduced at the beginning of 2004, as well as increased  sales by volume
of  Energade(R)  energy  sports  drinks.  The  increase in net sales for the DSD
segment  was  partially  offset  by  decreased  sales  by  volume  primarily  of
Hansen's(R) energy drinks.

     Net sales for the  Warehouse  segment were $67.6 million for the year ended
December 31,  2004,  an increase of  approximately  $6.7 million or 11.0% higher
than net sales of $60.9  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2003.  The
increase in net sales of the  Warehouse  segment was primarily  attributable  to
increased  sales  by  volume  of  Hansen's(R)  apple  juice  and  juice  blends.
Additionally,   the  increase  in  net  sales  for  the  Warehouse  segment  was
attributable  to the  increased  sales  prices  of and  reduced  allowances  for
smoothies in cans and natural  sodas.  The  increase in net sales was  partially
offset by decreased  sales by volume  primarily of our  childrens  multi-vitamin
juice drinks, and teas, lemonades and cocktails.

     Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $83.5  million for the year ended  December
31, 2004,  an increase of $39.7  million or 90.7% over the $43.8  million  gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2003. Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales was 46.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004 which was higher than gross
profit as a  percentage  of net sales of 39.7% for the year ended  December  31,
2003. Increases in gross sales volume contributed to an increase in gross profit
while a change in the Companys product and customer mix and the related increase
in the percentage of sales of higher margin products increased both gross profit
and gross profit as a percentage of net sales.  This increase in profit  margins
was partially reduced by higher  promotional  payments and allowances to promote
our products.

     Gross profit may not be  comparable to those of other  entities  since some
entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of
sales whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within
another line item such as selling, general and administrative expenses.

     Distribution  expenses,  which include  out-bound  freight and  warehousing
expenses  after  manufacture,  were $12.4 million and $8.3 million for the years
ended  December  31,  2004 and  2003,  respectively  and have been  included  in
operating expenses.



     Total Operating  Expenses.  Total operating expenses were $49.6 million for
the year ended  December  31, 2004,  an increase of $15.6  million or 46.0% over
total operating  expenses of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Total  operating  expenses as a percentage  of net sales  decreased  slightly to
27.5% for the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  from  30.8% for the year  ended
December  31,  2003.  The increase in total  operating  expenses  was  primarily
attributable to increased  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses.  The
decrease in total operating  expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily
attributable  to the  comparatively  lower  increase  in  selling,  general  and
administrative expenses than the increase in net sales.

     Selling.  Selling  expenses were $29.2 million for the year ended  December
31, 2004,  an increase of $9.1  million or 45.5% over selling  expenses of $20.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2003.  Selling  expenses as a percentage
of net sales  decreased to 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 18.2%
for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  The  increase in selling  expenses was
primarily  attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses
after manufacture,  which increased by $4.1 million,  increased expenditures for
trade development activities and cooperative arrangements with our customers and
distributors,  which increased by $2.1 million,  and increased  expenditures for
merchandise displays,  point-of-sale materials, and premiums, which increased by
$2.0 million

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses were $20.3
million for the year ended  December  31,  2004,  an increase of $6.5 million or
47.0% over  general and  administrative  expenses of $13.8  million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. General and administrative  expenses as a percentage of
net sales decreased to 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 12.5% for
the year ended  December  31, 2003.  The increase in general and  administrative
expenses was primarily  attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.3
million,  professional services,  consisting of legal, consulting and accounting
services  primarily  related to the  implementation  and testing required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and legal services related to protecting  trademarks
which  increased by $1.5 million,  and travel and  entertainment  expenses which
increased by $622,000.

     Contribution  Margin.  Contribution  margin for the DSD  segment  was $41.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $26.3
million or 176.6% higher than contribution  margin of $14.9 million for the year
ended  December  31,  2003.  The  increase  in  contribution  margin for the DSD
division  was  primarily  attributable  to the  increase in net sales of Monster
Energy(R) brand energy drinks and Lost(R) energy drinks. Contribution margin for
the Warehouse  segment was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an
increase of approximately $1.6 million or 66.7% higher than contribution  margin
of  $2.4  million  for  year  ended  December  31,  2003.  The  increase  in the
contribution  margin for the  Warehouse  segment was primarily  attributable  to
increased sales of Hansen's(R) apple juice and juice blends.

     Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark
license and  trademarks  was $73,000 for the year ended  December 31,  2004,  an
increase of $11,000 over  amortization  of trademark  license and  trademarks of
$62,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2003. The increase in  amortization  of
trademark license and trademarks was due to the acquisition of trademarks during
the year ended December 31, 2004.

     Operating  Income.  Operating  income was $33.9  million for the year ended
December  31,  2004,  compared to $9.8  million for the year ended  December 31,
2003,  an increase  of $24.1  million.  The  increase  in  operating  income and
operating  income as a percentage of net sales was  attributable to higher gross
profit as well as gross profit  increasing at a higher rate than the increase in
operating  expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2003.

     Net Nonoperating Income/(Expense).  Net nonoperating income was $52,000 for
the year ended  December 31, 2004,  as compared to net  nonoperating  expense of
$67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net nonoperating  income/(expense)
consists of interest income and interest and financing expense.  The increase in
interest  income was primarily  attributable to an increase in the cash invested
in interest bearing  accounts during the year ended December 31, 2004.  Interest
and financing  expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $42,000 compared
to $73,000 for the year ended  December 31,  2003.  The decrease in interest and
financing expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in outstanding loan
balances and lower interest  rates.  Interest income for the year ended December
31, 2004 was $94,000,  compared to interest  income of $6,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2003.



     Provision for Income  Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December  31, 2004 was $13.6  million  which was an increase of $9.7  million as
compared to the  provision  for income  taxes of $3.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.  The  increase in  provision  for income taxes was  primarily
attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal
and state tax rate for 2004 was 39.9%,  which was higher than the  effective tax
rate of 39.2% for 2003 due to the increase in the statutory  federal  income tax
rate applicable to the Company's pre-tax income.

     Net Income.  Net income was $20.4  million for the year ended  December 31,
2004,  which was an increase of $14.5  million as compared to net income of $5.9
million for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  The increase in net income was
primarily  attributable  to the  $39.7  million  increase  in gross  profit  and
decrease in nonoperating expense and increase in nonoperating income of $119,000
for the year ended  December  31, 2004 which was  partially  offset by increased
operating  expenses of $15.6 million and an increase in the provision for income
taxes of $9.7 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Cash flows from  operating  activities  - Net cash  provided  by  operating
activities was $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to
$20.1 million in the comparable  period in 2004. For the year ended December 31,
2005,  cash provided by operating  activities was primarily  attributable to net
income earned including adjustments for certain non-cash expenses. In 2005, cash
provided  by  operating  activities  was reduced  due to  increases  in accounts
receivable  which  was  attributable  to  increased  sales  volumes  as  well as
increased  sales to certain  classes of  customers  who have  different  payment
terms,  increases in inventories required to meet increased sales levels and the
increases in prepaid income taxes.  Increases in inventory levels are the direct
result of increases in purchasing,  which contributed to the increased  balances
of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

     Purchases  of  inventories,  increases  in  accounts  receivable  and other
assets,  acquisition  of property  and  equipment,  acquisition  of  trademarks,
payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our
principal recurring use of cash.

     Cash flows from  investing  activities  - Net cash  provided  by  investing
activities  was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to
net cash used in investing  activities of $18.8 million in the comparable period
in 2004.  For the year ended  December  31,  2005,  cash  provided by  investing
activities  was primarily  attributable  to purchases,  maturities  and sales of
short-term  investments,  and to a minor extent,  the  sale-leaseback of certain
vans and  promotional  vehicles and the sale of certain  property and  equipment
that  was no  longer  operational.  For both  periods,  cash  used in  investing
activities  included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of computer and
office  equipment  used  for  sales  and  administrative  activities,  vans  and
promotional   vehicles  and  other   equipment  to  support  the  marketing  and
promotional  activities  of the Company  and also for  additions  to  trademark.
Management expects that it will continue to use portion of its cash in excess of
its  requirements  for operations,  to purchase  short-term  investments and for
other  corporate  purposes.   Management,  from  time  to  time,  considers  the
acquisition  of capital  equipment,  particularly,  specific items of production
equipment   required  to  produce  certain  of  our  products,   storage  racks,
merchandise  display racks,  vans and  promotional  vehicles,  coolers and other
promotional  equipment and businesses  compatible with the image of the Companys
brands, as well as the introduction of new product lines.

     Cash  flows  from  financing  activities  -  Net  cash  used  in  financing
activities  was $113,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to net
cash provided by financing  activities of $1.3 million in the comparable  period
in 2004.  For the year ended  December  31,  2005,  cash  provided by  financing
activities was primarily  attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of
common  stock  pursuant to the  exercise of stock  options  which was  partially
offset by  principal  payments of  long-term  debt.  The increase in payments on
long-term  debt as compared to the  comparable  period in 2004  related to lease
payments made on vehicle leases entered into over the past year.



     Debt and other  obligations - HBC has a credit  facility from Comerica Bank
("Comerica"),  consisting of a revolving line of credit.  Such revolving line of
credit is  secured  by  substantially  all of HBCs  assets,  including  accounts
receivable,  inventory, trademarks and certain equipment. In accordance with the
provisions of the credit  facility,  HBC can borrow up to $7.8 million under its
revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit remains in full force and
effect through June 1, 2007.  Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is
based on Comericas  base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5% or varying LIBOR rates up
to 180 days plus an additional  percentage of up to 1.5%, depending upon certain
financial ratios maintained by HBC. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on
the line of credit at December 31, 2005.

     The  terms  of the  Companys  line  of  credit  contain  certain  financial
covenants including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with
its covenants at December 31, 2005.

     If any event of default  shall occur for any reason,  whether  voluntary or
involuntary,  Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of
credit  immediately due and payable,  exercise rights and remedies  available to
secured parties under the Uniform  Commercial Code,  institute legal proceedings
to foreclose upon the lien and security  interest granted or for the sale of any
or all collateral.

     Noncancelable  contractual  obligations  include our obligations  under our
agreement with the Las Vegas Monorail Company and other  commitments.  (See also
PART II ITEM 8 - NOTE 8, COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES).

     Purchase  commitments  include  obligations  made  by the  Company  and its
subsidiaries  to various  suppliers for raw materials used in the  manufacturing
and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms.

     The following represents a summary of the Company's contractual obligations
and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2005:


     In addition to the above  obligations,  pursuant to a can supply  agreement
between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company ("Rexam") dated as of January
1, 2006,  the Company has  undertaken  to purchase a minimum  volume of 24-ounce
resealable  aluminum  beverage  cans over the four year period  commencing  from
January 1, 2006 through  December 31, 2009.  Should the Company fail to purchase
the minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain
capital  reimbursements  on a pro rated basis. The Company's  maximum  liability
under this  agreement  is $4.3  million  subject to  compliance  by Rexam with a
number of conditions under this agreement.



     Management  believes that cash  available from  operations,  including cash
resources and the revolving  line of credit,  will be sufficient for our working
capital needs,  including purchase  commitments for raw materials and inventory,
increases in accounts receivable,  payments of tax liabilities,  debt servicing,
expansion and  development  needs,  purchases of shares of our common stock,  as
well as any  purchases  of  capital  assets or  equipment  for at least the next
twelve months.  Based on the Company's  current plans,  at this time the Company
estimates  that  capital  expenditures  are  likely to be less  than $5  million
through December 2006. However, future business opportunities may cause a change
in this estimate.

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements

      Critical Accounting Policies

     The Company's  consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP.  GAAP  requires the Company to make  estimates and  assumptions  that
affect the reported amounts in our consolidated  financial  statements including
various  allowances and reserves for accounts  receivable and  inventories,  the
estimated  lives of  long-lived  assets  and  trademarks  as well as claims  and
contingencies  arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the
normal  course  of  business.  The  following  summarize  the  most  significant
accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company:

     Trademarks  -  Trademarks   primarily   represent  the  Companys  exclusive
     ownership of the Hansen's(R)  trademark in connection with the manufacture,
     sale and distribution of beverages and water and non-beverage  products and
     the Monster  Energy(R)  trademark in connection with the manufacture,  sale
     and distribution of supplements and beverages. The Company also owns in its
     own right, a number of other  trademarks in the United States as well as in
     a number of  countries  around the world.  The  Company  also owns the Blue
     Sky(R)  trademark,  which was  acquired in September  2000,  and the Junior
     Juice(R)  trademark,  which was  acquired  in May 2001.  During  2002,  the
     Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets.  Under
     the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company  discontinued  amortization  on
     indefinite-lived   trademarks  while   continuing  to  amortize   remaining
     trademarks over one to 20 years.

     In accordance  with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our  trademarks  annually for
     impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment.  If there is
     an indication of impairment of identified  intangible assets not subject to
     amortization,  management  compares  the  estimated  fair  value  with  the
     carrying  amount of the asset.  An  impairment  loss is recognized to write
     down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying
     amount.  The fair value is calculated using the income  approach.  However,
     preparation  of  estimated   expected   future  cash  flows  is  inherently
     subjective  and is based  on  management's  best  estimate  of  assumptions
     concerning  expected  future  conditions.  Based on  managements  quarterly
     impairment  analysis  performed,  the  estimated  fair values of trademarks
     exceeded the carrying value.

     Long-Lived Assets - Management regularly reviews property and equipment and
     other long-lived assets,  including certain identifiable  intangibles,  for
     possible  impairment.  This review occurs  annually,  or more frequently if
     events or changes in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  amount of the
     asset may not be  recoverable.  If there is  indication  of  impairment  of
     property and equipment or amortizable  intangible  assets,  then management
     prepares  an  estimate  of future  cash  flows  (undiscounted  and  without
     interest  charges)  expected  to  result  from the use of the asset and its
     eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount
     of the asset,  an impairment  loss is recognized to write down the asset to
     its estimated fair value.  The fair value is estimated at the present value
     of  the  future  cash  flows  discounted  at  a  rate   commensurate   with
     management's   estimates  of  the  business  risks.  No  impairments   were
     identified  during 2005,  however,  during 2004,  management  recognized an
     impairment to property and equipment as discussed in Note 1 of the attached
     financial statements.



     Management  believes that the accounting  estimate related to impairment of
     its long lived assets, including its trademarks,  is a "critical accounting
     estimate"  because:  (1) it is highly  susceptible to change from period to
     period because it requires  company  management to make  assumptions  about
     cash flows and  discount  rates;  and (2) the impact  that  recognizing  an
     impairment  would have on the assets reported on our  consolidated  balance
     sheet, as well as net income,  could be material.  Managements  assumptions
     about cash flows and discount rates require  significant  judgment  because
     actual  revenues and expenses have  fluctuated in the past and are expected
     to continue to do so.

     In estimating future revenues,  we use internal  budgets.  Internal budgets
     are developed  based on recent revenue data and future  marketing plans for
     existing  product lines and planned timing of future  introductions  of new
     products and their impact on our future cash flows.

     Revenue  Recognition  - The  Company  recognizes  revenue  when  persuasive
     evidence of an arrangement exists,  delivery has occurred,  the sales price
     is  fixed or  reasonably  determinable  and  collectibility  is  reasonably
     assured.  Management  believes an adequate  provision against net sales has
     been made for estimated returns, allowances and cash discounts based on the
     Company's historical experience.

     Net Sales - Net sales  consist of sales  recorded  at the time the  related
     products are shipped and the risk of ownership and title have passed,  less
     allowances  for returns,  spoilage,  discounts and  promotional  allowances
     recorded in accordance  with Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No.
     01-9.

     Cost of  Sales - Cost of  sales  consists  of the  costs  of raw  materials
     utilized in the  manufacture  of our products,  co-packing  fees,  in-bound
     freight  charges  as well as certain  internal  transfer  costs,  warehouse
     expenses  incurred  prior  to the  manufacture  of the  Company's  finished
     products and certain quality control costs.  Raw materials  account for the
     largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans,  bottles,
     other containers, ingredients and packaging materials.

     Operating  Expenses - Operating  expenses  include selling expenses such as
     distribution  expenses  to  transport  our  products to our  customers  and
     warehousing  expenses after manufacture,  expenses  including  advertising,
     sampling and in-store  demonstration costs,  material costs for merchandise
     displays,  point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses,
     other  marketing  expenses and design  expenses.  Operating  expenses  also
     include  general and  administrative  costs such as payroll  costs,  travel
     costs,  professional  service  fees,  depreciation  and other  general  and
     administrative costs.

     Distribution  expenses,  which include  out-bound  freight and  warehousing
     expenses  after  manufacture,  were $22.1  million,  $12.4 million and $8.3
     million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively.

     Advertising  and  Promotional   Allowances  -  The  Company   accounts  for
     advertising  production  costs by expensing such production costs the first
     time the related advertising takes place. In addition, the Company supports
     its customers with promotional  allowances,  a portion of which is utilized
     for marketing and indirect  advertising  by them. In certain  instances,  a
     portion of the  promotional  allowances  payable to customers  based on the
     levels of sales to such customers,  promotion  requirements or expected use
     of the  allowances,  are  estimated by the Company.  If the level of sales,
     promotion  requirements  or use of the  allowances  are different from such
     estimates,  the  promotional  allowances  could,  to the  extent  based  on
     estimates,  require  adjustments.  The  Company  presents  advertising  and
     promotional allowances in accordance with the provisions of EITF No. 01-9.



     Accounts Receivable - The Company evaluates the collectibility of its trade
     accounts  receivable based on a number of factors.  In circumstances  where
     the Company  becomes  aware of a specific  customers  inability to meet its
     financial  obligations to the Company,  a specific reserve for bad debts is
     estimated  and recorded  which  reduces the  recognized  receivable  to the
     estimated  amount the Company  believes will  ultimately  be collected.  In
     addition to specific  customer  identification  of potential bad debts, bad
     debt  charges are recorded  based on the Companys  recent past loss history
     and  an  overall   assessment  of  past  due  trade   accounts   receivable
     outstanding.

     Inventories  -  Inventories  are  stated at the  lower of cost to  purchase
     and/or  manufacture the inventory or the current  estimated market value of
     the inventory.  The Company regularly  reviews its inventory  quantities on
     hand and  records a  provision  for excess  and  obsolete  inventory  based
     primarily on the Company's  estimated forecast of product demand and/or its
     ability  to sell the  product(s)  concerned  and  production  requirements.
     Demand for the  Company's  products can  fluctuate  significantly.  Factors
     which could affect demand for the Company's products include  unanticipated
     changes  in  consumer  preferences,  general  market  conditions  or  other
     factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction
     in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or  continued  weakening of
     economic conditions. Additionally, management's estimates of future product
     demand  may  be  inaccurate,  which  could  result  in  an  understated  or
     overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.

     Income  Taxes - Current  income tax  expense is the amount of income  taxes
     expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or
     liability is established for the expected future  consequences of temporary
     differences  in the  financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and
     liabilities.  The Company  considers  future  taxable  income and  ongoing,
     prudent and feasible tax planning  strategies in assessing the value of its
     deferred tax assets. If the Company  determines that it is more likely than
     not that these  assets will not be  realized,  the Company  will reduce the
     value  of  these  assets  to  their  expected  realizable  value,   thereby
     decreasing net income.  Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily
     based on the Company's  judgment.  If the Company  subsequently  determined
     that the  deferred  tax  assets,  which  had been  written  down,  would be
     realized  in the  future,  the value of the  deferred  tax assets  would be
     increased,   thereby   increasing  net  income  in  the  period  when  that
     determination  was  made.  See Note 9 in Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
     Statements.

      Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

     Information  regarding newly issued accounting  pronouncements is contained
in Note 1 to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements for the year ended December
31, 2005, which note is incorporated herein by this reference.

Sales

The table set forth below discloses  selected quarterly data regarding sales for
the past five  years.  Data  from any one or more  quarters  is not  necessarily
indicative of annual results or continuing trends.

*      Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means
a unit of measurement  equal to 192 U.S.  fluid ounces of finished  beverage (24
eight-ounce  servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces
of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases
(or unit case  equivalents)  of  beverages  directly or  indirectly  sold by the
Company.  Sales of food bars and cereals,  which have been  discontinued and are
not material, are expressed in actual cases.

     The Company's  quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that
are primarily  the result of increased  demand in the warmer months of the year.
It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first
and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.  Because the primary  historical market
for Hansens products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the
effect of seasonal  fluctuations  on quarterly  results may have been mitigated;
however,  such  fluctuations  may be  more  pronounced  as the  distribution  of
Hansen's  products expands outside of California.  The Companys  experience with
its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional
beverages.  As the percentage of the Companys sales that are represented by such
products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated.
Quarterly  fluctuations  may also be affected  by other  factors  including  the
introduction  of new  products,  the  opening of new markets  where  temperature
fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors,
changes in the mix of the sales of its  finished  products and changes in and/or
increased  advertising  and  promotional  expenses.  (See also "PART I ITEM 1. -
BUSINESS SEASONALITY").





Inflation

     The Company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations for the periods presented.

Forward Looking Statements

     The Private Security  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a
safe harbor for forward looking  statements made by or on behalf of the Company.
Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements
(within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933, as amended,  and
Section 21.E of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)  regarding the
expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability,  adequacy of
funds from operations and our existing credit facility,  among other things. All
statements  which address  operating  performance,  events or developments  that
management  expects or  anticipates  will or may occur in the  future  including
statements  related to new products,  volume  growth,  revenues,  profitability,
adequacy  of  funds  from  operations,  and/or  the  Company's  existing  credit
facility,  earnings per share growth,  statements  expressing  general  optimism
about  future  operating  results and non  historical  information,  are forward
looking  statements  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing, the words "believes",  "thinks",  "anticipates",  "plans", "expects",
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.



     Management  cautions  that these  statements  are  qualified by their terms
and/or  important  factors,  many of which are  outside our  control,  involve a
number of risks,  uncertainties  and other  factors,  that  could  cause  actual
results and events to differ materially from the statements made including,  but
not limited to, those  described  in "PART I ITEM 1A. - RISK  FACTORS" and other
risks  detailed  from  time to time in the  Company's  reports  filed  with  the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Such factors are not exhaustive.

     Our actual results could be materially different from the results described
or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty
of  estimates,  forecasts  and  projections  and may be  better  or  worse  than
anticipated.  Given these uncertainties,  you should not rely on forward-looking
statements.  Forward-looking  statements represent our estimates and assumptions
only as of the date that they  were  made.  We  expressly  disclaim  any duty to
provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions
associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes
in  circumstances  or  expectations  or the occurrence of  unanticipated  events
except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.

ITEM 7A.        QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

     In the normal  course of  business,  our  financial  position is  routinely
subject to a variety of risks.  The  principal  market risks (i.e.,  the risk of
loss arising from adverse  changes in market rates and prices) which the Company
is exposed to are  fluctuations  in commodity  prices  affecting the cost of raw
materials and changes in interest  rates of the Company's long term debt and the
limited  availability  of certain raw materials  such as sucralose.  We are also
subject to market  risks with  respect to the cost of  commodities  because  our
ability to recover  increased  costs  through  higher  pricing is limited by the
competitive  environment in which we operate. We are also subject to other risks
associated  with the business  environment  in which we operate,  including  the
collectibility of accounts receivable.

     At December 31, 2005, the majority of the Company's debt consisted of fixed
rather than  variable  rate debt.  The amount of variable  rate debt  fluctuates
during the year based on the Company's cash  requirements.  If average  interest
rates were to increase one percent for the year ended December 31, 2005, the net
impact on the Company's  pre-tax earnings would have been  insignificant.  There
have been no significant changes to the Company's exposure to market risks.

Executive   Officer  and  Chief  Financial   Officer,   we  have  evaluated  the
effectiveness  of the  design  and  operation  of our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures as of the end of the period  covered by this report.  Based upon this
evaluation,  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  have
concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are adequate and
effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that
we file or submit under the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 is (1)  recorded,
processed,  summarized  and reported  within the time  periods  specified in SEC
rules  and  forms  and (2) is  accumulated  and  communicated  to the  Company's
management,  including its principal  executive and principal financial officers
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

     There have been no changes in internal  control  over  financial  reporting
that  occurred  during  the  fiscal  period  covered  by this  report  that have
materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

     Management's  Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - Company
management is responsible for  establishing  and maintaining  adequate  internal
control over  financial  reporting,  as defined in Exchange Act Rule  13a-15(f).
Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  company  management,
including the principal executive officer and principal  financial officer,  the
company  conducted an evaluation of the  effectiveness  of its internal  control
over financial  reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission as of December 31, 2005. Based on the company's  evaluation under the
framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework,  management concluded that
the  company's  internal  control over  financial  reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2005.

     Management's  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of internal  control  over
financial  reporting  as of  December  31,  2005 has been  audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent  registered  public accounting firm, as stated in its
report, which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Hansen Natural Corporation
Corona, California

We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management
Report on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting,  that  Hansen  Natural
Corporation and  subsidiaries  (the  "Company")  maintained  effective  internal
control over  financial  reporting  as of December  31, 2005,  based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated  Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is
responsible for maintaining  effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the  effectiveness  of internal control over financial
reporting.   Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  management's
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted  our audit in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting,  evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other  procedures as we considered  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed by,
or under the  supervision  of, the company's  principal  executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company's  board of  directors,  management,  and  other  personnel  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of financial  statements for external  purposes in accordance  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States  of  America
("generally accepted accounting principles").  A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  the  inherent   limitations  of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management
override of controls,  material  misstatements  due to error or fraud may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also,  projections of any evaluation of
the  effectiveness  of the internal  control over financial  reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate  because
of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

     In  our  opinion,   managements  assessment  that  the  Company  maintained
effective internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  based on the criteria  established in
Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued by the  Committee of  Sponsoring
Organizations  of the  Treadway  Commission.  Also in our  opinion,  the Company
maintained, in all material respects,  effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.



We have also  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting   Oversight  Board  (United  States),   the  consolidated   financial
statements and financial  statement  schedule listed in Item 15(b) as of and for
the year ended  December 31, 2005,  of the Company and our report dated March 9,
2006  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  those  financial  statements  and
financial statement schedule.

securities of the Company.  Executive  officers,  directors and greater than ten
percent  stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with
copies of all  Section  16(a)  forms that they file.  The Company is required to
report in this  annual  report on Form 10-K any  failure  of its  directors  and

of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or non-qualified options. Such
options are  exercisable  at fair market value on the date of grant for a period
of up to ten years.  Under the Plan,  shares subject to options may be purchased
for cash,  or for shares of common stock valued at fair market value on the date
of purchase.  Under the Plan, no additional options may be granted after July 1,
2001.



     During 2001, the Company adopted the Hansen Natural  Corporation 2001 Stock
Option Plan ("2001 Option Plan"). The 2001 Option Plan provides for the grant of
options to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company to
certain key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options granted under
the 2001 Stock Option Plan may be incentive  stock  options under Section 422 of
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),  nonqualified stock options,
or stock appreciation rights.

     The Plan and the 2001  Option  Plan are  administered  by the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company,  comprised of directors  who
satisfy  the  "non-employee"  director  requirements  of Rule  16b-3  under  the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and the outside  director  provision of Section
162(m) of the Code.  Grants  under  the Plan and the 2001  Option  Plan are made
pursuant to  individual  agreements  between the Company and each  grantee  that
specifies the terms of the grant, including the exercise price, exercise period,
vesting and other terms thereof.

Outside Directors Stock Option Plans

     The Company had an option plan for its outside  directors  ("the  Directors
Plan") that  provided for the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of
200,000  shares of common  stock of the Company to  directors of the Company who
are not and have not been employed by or acted as consultants to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  or affiliates  and who are not and have not been nominated to
the Board of Directors  of the Company  pursuant to a  contractual  arrangement.
Under the Directors  Plan, no additional  options could be granted after July 1,
2004.

     During 2005, the Company adopted the 2005 Hansen Natural  Corporation Stock
Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2005 Directors Plan") that provides for
the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of 200,000  shares of common
stock of the Company to  non-employee  directors of the Company.  On the date of
the annual meeting of  stockholders  at which an eligible  director is initially
elected,  each eligible  director is entitled to receive a one-time  grant of an
option to purchase 6,000 shares of the Companys common stock  exercisable at the
closing price for a share of common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, on
the fifth anniversary of the election of eligible directors elected or appointed
to the Board,  and each fifth  anniversary  thereafter,  each eligible  director
shall receive an additional  grant of an option to purchase  4,800 shares of the
Companys common stock.  Options become  exercisable in four equal  installments,
with the  grant  immediately  vested  with  respect  to 25% of the grant and the
remaining installments vesting on the three successive anniversaries of the date
of grant;  provided that all options held by an eligible  director  become fully
and  immediately  exercisable  upon a change in control of the Company.  Options
granted under the 2005  Directors Plan that are not exercised  generally  expire
ten years  after the date of grant.  Option  grants  may be made  under the 2005
Directors Plan for ten years from the effective date of the Directors  Plan. The
Directors  Plan  is  a  "formula   plan"  so  that  a   non-employee   directors
participation   in  the  Directors   Plan  does  not  affect  his  status  as  a
"disinterested  person" (as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934). Four eligible directors were initially granted options to purchase
4,800 shares of the Companys  common stock pursuant to the 2005 Directors  Plan,
(see  "PART III ITEM 12  SECURITY  OWNERSHIP  OF CERTAIN  BENEFICIAL  OWNERS AND
RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS").

subject to a specific  budget.  The Audit  Committee has delegated  pre-approval
authority to its  Chairman  when  necessary  due to timing  considerations.  Any
services  approved by the Chairman must be reported to the full Audit  Committee
at its next  scheduled  meeting.  The  independent  auditors and  management are
required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent
of  services  provided  by the  independent  auditors  in  accordance  with  the

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Hansen Natural Corporation
Corona, California



We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Hansen Natural
Corporation and  subsidiaries  ("the Company") as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December  31,  2005.  Our
audits also  included the  financial  statement  schedule  listed in Item 15(b).
These   financial   statements   and  financial   statement   schedule  are  the
responsibility of the Companys  management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial  statements and financial  statement  schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2005
and 2004,  and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  2005,  in  conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also,
in our opinion,  such financial statement schedule,  when considered in relation
to the  basic  consolidated  financial  statements  taken as a  whole,  presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the  effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
criteria  established  in Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated March 9, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's  assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial  reporting
and an  unqualified  opinion  on the  effectiveness  of the  Company's  internal
control over financial reporting.

HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Organization  Hansen  Natural  Corporation  (the "Company" or "Hansen") was
incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1990. The Company is a holding company and
has no operating business except through its direct  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,
Hansen Beverage  Company  ("HBC") which was  incorporated in Delaware on June 8,
1992 and Monster LDA Company ("MLDA") formally known as Hard e Beverage Company,
and previously  known as Hard Energy Company and CVI Ventures,  Inc.,  which was
incorporated  in Delaware on April 30, 1990.  HBC conducts the vast  majority of
the Companys operating business and generates  substantially all of the Companys
operating revenues.  References herein to "Hansen" or the "Company" when used to
describe the operating business of the Company are references to the business of
HBC  unless  otherwise  indicated,  and  references  herein to MLDA when used to
describe  the  operating  business of MLDA,  are to the  business of MLDA unless
otherwise indicated.

     In addition, HBC, through its wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  Blue Sky Natural
Beverage Co. ("Blue Sky") and Hansen Junior Juice Company  ("Junior Juice") owns
and operates the natural soda business  under the Blue Sky(R)  trademark and the
Junior   Juice(R)   beverage   business  under  the  Junior  Juice   trademarks,
respectively.

     Nature of Operations - Hansen markets and distributes  Hansen's(R)  Natural
Sodas, Signature Sodas, fruit juice Smoothies, energy drinks, Energade(R) energy
sports  drinks,  E20  Energy  Water(R),   Sparkling  Lemonades  and  Orangeades,
multi-vitamin juice drinks in aseptic packaging,  Junior Juice juice, iced teas,
lemonades and juice cocktails,  apple juice, cider and juice blends, Blue Sky(R)
brand  carbonated  beverages,  Monster  Energy(R)  brand energy drinks,  Lost(R)
Energy brand energy drinks, Rumba(TM) brand Energy Juice and Fizzit(TM) powdered
drink mixes.

     Basis of Presentation - The accompanying  consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States of America ("generally accepted accounting principles").

     Principles  of  Consolidation  - The  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements  include the  accounts of Hansen and its wholly  owned  subsidiaries,
HBC,  MLDA,  Blue  Sky  and  Junior  Juice  since  their   respective  dates  of
incorporation.  All intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

     Stock Split - On August 8, 2005,  the common stock of the Company was split
on a  two-for-one  basis  through  a 100%  stock  dividend.  All  per-share  and
outstanding share information has been presented to reflect the stock split.

          Cash and Cash  Equivalents  - The Company  invests  cash  available in
     various  investments  from  time to time  including,  but not  limited  to,
     investments of the following  nature:  auction rate  securities,  corporate
     bank debt, commercial paper,  certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury bills,
     notes and bonds,  money  market funds and tax exempt  securities  including
     municipal notes.  Those investments that have maturity dates of ninety days
     or less are included in Cash and cash equivalents whereas those investments
     that  have  maturity  dates  in  excess  of  ninety  days are  included  in
     "Short-term  investments".  The  Company  did not have any  investments  in
     auction rate securities at December 31, 2005 but did hold such  investments
     at December 31, 2004. As a result, we reclassified $17.3 million from "Cash
     and  cash  equivalents"  to  "Short-term   investments"  in  our  Condensed
     Consolidated  Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004. This  reclassification
     has no impact on previously  reported total current  assets,  total assets,
     working  capital,  or results of operations and does not affect  previously
     reported cash flows from operating or financing activities.  Throughout the
     year,  the Company had amounts on deposit at a financial  institution  that
     exceed the depository insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any
     loss as a result of these  deposits and does not expect to incur any losses
     in the future.



     Inventories  - Inventories  are valued at the lower of first-in,  first-out
(FIFO) cost or market value (net realizable value).

     Property  and  Equipment  -  Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost.
Depreciation of furniture, office equipment,  equipment and vehicles is based on
their  estimated  useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated  using the
straight-line  method.  Amortization  of leasehold  improvements is based on the
lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is
calculated using the straight-line method.

     Trademarks - Trademarks  represents the Companys exclusive ownership of the
Hansens  trademark in connection with the manufacture,  sale and distribution of
beverages  and  water  and  non-beverage  products  and  the  Monster  Energy(R)
trademark  in  connection  with  the  manufacture,   sale  and  distribution  of
supplements and beverages. The Company also owns a number of other trademarks in
the United  States as well as in a number of  countries  around  the world.  The
Company  also owns the Blue Sky(R)  trademark,  which was  acquired in September
2000,  and the Junior  Juice(R)  trademark,  which was acquired in May 2001. The
Company amortizes its trademarks over their useful lives of 1 to 20 years.

     Long-Lived Assets - Management regularly reviews property and equipment and
other  long-lived  assets,  including  certain  identifiable  intangibles,   for
possible impairment.  This review occurs annually,  or more frequently if events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable.  If there is  indication of impairment of property and equipment or
amortizable  intangible assets,  then management  prepares an estimate of future
cash flows  (undiscounted  and without interest charges) expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If these cash flows are less
than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write
down the asset to its estimated  fair value.  The fair value is estimated at the
present value of the future cash flows  discounted at a rate  commensurate  with
management's  estimates of the business risks. Annually, or earlier, if there is
indication  of  impairment  of  identified  intangible  assets  not  subject  to
amortization,  management  compares the  estimated  fair value with the carrying
amount  of the  asset.  An  impairment  loss is  recognized  to  write  down the
intangible  asset to its  fair  value if it is less  than the  carrying  amount.
Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and
is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future
conditions.  For the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  the  Company  recognized
impairment on operating equipment in cost of sales of $587,877.  For 2005, there
was no impairment losses recorded.

     Revenue  Recognition  - The  Company  recognizes  revenue  when  persuasive
evidence of an  arrangement  exists,  delivery has occurred,  the sales price is
fixed or  determinable  and  collectibility  is reasonably  assured.  Management
believes an adequate provision has been made for estimated  returns,  allowances
and cash  discounts  based on the  Company's  historical  experience,  which are
accounted for as a reduction of gross sales.

     Freight Costs and  Reimbursement of Freight Costs - In accordance with EITF
No. 00-10,  Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs,  reimbursements
of freight  charges are recorded in net sales in the  accompanying  consolidated
statements  of income.  For the years ended  December 31,  2005,  2004 and 2003,
freight-out  costs  amounted to $19.1  million,  $10.7 million and $7.0 million,
respectively,  and have been  recorded  in selling,  general and  administrative
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.



     Advertising  and  Promotional   Allowances  -  The  Company   accounts  for
advertising  production  costs by expensing such production costs the first time
the related  advertising takes place.  Advertising  expenses,  including but not
limited to production costs,  amounted to $18.0 million,  $10.8 million and $7.9
million for the years ended  December  31,  2005,  2004 and 2003,  respectively.
Advertising  expenses  are  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative
expenses.

     Income Taxes - The Company  accounts for income taxes under the  provisions
of SFAS No. 109,  Accounting  for Income  Taxes.  This  statement  requires  the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  for the future  consequences
of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial  statements or tax
returns.  Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the
event the future  consequences of differences  between financial reporting bases
and tax bases of the Companys  assets and  liabilities  result in a deferred tax
asset,  SFAS No. 109 requires an evaluation of the  probability of being able to
realize  the future  benefits  indicated  by such asset.  A valuation  allowance
related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

     Stock-Based  Compensation - The Company accounts for its stock option plans
in accordance with Accounting  Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25,  Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,  and related  Interpretations.  Under APB Opinion
No.25, no compensation  expense is recognized  because the exercise price of the
Companys  employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock
at the date of the grant. In December 2002, the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board    ("FASB")    issued   SFAS   No.148,    Accounting    for    Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition  and  Disclosure.   Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  ("SFAS")  No.148  amends  SFAS  No.123,  Accounting  for  Stock-based
Compensation,  and was effective immediately upon issuance.  The Company follows
the requirements of APB Opinion No.25 and the disclosure-only  provision of SFAS
No.123, as amended by SFAS No.148. Had compensation cost for the Companys option
plans  been  determined  based on the fair  value at the grant  date for  awards
consistent  with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income and net
income per common share for the years ended  December  31,  2005,  2004 and 2003
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below.  Additionally,
the effect of the stock  split,  which was  effective  August 8, 2005,  has been
given effect to all years presented (Note 1).





The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes   option-pricing   model  with  the   following   weighted-average
assumptions used:




     Net Income Per Common Share - In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share,  net income per common share,  on a basic and diluted basis, is presented
for all  periods.  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding . Diluted net income
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted  average  number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding.

     Concentration  Risk - Certain of the Companys  products utilize  components
(raw materials and/or co-packing  services) from a limited number of sources.  A
disruption  in the  supply of such  components  could  significantly  affect the
Companys revenues from those products, as alternative sources of such components
may not be available  at  commercially  reasonable  rates or within a reasonably
short time period.  The Company  continues to take steps on an ongoing  basis to
secure the availability of alternative  sources for such components and minimize
the risk of any disruption in production.

     One customer accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the Company's sales
for the years  ended  December  31, 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  A decision by
that, or any other large  customer,  to decrease the amount  purchased  from the
Company or to cease carrying the Companys products could have a material adverse
effect  on  the  Companys  financial  condition  and  consolidated   results  of
operations.

     During 2005, 2004 and 2003,  sales outside of California  represented  62%,
56% and 47% of the aggregate sales of the Company, respectively.

     Credit Risk - The  Company  sells its  products  nationally,  primarily  to
retailers  and  beverage  distributors.  The  Company  performs  ongoing  credit
evaluations  of its  customers and generally  does not require  collateral.  The
Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses,  and historically,  such
losses have been within managements expectations.

     Fair Value of Financial  Instruments  - At December 31, 2005 and 2004,  the
carrying values of cash,  accounts  receivable and accounts payable  approximate
fair  value  because  of the  short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.
Long-term debt bears interest at a rate comparable to the prime rate; therefore,
management  believes  the  carrying  amount for the  outstanding  borrowings  at
December 31, 2005 approximates fair value.

     Use of Estimates - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Segment  Information  - The Company  has two  reportable  segments,  namely
Direct Store Delivery ("DSD"),  whose principal products comprise energy drinks,
and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages.



     Newly Issued  Accounting  Pronouncements  - In November  2004,  FASB issued
statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 151, "Inventory Costs". The new
Statement  amends  Accounting  Research  Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,  "Inventory
Pricing",  to clarify  the  accounting  for  abnormal  amounts of idle  facility
expense,  freight,  handling costs, and wasted material. This Statement requires
that those items be  recognized  as  current-period  charges and  requires  that
allocation of fixed  production  overheads to the cost of conversion be based on
the normal  capacity of the production  facilities.  This statement is effective
for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement
will have an  immaterial  impact  on the  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations of the Company.

     In December  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,  Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets  An  Amendment  of  APB  Opinion  No.  29,   Accounting  for  Nonmonetary
Transactions.  This  statement  amends  APB  Opinion  No.  29 to  eliminate  the
exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it
with a general  exception for exchanges of  nonmonetary  assets that do not have
commercial  substance.  A nonmonetary  exchange has commercial  substance if the
future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result
of the  exchange.  The  provision in SFAS No. 153 is effective  for  nonmonetary
asset exchanges  incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The
adoption  of this  statement  will have an  immaterial  impact on the  financial
condition and results of operations of the Company.

     In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based
Payment.  This  Statement  replaces FASB  Statement No. 123 and  supersedes  APB
Opinion No. 25. SFAS No.  123(R) will require the fair value of all stock option
awards issued to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting
period. The Statement also requires the recognition of compensation  expense for
the fair value of any unvested  stock option awards  outstanding  at the date of
adoption.  This  standard  is  effective  for the Company as of January 1, 2006.
Management  has  concluded  it will adopt the modified  prospective  application
method. Management has not completed their evaluation of the effect of these new
rules  on the  Companys  financial  statements  but  expects  the  effect  to be
material.

     In May  2005,  FASB  issued  SFAS No.  154,  Accounting  Changes  and Error
Corrections, which establishes, unless impracticable,  retrospective application
as the required  method for  reporting a change in  accounting  principle in the
absence  of  explicit  transition  requirements  specific  to the newly  adopted
accounting  principle.  The statement provides guidance for determining  whether
retrospective  application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable.
The statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of error by restating
previously issued financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting
changes and  corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December
15,  2005.  The Company  does not expect  adoption of this  statement  to have a
material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

2.      SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

     We consider all  short-term,  highly  liquid  investments  having  original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  All investments with
original  maturities  greater than three months but less than twelve  months are
considered to be short-term investments.

     We classify our debt securities in one of two categories:  held-to-maturity
or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities in which
we have the  positive  intent  and  ability to hold  until  maturity.  All other
securities    not   included   in    held-to-maturity    are    classified    as
available-for-sale. No securities are held for speculative or trading purposes.

     Held-to-maturity  securities are recorded at amortized  cost,  adjusted for
the amortization of accretion of premiums or discounts.  A decline in the market
value of any  held-to-maturity  security  below  cost that is deemed  other than
temporary  results  in a  reduction  in  carrying  amount  to  fair  value.  The
impairment  is charged to  earnings  and a new cost  basis for the  security  is
established.  Premiums and  discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of
the  related  held-to-maturity  security  as an  adjustment  to yield  using the
effective-interest  method.  The Company  evaluates  whether the decline in fair
value of its  investments  is  other-than  temporary at each  quarter-end.  This
evaluation  consists of a review by  management,  and  includes  market  pricing
information  and maturity  dates for the  securities  held,  market and economic
trends in the  industry  and  information  on the  investee  companys  financial
condition.



     The carrying  amount,  gross  unrealized  holding gains,  gross  unrealized
holding  losses  and fair  value  for  available-for-sale  and  held-to-maturity
short-term investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:




3.      INVENTORIES

4.      PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment consist of the following at December 31:



5.      TRADEMARK AND TRADEMARK AMORTIZATIONS

     As of December 31, 2004 and 2005, the trademarks were tested for impairment
in accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS No. 142. Fair values were  estimated
based on the  Company's  best  estimate of the expected  present value of future
cash flows.  No amounts were  impaired at those dates.  The  following  provides
additional information concerning the Company's trademarks as of December 31:


                                       2005                        2004

                                 ====================       ====================


     All  amortizing  trademarks  have been assigned an estimated  finite useful
life, and are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the number of years that
approximate   their  respective   useful  lives  ranging  from  1  to  20  years
(weighted-average  life of 19 years).  The straight-line  method of amortization
allocates  the cost of the  trademarks  to earnings  over the period of expected
benefit.  Total amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2005 was
$70,102. As of December 31, 2005, future estimated  amortization expense related
to amortizing trademarks through the year ended December 31, 2010 is:


                       2006             $55,739
                       2007              55,739
                       2008              55,590
                       2009              55,590
                       2010              55,590



6.      DEBT

     HBC has a credit facility from Comerica Bank ("Comerica"),  consisting of a
revolving  line  of  credit.  Such  revolving  line  of  credit  is  secured  by
substantially all of HBC's assets,  including  accounts  receivable,  inventory,
trademarks  and certain  equipment.  In  accordance  with the  provisions of the
credit  facility,  HBC can borrow up to $7.8 million under its revolving line of
credit.  The  revolving  line of credit  remains  effect  through  June 1, 2007.
Interest  on  borrowings  under the line of credit  is based on  Comericas  base
(prime)  rate  minus up to 1.5% or  varying  LIBOR  rates up to 180 days plus an
additional  percentage of up to 1.5%,  depending upon certain  financial  ratios
maintained  by HBC.  The Company had no  outstanding  borrowings  on the line of
credit at December 31, 2005.



     The  terms  of the  Companys  line  of  credit  contain  certain  financial
     covenants based on certain financial ratios.  The Company was in compliance
     with its  covenants at December 31, 2005.  Long-term  debt  consists of the
     following at December 31:



       Long-term debt is payable as follows:

                  Years ending December 31:
                  2006                     $         515,221

                                           =================


     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the assets acquired under capital leases had
a net book value of $1,035,046 and $402,245, net of accumulated  depreciation of
$338,901 and $518,988, respectively.

     Interest expense recorded,  including those for capital lease  obligations,
amounted to $55,576,  $35,988 and $66,592 for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

7.      EARNINGS PER SHARE

     A  reconciliation  of the  weighted  average  shares  used in the basic and
diluted  earnings  per common share  computations  for the three and years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004 is presented below:


     For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,  options  outstanding
totaling 507,200, 34,500 and 20,000 shares respectively,  were excluded from the
calculations, as their effect would have been antidilutive.



8.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Operating Leases - The Company leases its warehouse  facility and corporate
offices under a 10 year lease  expiring in 2010.  The facility lease and certain
equipment and other  noncancelable  operating  leases which expire through 2010.
The facility  lease has scheduled  rent  increases  which are accounted for on a
straight-line  basis.  Rent expense  under such leases  amounted to  $1,080,107,
$965,730,  and  $660,616 for the years ended  December 31, 2005,  2004 and 2003,
respectively.  In January 2004, the Company  entered into a lease for additional
warehouse  space.  This  lease  expires  in March  2008  with an option to renew
through 2010.

     Future  minimum  rental  payments at December 31, 2005 under the  operating
leases referred to above are as follows: Year ending December 31:

        Year ending December 31:

        2006                      $   1,289,343
        2007                          1,279,292
        2008                            986,010
        2009                            888,864
        2010 and thereafter             666,648

                                 ==============

     Purchase  Commitments  - The Company has purchase  commitments  aggregating
approximately $11.7 million, which represent commitments made by the Company and
its subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the manufacturing and
packaging of its products. These obligations vary in terms.

     In addition to the above  obligations,  pursuant to a can supply  agreement
between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company ("Rexam") dated as of January
1, 2006,  the Company has  undertaken  to purchase a minimum  volume of 24-ounce
resealable  aluminum  beverage  cans over the four year period  commencing  from
January 1, 2006 through  December 31, 2009.  Should the Company fail to purchase
the minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain
capital  reimbursements  on a pro rated basis.  The Companys  maximum  liability
under this  agreement  is $4.3  million  subject to  compliance  by Rexam with a
number of conditions under this agreement.

     The  Company  purchases  various raw  material  items,  including,  but not
limited  to,  flavors,  ingredients  and  containers,  from a limited  number of
resources.  An interruption in supply from any of such resources could result in
the  Companys  inability  to produce  certain  products  for limited or possibly
extended  periods of time.  The aggregate  value of purchases  from suppliers of
such limited resources  described above for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
$46.4 million.

     Advertising  Commitment - In March 2003,  HBC entered  into an  advertising
display  agreement  ("Monorail  Agreement")  with the Las Vegas Monorail Company
("LVMC") in terms of which HBC was granted the right,  in  consideration  of the
payment by HBC to LVMC of the sum of $1,000,000 per year, payable quarterly,  to
advertise and promote its products on a designated four car monorail  vehicle as
well as the right to sell certain of its  products on all monorail  stations for
payment of additional consideration.

     The initial term of the  Monorail  Agreement  commenced  in July 2004.  The
initial  term of the Monorail  Agreement  ends on the first  anniversary  of its
commencement  date.  However  due  to  interruptions  in the  operations  of the
Monorail,  the commencement  date of the initial term was extended to January 1,
2005.  Not less than 120 days before the expiration of the initial term and each
renewal  term,  as the case may be,  HBC has the  right  to renew  the  Monorail
Agreement  for a further  one year term up to a maximum of nine  additional  one
year terms and the LVMC has the right,  notwithstanding such election by HBC, to
terminate the Monorail Agreement at the expiration of the then current term. The
Company renewed the Monorail Agreement for an additional one-year term.



     Licensing Agreements - The Company produces,  sells and distributes Lost(R)
Energy  drinks  under an  exclusive  license  with Lost  International  LLC. The
license  agreement  requires  certain royalty payments to be made related to the
sale of Lost(R) brand  products.  Royalty  expense under this  agreement for the
years 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $594,803, $351,773, and $0, respectively.

     Employment and Consulting Agreements - On June 1, 2003, the Company entered
into an  employment  agreement  with  Rodney C. Sacks and  Hilton H.  Schlosberg
pursuant to which Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg render services to the Company as
its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  and its Vice Chairman,  President and
Chief Financial Officer, respectively. The agreements provide for an annual base
salary of $230,000 each for the 7 months ended December 31, 2003,  increasing to
$245,000 for the year ending December 31, 2004 and increasing by a minimum of 5%
for each  subsequent  twelve-month  period  during  the  employment  period.  In
addition,  the agreement provides for an annual bonus in an amount determined at
the  discretion  of the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  as well as certain
fringe benefits for the period  commencing  June1,  2003 and ending December 31,
2008.  Compensation expense related to these agreements for the years 2005, 2004
and 2003 was $ 799,156, $ 727,619 and $ 548,752, respectively.

     Litigation  - The  Company  is  subject  to, and  involved  in,  claims and
contingencies  related to lawsuits,  and other matters arising out of the normal
course of business.  In management's  opinion, the ultimate liability associated
with such  claims and  contingencies,  if any,  is not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.

     In  September  2004,  Barrington  Capital  Corporation  through  an alleged
successor in interest,  Sandburg Financial  Corporation (both entities with whom
the Company has never had any dealings) served a Notice of Motion  ("Motion") on
the  Company  and  each of its  subsidiaries  as well as on a  number  of  other
unrelated entities and individuals. The Motion seeks to amend a default judgment
granted against a completely unconnected company, Hansen Foods, Inc., to add the
Company  and  its  subsidiary  companies,  as  well as the  other  entities  and
individuals  cited,  as judgment  debtors.  The default  judgment was entered on
February 15, 1996, for $7,626,000  plus legal interest and attorneys fees in the
sum of  $211,000  arising  out of a breach  of  contract  claim  that  allegedly
occurred  in  the  1980s.  Barrington  Capital  Corporations/Sandburg  Financial
Corporations claim is based on the misconceived and unsubstantiated  theory that
the Company and its  subsidiaries  are alter egos  and/or  successors  of Hansen
Foods, Inc. In managements  opinion,  the Motion is based on demonstrably  false
allegations,  misstated legal propositions and lacks any substantial  supporting
evidence.  The Company and its subsidiaries  are vigorously  opposing the Motion
and believe  that the Motion is without any merit.  The Company does not believe
the Motion will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
Company.

     In June 2005,  the Company  filed a complaint in  California  federal court
against North American  Beverage Company ("NAB") seeking an injunction,  damages
and other  relief  arising out of NAB's  infringement  of the  Companys  Monster
Energy(TM)  marks through the promotion and advertising of carbonated  beverages
under the mark  "Flathead  Lake Monster" with the word  "Monster"  predominantly
displayed.   In  response,   in  July  2005,   "Flathead  Lake  Monster",   Inc.
("Flathead"),  a Montana corporation which allegedly licensed the mark "Flathead
Lake Monster" to NAB, filed a complaint  against the Company in federal court in
Montana in which it alleges that it is the licensor of the mark  "Flathead  Lake
Monster"  and sought a  declaration  that its use of that mark for soda does not
infringe the Companys rights in its "Monster Energy" marks.  Flatheads complaint
also in the  alternative  claimed  trademark  infringement by the Company to the
extent a court finds a  likelihood  of confusion  between the parties  marks and
sought an injunction  against the Company from using the term "Monster  Energy",
as well as damages and other  relief.  In December  2005,  all of the  aforesaid
proceedings  including  the  complaint  filed  by the  Company  as  well  as the
complaint filed by Flathead Lake were settled on terms deemed to be favorable to
the Company.



     Guarantees  - The Company  from time to time enters into  certain  types of
contracts that  contingently  require the Company to indemnify  parties  against
third party claims.  These contracts primarily relate to: (i) certain agreements
with the Company's officers, directors and employees under which the Company may
be required to  indemnify  such  persons  for  liabilities  arising out of their
employment relationship,  (ii) certain distribution or purchase agreements under
which the Company may have to indemnify the Company's  customers from any claim,
liability  or loss  arising  out of any  actual or  alleged  injury  or  damages
suffered  in  connection  with the  consumption  or  purchase  of the  Company's
products,  and (iii) certain real estate leases,  under which the Company may be
required to indemnify  property  owners for liabilities and other claims arising
from the Company's use of the applicable premises.

     The terms of such obligations vary. Generally,  a maximum obligation is not
explicitly  stated.  Because the obligated  amounts of these types of agreements
often are not explicitly  stated,  the overall maximum amount of the obligations
cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the Company believes that its insurance
coverage  is  adequate to cover any  liabilities  or claims  arising out of such
instances referred to above. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to
make significant payments for these obligations and accordingly, the Company has
not valued these  obligations on its consolidated  balance sheets as of December
31, 2005 and 2004.

     The Company has four stock option  plans,  the  Employee  Stock Option Plan
(the "Plan"),  the Outside Directors Stock Option Plan ("Directors  Plan"),  the
Hansen Natural  Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan ("2001 Option Plan"), and the
2005 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2005 Directors Plan").

     The Plan, as amended,  provided for the granting of options to purchase not
more than  6,000,000  shares  of Hansen  common  stock to key  employees  of the
Company and its subsidiaries through July 1, 2001. Stock options are exercisable
at such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation  Committee of
the Board of Directors  of the Company up to a ten-year  period after their date
of grant,  and no options may be granted  after July 1, 2001.  The option  price
will not be less  than the fair  market  value at the date of  grant.  As of the
expiration  date, July 1, 2001,  options to purchase  4,191,400 shares of Hansen
common stock had been granted under the Plan, net of options that had expired.

     The  Directors  Plan  provides  for the grant of options to  purchase up to
200,000  shares of common  stock of the Company to  directors of the Company who
are not and have not been employed by or acted as consultants to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  or affiliates  and who are not and have not been nominated to
the Board of Directors of the Company (the  "Board")  pursuant to a  contractual
arrangement.  On the date of the  annual  meeting of  stockholders,  at which an
eligible  director is initially  elected,  each eligible director is entitled to
receive a one-time  grant of an option to purchase  12,000 shares (24,000 shares
if the director is serving on a committee  of the Board) of the Companys  common
stock,  exercisable one-third each on the first, second and third anniversary of
the date of grant;  provided,  however,  that options granted as of February 14,
1995,  are  exercisable  66 2/3% on the date of grant and 100% on July 8,  1995;
provided,  further,  that all options held by an eligible  director become fully
and  immediately  exercisable  upon a change in control of the Company.  Options
granted under the Directors  Plan that are not  exercised  generally  expire ten
years  after the date of grant.  Option  grants may be made under the  Directors
Plan for ten years from the effective date of the Directors  Plan. The Directors
Plan is a "formula plan" so that a nonemployee  directors  participation  in the
Directors  Plan does not  affect  his  status as a  "disinterested  person"  (as
defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). As of December
31,  2005,  options to purchase  96,000  shares of Hansen  common stock had been
granted  under the  Directors  Plan and  options to purchase  104,000  shares of
Hansen common stock remained available for grant.



     During 2001,  the Company  adopted the 2001 Option Plan which  provides for
the grant of options to purchase up to  4,000,000  shares of the common stock of
the  Company to certain  key  employees  of the  Company  and its  subsidiaries.
Options  granted under the 2001 Option Plan may be incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),  nonqualified
stock options,  or stock appreciation  rights.  Stock options are exercisable at
such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of  Directors  of the Company up to a ten-year  period after their date of
grant. As of December 31, 2005,  options to purchase  3,918,200 shares of Hansen
common stock had been granted under the 2001 Option Plan and options to purchase
81,800 shares of Hansen  common stock remain  available for grant under the 2001
Option Plan.

     During 2005, the Company adopted the 2005 Hansen Natural  Corporation Stock
Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2005 Directors Plan") that provides for
the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of 200,000  shares of common
stock of the Company to  non-employee  directors of the Company.  On the date of
the annual meeting of  stockholders  at which an eligible  director is initially
elected,  each eligible  director is entitled to receive a one-time  grant of an
option to purchase 6,000 shares of the Company's common stock exercisable at the
closing price for a share of common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, on
the fifth anniversary of the election of eligible directors elected or appointed
to the Board,  and each fifth  anniversary  thereafter,  each eligible  director
shall receive an additional  grant of an option to purchase  4,800 shares of the
Companys common stock.  Options become  exercisable in four equal  installments,
with the  grant  immediately  vested  with  respect  to 25% of the grant and the
remaining installments vesting on the three successive anniversaries of the date
of grant;  provided that all options held by an eligible  director  become fully
and  immediately  exercisable  upon a change in control of the Company.  Options
granted under the 2005  Directors Plan that are not exercised  generally  expire
ten years  after the date of grant.  Option  grants  may be made  under the 2005
Directors Plan for ten years from the effective date of the Directors  Plan. The
Directors  Plan  is  a  "formula   plan"  so  that  a   non-employee   directors
participation   in  the  Directors   Plan  does  not  affect  his  status  as  a
"disinterested  person" (as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934).  As of December 31,  2005,  options to purchase  19,200  shares of
Hansen  common stock had been granted  under the  Directors  Plan and options to
purchase 180,800 shares of Hansen common stock remained available for grant.



     During the years  ended  December  31,  2005,  2004 and 2003,  the  Company
granted 1,546,200, 742,000 and 710,000 options to purchase shares under the 2001
Option Plan and the 2005  Directors Plan at a  weighted-average  grant date fair
value of $21.97, $3.34 and $0.64.  Additional information regarding the plans is
