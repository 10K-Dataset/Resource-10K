Corporate
History

In the
1930s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons started a business to sell fresh
non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles, California.  This business eventually became Hansen’s
Juices, Inc., which subsequently became known as The Fresh Juice Company
of California, Inc. (“FJC”).  FJC
retained the right to market and sell fresh non-pasteurized juices under the
Hansen trademark.  In 1977, Tim Hansen,
one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a demand for pasteurized
natural juices and juice blends that are shelf stable and formed Hansen Foods, Inc.
(“HFI”). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen’s Natural
Sodas®.  The California Co-Packers Corporation
(d/b/a/ Hansen Beverage Company) (“CCC”) acquired certain assets of HFI,
including the right to market the Hansen’s® brand name, in January 1990.  On July 27, 1992, HBC acquired the
Hansen’s® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC.  Under our ownership, the Hansen beverage
business has significantly


expanded and
includes a wide range of beverages within the growing “alternative” beverage
category, including in particular, energy drinks.  In September 1999, we acquired all of
FJC’s rights to manufacture, sell and distribute fresh non-pasteurized juice
products under the Hansen’s® trademark together with certain additional
rights.  In 2000, HBC, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co. (“Blue Sky”), which was
incorporated in Delaware on September 8, 2000, acquired the natural soda
business previously conducted by Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co., a New Mexico
corporation (“BSNBC”), under the Blue Sky® trademark.  In 2001, HBC, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary Hansen Junior Juice Company, (“Junior Juice”), which was
incorporated in Delaware on May 7, 2001, acquired the Junior Juice
business previously conducted by Pasco Juices, Inc. (“Pasco”) under the
Junior Juice® trademark.

Industry
Overview

The “alternative”
beverage category combines non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades,
juice cocktails, single serve juices and fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy
and coffee drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks, and single-serve still water
(flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with “new age” beverages, including sodas
that are considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling
beverages.  The “alternative” beverage
category is the fastest growing segment of the beverage marketplace according
to Beverage Marketing Corporation. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation,
wholesale sales in 2008 for the “alternative” beverage category of the market
are estimated at $26.0 billion representing a growth rate of approximately 2.8%
over the estimated wholesale sales in 2007 of approximately $25.3 billion
(revised from previously reported estimate of $25.5 billion).

Reportable Segments

We have two reportable segments, namely Direct Store
Delivery (“DSD”), whose principal products comprise primarily energy drinks,
and Warehouse (“Warehouse”), whose principal products comprise juice based and
soda beverages.  The DSD segment
develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor
network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products
primarily directly to retailers. 
Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to the DSD or
Warehouse segments specifically have been allocated to “Corporate &
Unallocated.”  Net sales of our DSD
segment represented 90.7%, 89.5% and 84.9% of our consolidated net sales for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

For financial information about our reporting
segments and geographic areas, refer to Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 – “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data” of this report, incorporated herein by reference.  For certain risks with respect to our energy
drinks see “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” below.

Bottled
Water -

Our still
water product was introduced in 1993 and is now sold in 0.5-liter plastic
bottles, primarily to the food service trade. Sales of this product line are
very limited.

During
2008, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our
markets.  In particular, we continued to
focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category
generally described as the “alternative” beverage category, with particular
emphasis on energy type drinks.

Other Products

We
continue to evaluate and, where considered appropriate, introduce additional
flavors and types of beverages to complement our existing product lines.  We will also evaluate, and may, where
considered appropriate, introduce “functional” foods/snack foods that utilize
similar channels of distribution and/or are complementary to our existing
products and/or to which our brand names are able to add value.

We also develop and supply, on a limited basis, selected beverages in
different formats to a limited number of customers with the objective of
solidifying our relationship with those customers.

Manufacture
and Distribution

We do not directly manufacture our products but instead outsource the
manufacturing process to third party bottlers and contract packers.

We purchase concentrates, juices, flavors, supplements, cans, bottles,
aseptic boxes, aseptic pouches, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other
ingredients for our beverage products which are delivered to our various third
party bottlers and co-packers.  Depending
on the product, the third party bottlers or packers add filtered water and/or
other ingredients and supplements for the manufacture and packaging of the
finished products into Company-approved containers in accordance with our
formulas.  In the case of sodas and other
carbonated beverages, the bottler/packer adds carbonation to the products as
part of the production process.

We are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase of and
delivery to our third party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which
our beverage products are packaged.

All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party
bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and in Europe,
under separate arrangements with each party. 
The majority of our co-packaging arrangements are on a month-to-month
basis.  However, certain of our
co-packing arrangements are described below:

(a)

Gluek packages certain of our energy drinks. This contract continues until May 2009

to which DFA packages certain of our energy drinks. This contract continues
until March 2010 and is automatically renewed for consecutive one (1) year

(j)

pursuant to which O-AT-KA packages certain of our energy drinks. This contract
continues until December 2010 and is automatically renewable for
consecutive one (1) year periods, subject to mutually agreeable pricing,
unless either party provides notice of cancellation at least ninety (90) days

(120) days prior to the expiration of the initial term.


In certain instances, equipment is purchased by us and installed at the
facilities of our co-packers to enable them to produce certain of our products.  In general, such equipment remains our
property and is to be returned to us upon termination of the packing
arrangements with such co-packers or is amortized over a pre-determined number
of cases that are to be produced at the facilities concerned.

We pack certain products outside of the West Coast region to enable us
to produce products closer to the markets where they are sold and thereby
reduce freight costs.  As distribution
volumes in markets outside of California grow, we continue to secure additional
packing arrangements closer to such markets to further reduce freight costs.

Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise,
particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid
growth, particularly in new markets.  If
we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure
sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to
PET/plastic bottles, aseptic boxes, cans, glass, labels, flavors, juice
concentrates, or supplement ingredients or certain sweeteners, or packing
arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis.
(See “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors”).

Although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or
are terminable upon our request, we believe a short disruption or delay would
not significantly affect our revenues because alternative packing facilities in
the United States with adequate capacity can usually be obtained for many of
our products at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short
time period.  However, there are limited
packing facilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe
with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for certain of our products,
including Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

™

energy
drinks, and Rumba

®,  Samba and Tango energy juice in 8.3-ounce
and/or 16-ounce and/or 24-ounce and/or 24-ounce cap-can and/or 32-ounce and/or
500ml aluminum cans and/or 500ml glass bottles, the Java Monster™ line of
non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks in 15-ounce cans and our aseptic juice
products. A disruption or delay in production of any of such products could
significantly affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing
facilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom or Europe, as the
case may be, with adequate capacity may not be available for such products
either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
period, if at all.  Consequently, a
disruption in production of such products could affect our revenues.  We continue to seek alternative and/or
additional co-packing facilities in the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Europe with adequate capacity for the production of our various
products to minimize the risk of a disruption in production.

During the first quarter of 2009, we ascertained that it was likely
that our west coast copacker of our aseptic juice products would cease to
produce such products in the near future. 
We are endeavoring to secure alternative copacking facilities to replace
that portion of our volume of such products. However, available copacking
capacity for that portion of our volume of such products is limited and we may
not be able to secure sufficient production timely or at all, which would cause
a disruption in our ability to continue to supply that portion of our volume of
such products to customers, either partially or at all.

During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into a distribution
agreement with Cadbury Bebidas, S.A. de C.V. (“Cadbury Bebidas”), for exclusive
distribution by Cadbury Bebidas throughout Mexico, excluding Baja California,
of our Monster Energy® and

Lost® Energy

TM

energy products.  In December 2008, this distributor was
notified of the termination of its distribution agreement on January 25,
2009.  This agreement was terminated on
January 25, 2009.

During
the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Monster Beverages Off-Premise
Distribution Coordination Agreement and the Allied Products Distribution
Coordination Agreement (jointly, the “Off-Premise Agreements”) with
Anheuser-Busch, Inc., a Missouri corporation (“AB”).  Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select
Anheuser-Busch distributors (the “AB Distributors”) distribute and sell, in
markets designated by us, our Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

brands non-alcoholic energy drinks and Rumba®, Samba and Tango brand energy juice,
as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties.

During
the first quarter of 2007, we entered into the On-Premise Distribution
Coordination Agreement (the “On-Premise Agreement”) with AB.  Under the On-Premise Agreement, AB manages


and coordinates the sale,
distribution and merchandising of Monster Energy® energy drinks to on-premise
retailers including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by
us.

During the first quarter of 2007, we entered into a
distribution agreement with Pepsi-QTG Canada, a division of PepsiCo Canada, ULC
(“Pepsi Canada”), for the exclusive distribution by Pepsi Canada throughout
Canada of our

Monster Energy®,

Lost® Energy

TM

and Hansen’s® energy products.  This
agreement was terminated by us effective December 31, 2008.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
the Monster Energy Distribution Coordination Agreement (the “TCCC North
American Coordination Agreement”) with The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”).  Pursuant to the TCCC North American
Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate,
territories in which bottlers from TCCC’s network of partially owned and
independent bottlers, including Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (“CCE”),
Coca-Cola Bottling Company (“CCBC”), CCBCC Operations, LLC (“Consolidated”),
United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC (“United”), and other TCCC independent
bottlers (collectively, the “TCCC North American Bottlers”) will distribute and
sell primarily our Monster Energy® beverages (the “Products”) in the United
States and Canada.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
the Monster Energy Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE was
appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the
Products in portions of twenty-four U.S. states (the “U.S. Territories”). We
may designate additional territories within reasonable proximity to the U.S.
Territories and CCE will use reasonable good faith efforts to add the
additional territories.  During the fourth
quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Canadian Distribution
Agreement with CCBC, pursuant to which CCBC has been appointed to distribute,
directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in Canada, with
performance commencing on January 1, 2009. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
distribution agreements with Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American
Bottlers for the distribution of the Products in various territories within the
United States.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
the Monster Energy International Coordination Agreement (the “TCCC
International Coordination Agreement”) with TCCC.  Pursuant to the TCCC International
Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate,
countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC distributors to distribute and sell
the Products.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
the Monster Energy International Distribution Agreement and the Monster Energy
Belgium Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE has been
appointed to distribute directly, and through certain sub-distributors, the
Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and
Monaco.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into a distribution
agreement with Comercializadora Eloro, S.A., a subsidiary of Grupo Jumex, for
exclusive distribution throughout Mexico, excluding the Baja and Sonora
regions, of our Monster Energy® and Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks as well as select Java Monster

TM

non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks.  Distribution under this agreement commenced January 26,
2009.

Distribution levels vary from state to state and from product to
product.  Certain of our products are
sold in Canada and Mexico.  We also sell
a limited range of our products to distributors outside of the United States,
including in the Caribbean, Central and South America, Japan, Korea, Saudi
Arabia, Hong Kong, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, the
Netherlands, Spain, Belgium,

Luxembourg, Monaco and Sweden. 
Gross sales outside the United States accounted for $96.3 million, $55.7
million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The reclassification of certain military customers from
gross sales to customers within the United States to gross sales to customers
outside the United States, resulted in an increase in gross sales


outside the United States of $14.8 million and $5.5
million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, over
amounts previously reported.

We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering
into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery
distributors with established sales, marketing and distribution
organizations.  Many of our bottlers and
distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda
and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products.  In many cases, such products compete directly
with our products.

During 2008, we continued to expand distribution of our products both
outside of California and outside of the United States.  We expanded our sales force to support and
grow sales, primarily of Monster Energy® drinks, Java Monster

TM

line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks and Monster Hitman Energy Shooter

TM

’s.

Our Blue Sky® products are sold primarily to the health food trade,
natural food chains and mainstream grocery store chains, through specialty
health food distributors.

In September 2007, we relocated our corporate
offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California. In October 2006, we
also entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square
feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California.  This lease commitment provides for minimum
rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal
options.  The monthly rental payments are
$167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by
7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution
space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in
Corona, California.

In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to
acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, which is
currently in escrow.  In August 2008,
we completed the purchase of an additional 1.09 acres of adjacent land for a
purchase price of $1.4 million.  The
properties are located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution
space.  We are reviewing the feasibility
of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels
of land to replace our existing office space.

We have sublet a small
portion of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space on a month to
month basis.  In addition, we continue to
utilize the remaining portion of this space as overflow warehousing for our
main warehouse.  This lease expires in October 2010.
(See “Part I, Item 2 – Properties”).

We
also rent additional warehouse space on a short-term basis from time to time in
public warehouses situated throughout the United States and Canada.

Raw
Materials and Suppliers

The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products
are aluminum cans, glass bottles and PET plastic bottles as well as juice
concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk and cream, the costs of which are subject
to fluctuations. Overall, the prices of aluminum cans, PET plastic bottles,
certain juice concentrates and sugar increased in 2008 as compared to 2007. In
particular, prices of apple concentrate increased materially; although, such
pricing did retreat towards the end of 2008. Furthermore, we have secured a
major part of our 2009 supply of apple concentrate at prices below the overall
prices incurred in 2008. The dairy components in our Java Monster

TM

line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks saw a reduction in 2008 as compared to 2007.  Sucralose prices stayed constant in 2008.


We purchase beverage flavors, concentrates, juices, supplements, cane
sugar, sucrose, sucralose and other sweeteners as well as other ingredients
from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.

Generally, raw materials utilized by us in our business are readily
available from numerous sources. 
However, certain raw materials are manufactured by only one
company.  We purchase sucralose, which is
used alone or in combination with Acesulfame-K in our low-calorie products,
flavors, vitamin blends and herbs from single manufacturers.  Additionally, certain of our cans are only
manufactured by single companies in the United States.

With regard to our Java Monster

TM

line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks, the dairy industry is subject to shortages and higher demand from time
to time which may result in higher prices.

With regard to our fruit juice and juice-drink products, the industry
is subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher
prices and/or lower consumer demand for juices.

Generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their
flavors.  Consequently, we do not have
the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our
concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these
flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice.  We have identified alternative suppliers of
many of the supplements contained in many of our beverages.  However, industry-wide shortages of certain
fruits and fruit juices, and supplements and sweeteners have been, and could
from time to time in the future be, experienced, which could interfere with
and/or delay production of certain of our products.

We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for
certain of our flavors and concentrates as well as to negotiate arrangements
with suppliers which would enable us to obtain access to certain concentrates
or flavor formulas in certain circumstances.  We have been partially successful in these
endeavors.  Additionally, in a limited
number of cases, contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain
regulatory approvals and licenses may limit our ability to enter into
agreements with alternative suppliers and manufacturers and/or distributors.

In connection with the development of new products and flavors,
independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense of product
development, thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively
low cost.  We have historically developed
and successfully introduced new products and flavors and packaging for our
products and intend to continue developing and introducing additional new
beverages and flavors.

Competition

The
beverage industry is highly competitive. 
The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development
of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns.  Our products compete with a wide range of
drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which
have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than
we do.

Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and
effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and
different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing.  We also compete for distributors who will
focus on the sale of our products ahead of those of our competitors, provide
stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail
outlets.  Competitive pressures in the “alternative”,
energy, coffee and “functional” beverage categories could cause our products to
be unable to gain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion,
which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results.


We have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the
energy drink and energy shot categories. 
A number of companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice
cocktails in larger volume packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass bottles,
including Sobe, Snapple Elements, Arizona and Fuse, have added supplements to
their products with a view to marketing their products as “functional” or
energy beverages or as having “functional” benefits.  We believe that many of those products
contain lower levels of supplements and principally deliver refreshment.  In addition, many competitive products are positioned
differently from our energy or “functional” drinks.  Our smoothies and tea lines are positioned
more closely against those products.

We compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum
marketing efforts by multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors,
many of which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and
brands.  Our products compete with all
liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better
financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and
internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc., Cadbury
Schweppes plc, Red Bull Gmbh, Kraft Foods, Inc., Nestle Beverage Company,
Tree Top and Ocean Spray. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily
local in operation.  Our products also
compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store
chains, convenience store chains and club stores.

Our natural sodas compete directly with traditional soda products
including those marketed by TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc. and Cadbury Schweppes plc,
as well as with carbonated beverages marketed by smaller or primarily local
companies such as Jones Soda Co., Clearly Canadian Beverage Company, Crystal
Geyser, J.M. Smucker Company and with private label brands such as those
carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.

Our fruit juice smoothies compete directly with Kern’s, Jumex, Jugos
del Valle and Libby’s Nectars, and V8 Smoothies, as well as with single serve
juice products produced by many competitors. 
Such competitive products are packaged in glass and PET bottles ranging
from 8- to 48-ounces in size and in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans.  The juice content of such competitive
products ranges from 1% to 100%.

Our
apple and other juice products compete directly with Tree Top, Mott’s,
Martinelli’s, Welch’s, Ocean Spray, Tropicana, Minute Maid, Langers, Apple and
Eve, Seneca, Northland, Juicy Juice and also with other brands of apple juice
and juice blends, especially store brands.

Our
energy drinks, including Hansen’s® energy, Diet Red Energy®, Monster Energy®,
Lost® Energy™, Joker Mad Energy™ and Rumba

®

, Samba and Tango energy juice in 8.3-ounce and/or
16-ounce and/or 24-ounce and/or 32-ounce and/or 500ml aluminum cans and/or
500ml glass bottles, and our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™’s compete directly
with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full Throttle, No Fear, Amp, Adrenaline Rush, NOS,
Redline, 180, Red Devil, Rip It, Vitaminenergy, 5-Hour Energy Shot, Redline
Energy Shot, NOS Energy Shot, Rockstar Energy Shot, Full Throttle Quick Shot,
Amp Energy Shot and many other brands. 
TCCC and PepsiCo Inc. also market and/or distribute additional products
in that market segment such as Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew MDX and
Vault.

Our
Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks competes
directly with Starbucks Frappuccino, Starbucks Double Shot, Starbucks Double
Shot Energy Plus Coffee and other Starbucks coffee drinks, Rockstar Roasted,
Caribou Coffee, Cinnabon coffee drinks, Godiva dairy based drinks and Full
Throttle Coffee.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing strategy for all our
beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial
through sampling both in stores and at events. 
We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events
where we sample our products to consumers. 
We utilize “push-pull”


methods to achieve maximum
shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from
consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store promotions and
in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions,
price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme
sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as
cancer research.  Our extreme sports team
endorsements include teams such as the Pro Circuit – Kawasaki Motocross and
Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross and Supercross teams, Robby Gordon
Racing Team, Ken Block Rally Racing Team and the Tech 3 Moto GP Team (new for
2009).  Our individual athlete and/or
personality endorsements include extreme sports figures and athletes such as
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series racer Ricky Carmichael, Moto GP
motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi (new for 2009), television personalities such
as Rob Dyrdek as well as many athletes that compete in other sports related
activities, particularly, the Winter and Summer X-Games, supercross, motocross,
freestyle motocross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing,
snowboarding, BMX, mountain bike downhill racing, snowmobile freestyle,
snowmobile racing, etc.  Our event
endorsements include a wide range of events such as the Monster Energy® Supercross
Series, the AMA Pro Motocross Championship Series and the Vans Warped
Tour. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television
advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to
promote our brands.

We
believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is
differentiation, which entails making our products visually distinctive from
other beverages on the shelves of retailers. 
We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where
practical, endeavor to make them better and unique.  The labels and graphics for many of our
products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and
identification, wherever they may be placed in stores and we will continue to
reevaluate the same from time to time.

Where appropriate we partner with retailers to assist our marketing
efforts.  For example, while we retain
responsibility for the marketing of the Juice Slam® line of children’s
multi-vitamin juice drinks, Costco has undertaken partial responsibility for
the marketing of the Juice Blast® line.

We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by
approximately 24.1% in 2008 compared to 2007. 
As of December 31, 2008, we employed 1,020 employees in sales and
marketing activities, of which 331 were employed on a full-time basis.

Customers

Our
customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club
stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service
beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service
customers.  Gross sales to our various
customer types for the years ended December 2008, 2007 and 2006 are
reflected below.  The allocations below
reflect changes made by us to the categories historically reported.

Our customers include CCE, CCBC, Consolidated, United and other TCCC
North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), AB
Distributors, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore &
Company, Pepsi Canada (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008), Swire
Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and Albertsons.  A decision by any large customer to decrease
amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a
material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of
operations.  The Dr. Pepper Snapple
Group,


Inc., a former customer of the DSD division, accounted
for approximately 13%, 16% and 19% of our net sales for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Our
distribution agreement with the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. was
terminated by us effective November 9, 2008.  The related terminated distributor
territories are now serviced by a combination of TCCC North American Bottlers
and AB Distributors.  Wal-Mart, Inc.
(including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions,
accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 12% of our net sales for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Seasonality

Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat
seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the
highest sales volumes.  The volume of
sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.  Sales of our beverage products may become
increasingly subject to seasonal fluctuations as more sales occur outside of
California with respect to our products. 
However, the energy drink category appears to be less seasonal than
traditional beverages.  As the percentage
of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase,
seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated.  Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected
by other factors, including the introduction of new products, the opening of
new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of
new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of sales of our finished
products and changes in and/or increased advertising, marketing and promotional
expenses.

Intellectual
Property

We own
numerous trademarks that are very important to our business.  Depending
upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or
their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to
have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed
as long as the trademarks are in use.  We also own the copyright in and to
numerous statements made and content appearing on the packaging of our
products.

We own
the Hansen’s®, Monster Energy®, M (stylized)® and the M Monster Energy®
trademarks.  These trademarks are crucial to our business and are
registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in various countries
throughout the world. We own a number of other trademark registrations in a
number of countries around the world including, but not limited to:  Vidration®, A New Kind a Buzz®, Unleash the

and Canada, through our wholly owned subsidiary Blue Sky.


In May 2001,
in connection with the acquisition of the Junior Juice beverage business, we
acquired the Junior Juice® trademark, which is registered in the United States,
through our wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice.

In October 2006,
we acquired the Unbound Energy® trademark which is registered in the United
States. On February 18, 2009, we assigned all of our right, title and
interest in and to the Unbound Energy® trademark to BP Products North America, Inc.

Government Regulation

The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of
our products is subject to various federal and state regulations, including but
not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement
Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act;
various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local
statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale,
safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.  Outside the United States, the production,
distribution and sale of many of our products is also subject to numerous
similar and other statutes and regulations.

California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product
that contains a component listed by the State of California as having been
found to cause cancer or birth defects. 
The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of
having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no
generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not
required.  Consequently, even trace
amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of
warning labels.  Products containing
listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed
to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the
warning requirement.  While none of our
beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot
predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to
the California list in the future.  We
also are unable to predict whether, or to what extent, a warning under this law
would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.

Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that
require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers.  The precise requirements imposed by these
measures vary.  Other deposit, recycling
or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and
localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or
regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal
levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.

Compliance
with Environmental Laws

Our
facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations. 
Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such
compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures,
net income or competitive position.

In
California, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and
to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of
Conservation based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated
and non-carbonated products sold.

In certain other states and Canada
where Hansen’s® products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits
from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective state agencies
based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and
non-carbonated products sold in such states.


Employees

As of December 31,
2008, we employed a total of 1,270 employees of which 564 were employed on a
full-time basis.  Of our 1,270 employees,
we employ 250 in administrative and operational capacities and 1,020 persons in
sales and marketing capacities.

ITEM 1A.               RISK FACTORS

In
addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider
the following risks.  If any of the
following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or
operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The risk factors summarized below are not the
only risks we face.  Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be
immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and/or operating results.

Current global economic
conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of
operations.

The global credit and financial markets have been
experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months, including severely
diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence,
declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty
about economic stability. There can be no assurance that there will not be
further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in
economic conditions. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as
ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our
future business activities. The current adverse global economic conditions and
tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone
spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their
existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties
experienced by our suppliers or customers could result in product delays,
increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable
to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the
credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions, and if the
current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our
business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Increased
competition could hurt our business.

The
beverage industry is highly competitive. 
The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development
of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns.  Our products compete with a wide range of
drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which
have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than
we do.

Important factors affecting our ability to compete
successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer
promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge
products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and
pricing.  Our products compete with all
liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better
financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and
internationally known producers such as The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo Inc.,
Cadbury Schweppes plc, Red Bull Gmbh, Kraft Foods Inc., Nestle Beverage
Company, Tree Top and Ocean Spray.  We
also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in
operation.  Our products also compete
with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains,
convenience store chains, and club stores. 
Our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks
competes directly with Starbucks Frappuccino, Starbucks Double Shot, Starbucks
Double Shot Energy Plus Coffee and other Starbucks coffee drinks, Rockstar
Roasted, Caribou Coffee, Cinnabon coffee drinks, Godiva dairy based drinks and
Full Throttle Coffee.

There
can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our
current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage
industry.  If our revenues decline, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.


We derive a substantial portion of revenues from
our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the “energy drink” category could
adversely affect our operating results.

A substantial
portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in
particular our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Our DSD segment which
comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 90.7% of net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2008.  Any
decrease in the sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could
significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income.
Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in
the energy drink category.  Our energy
drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full Throttle, No Fear, Amp,
Adrenaline Rush, NOS, Redline, 180, Red Devil, Rip It, Vitaminenergy, 5-Hour
Energy Shot, Redline Energy Shot, NOS Energy Shot, Rockstar Energy Shot, Full
Throttle Quick Shot, Amp Energy Shot and many other brands.  A number of companies who market and
distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages, such as 16- and
20-ounce glass bottles, including Sobe, Snapple, Arizona, Fuse, and Vitamin
Water, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their
products as “functional” or energy beverages or as having “functional”
benefits.  In addition, certain large
companies such as TCCC and PepsiCo Inc., market and/or distribute products in
that market segment such as Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew MDX and
Vault.  Competitive pressures in the
energy drink category could impact our revenues or we could experience price
erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse
affect on our business and results.

Change in
consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products.

There is increasing awareness and concern for the health
consequences of obesity.  This may reduce
demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability.

Consumers
are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to
develop and introduce different and innovative beverages.  In order to retain and expand our market
share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative
beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health, although there
can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that
consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future.  Additionally, many of our products are
considered premium products and to maintain market share during recessionary
periods we may have to reduce profit margins which would adversely affect our
results of operations.  Product
lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be
limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences change.  The beverages we currently market are in
varying stages of their lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such
beverages will become or remain profitable for us.  The
beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in
consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such
preferences.  We may be unable to achieve
volume growth through product and packaging initiatives.  We also may be unable to penetrate new
markets.  If our revenues decline,
our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely
affected.

We rely
on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are
unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers
and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or
unavailable to us, our business could suffer.

We do not directly manufacture our products, but
instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract
packers.

In the event of a
disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities
at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
period.  In addition, there are limited
alternative packing facilities in the United States with adequate capacity
and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including Hansen’s® brand
energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, our PET tea line, Hansen’s® Sparkling
beverages in 10.5-ounce sleek cans, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce
PET plastic bottles,  Monster Energy®,
Lost® Energy™, Rumba

Samba, Tango and Joker Mad Energy

energy drinks in 8.3-ounce and/or 16-ounce
and/or 24-ounce


and/or 32-ounce and/or 500ml aluminum cans and/or 500ml glass bottles,

TM

’s and other products.   A disruption or delay in production of any
of such products could significantly affect our revenues from such products as
alternative co-packing facilities in the United States with adequate capacity
may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates,
and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all.  Consequently, a disruption in production of
such products could adversely affect our revenues.

We rely on
bottlers and distributors to distribute our DSD products.  If we are unable to secure such bottlers and
distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our
existing bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer.

We continually
seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with
regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having
established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.  Many of our bottlers and distributors are
affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated
brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic),
including energy drinks.  In many cases,
such products compete directly with our products.

The marketing
efforts of our distributors are important for our success.  If our DSD brands prove to be less attractive
to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract
additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors
do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the
products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

The TCCC North American
Bottlers and AB Distributors are our primary domestic and international
distributors of our Monster Energy® beverages. 
If we are unable to maintain good relationships with the TCCC North
American Bottlers and AB Distributors, or if the TCCC North American Bottlers
and/or AB Distributors do not market and promote our products above the
products of our competitors, sales of our Monster Energy® beverages could be
adversely affected.

Our customers are material to our success.  If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer.

Unilateral
decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery
chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue
carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which
could cause our business to suffer.

The Dr. Pepper
Snapple Group, Inc., a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for
approximately 13%, 16% and 19% of our net sales for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Our
distribution agreement with the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. was
terminated by us effective November 9, 2008.  The related terminated distributor
territories are now serviced by a combination of the TCCC North American
Bottlers and AB Distributors.  If the
TCCC North American Bottlers and/or AB Distributors are generally not as
successful in selling our products as the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
was, this

could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of
operations.

Wal-Mart, Inc.
(including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions,
accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 12% of our net sales for each of the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

A
decision by Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), or any other large customer, to decrease
the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of
operations.


Increases in cost or shortages of
raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business.

The principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, glass bottles
and PET plastic bottles as well as juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk
and cream, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. Overall, the prices
of aluminum cans, PET plastic bottles, certain juice concentrates and sugar
increased in 2008 as compared to 2007. 
In addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to
increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases.  We are uncertain whether the prices of any of
the above or any other raw materials or ingredients will rise in the future and
whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers.  We do not use hedging agreements or
alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient
ingredients or raw materials.

In addition, some of
these raw materials, such as sucralose and certain sizes of cans, are available
from a limited number of suppliers. 
Sucralose, which is used in many of our products including our
low-calorie products, is purchased by us from a single manufacturer. While we
believe that our 2009 sucralose volume allocation will be sufficient to meet
the demand for our products that contain sucralose, we may need to reformulate
certain of those products that contain sucralose with alternative sweetener
systems to avoid an interruption in supply of those products, should the need
arise.

Our
failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect
our business and financial results.

We may not correctly
estimate demand for our products.  Our
ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new
products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly
in new markets.  If we materially
underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient
ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, PET plastic bottles,
cans, glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain sweeteners, or
packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term
basis.  Moreover, industry-wide shortages
of certain juice concentrates, supplements and sweeteners have been and could,
from time to time in the future, be experienced.  Such shortages could interfere with and/or
delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse
effect on our business and financial results. 
We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to
manage this risk.

The costs of packaging supplies
are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass
all or some of such increased costs on to our customers.

Many of our packaging
supplies contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for
packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities
that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as resin for PET
bottles, aluminum for cans, pulp for cartons and/or trays.  These changes in the prices we pay for our
packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product
and supplier.  In some cases, we fix the
prices of certain packaging supplies for a reasonable period. In other cases,
we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies,
including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging
supplies. We do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk.  If the costs of these packaging supplies increase,
we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through
corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We rely upon our ongoing
relationships with our key flavor suppliers. 
If we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key
suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business.

Generally, flavor
suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors.  Consequently, we do not have the list of
ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily
available to


us and we may be unable
to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short
notice. Industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and
sweeteners have been, and could, from time to time in the future, be
experienced.  Such shortages could
interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products.  If we have to replace a flavor supplier, we
could experience temporary disruptions in our ability to deliver products to
our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

Our intellectual property rights
are critical to our success, the loss of such rights could materially adversely
affect our business.

We own numerous
trademarks that are very important to our business.  We also own the copyright in and to a portion
of the content on the packaging of our products.  We regard our trademarks, copyrights, and
similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect
such property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights,
restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement.  Product packages, mechanical designs and
artwork are important to our success and we take action to protect against
imitation of our packaging and trade dress and to protect our trademarks and
copyrights as necessary.  However, there
can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or
misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights.  If we lose some or all of our intellectual
property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected.

Significant changes in government
regulation may hinder sales.

The production,
distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products is subject
to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various
environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and
regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety,
advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. New statutes and
regulations may also be instituted in the future. If a regulatory authority
finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance
with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be
recalled and/or reformulated and/or packaging changed, thus adversely affecting
our financial condition and operations. California law requires that a specific
warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the State of
California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  While none of our beverage products are
required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an
important component of any of our products might be added to the California
list in the future.  We also are unable
to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an
impact on costs or sales of our products.

If we are unable to maintain
brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our
business may suffer.

Our success depends on
our ability to maintain and build brand image for our existing products, new
products and brand extensions. We have no assurance that our advertising,
marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products’
brand image and on consumer preferences. 
Product quality issues, real or imagined, or allegations of product
contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the
affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products.  We may be required from time to time to
recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches.  Product recalls could adversely affect our
profitability and our brand image.  We do
not maintain recall insurance.

While we have to date not
experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no assurance
that we will not experience such litigation in the future.  In the event we were to experience product
liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business
operations could be materially adversely effected.


If we do not maintain sufficient
inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers
in sufficient quantities, or if our retailers’ inventory levels are too high,
our operating results will be adversely affected.

If we do not accurately
anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take
to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our
results of operations may be negatively impacted.  If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we
could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our
shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to
be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate
inventory levels of the desired products. 
If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or
retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products,
which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our
operating results.

If we are not able to retain the
full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our
operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable
replacements.

Our business is
dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management.  We do not maintain key person life insurance
for any members of our senior management. 
The loss of services of either Mr. Sacks, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, Mr. Schlosberg, President and Chief Financial Officer,
or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our
business until suitable replacements can be found.  There may be a limited number of personnel
with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to
locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.

Weather could adversely affect
our supply chain and demand for our products.

With regard to fruit
juice, fruit juice concentrates and natural flavors, the beverage industry is
subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher prices
and/or the nonavailability of any of such items.  Sales of our products may also be influenced
to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate,
particularly in areas outside of California. 
Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our
beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Potential changes in accounting
practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results.

We cannot predict the
impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our
financial results.  New accounting
standards could be issued that could change the way we record revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities.  These
changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported
earnings.  Increases in direct and
indirect income tax rates could affect after tax income.   Equally, increases in indirect taxes
(including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage
containers) could affect our products’ affordability and reduce our sales.

Volatility of stock price may
restrict sale opportunities.

Our
stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder
expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our
competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections
by the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other
factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
We may be unable to achieve analysts’ earnings forecasts, which may be
based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products,
certain of which are more profitable than others.  There can be no assurance that the Company
will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales. As a result, our stock
price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to
sell our stock at attractive prices.


During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, our stock price high was $45.63
and stock price low was $20.52.

Provisions in our organizational
documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such
changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.

Our organizational
documents may limit changes in control. 
Furthermore, as of February 6, 2009, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg
together may be deemed to control a maximum of 22.1% of our outstanding common
stock.  Consequently, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg
could exercise significant control on matters submitted to a vote of our
stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents
and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even
though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders.

Our cash flow may not be
sufficient to fund our long term goals.

We may be unable to
generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and
general operating activities.  In
addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the
activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth.

Our investments in marketable securities are
subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these
investments.

At
December 31, 2008, we had $256.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and
$118.7 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically
invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and
municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes
and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria.
Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market
and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage
defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused
credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment
portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Certain of our short-term investments and all of our long-term
investments are comprised of municipal or educational related or other public
body notes with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”). The
majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and
are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance
companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals,
usually every 7 to 35 days. 
Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an
auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic
auctions.  At December 31, 2008, we
held auction rate securities with a face value of $112.5 million.  Subsequent to December 31, 2008, we
redeemed $8.1 million of auction rate securities at par, which are included in
short-term investments in our consolidated financial statements.  During the year ended December 31, 2008,
a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. We
determined that there was an impairment of our auction rate securities of $14.9
million, resulting in a fair value of $89.6 million, which is included in
long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements.  We determined that of the $14.9 million
impairment of our auction rate securities, $14.4 million was deemed
temporary.  This amount has been
recorded, net of a tax benefit of $5.7 million, as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, we
determined that $0.5 million of the impairment was other-than-temporary and
recorded a charge to interest and other income, net in our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008.  There is no assurance that auctions on the
remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. The
auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or
buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors.
In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security
in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a


default
rate that is above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for
which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their
predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until
their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature
or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability
to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate
securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, certain of these
securities have been classified as long-term investments in our consolidated
financial statements.  We anticipate that
due to the higher interest rates now payable on certain of these securities and
for other reasons, certain issuers are likely to take steps to refinance their
notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the
higher interest rates now payable on such securities.

If
the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their
debts and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit
ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record additional
impairment charges on these investments. If uncertainties in the credit and
capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate
securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments
on these investments. We may be required to wait until market stability is
restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying
notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments’ recorded value. (See “Part II,
Item 7A — Qualitative And Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks” and “Part II,
Item 8, Note 3 — Investments” in our consolidated financial statements).

If we fail to maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in
our Company could be materially and adversely affected.

We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes
described in “Part II, Item 9A — Controls and Procedures.”  If we fail to do so, our business, results of
operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially
harmed.

Litigation or legal proceedings
could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our
financial results.

We
are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal
proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud,
unfair business practices and false advertising, breach of contract claims,
securities actions and shareholder derivative actions.  Material legal proceedings are described more
fully in “Part I, Item 3 — Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8,
Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K.

Defending
these proceedings will result in significant ongoing expenditures and the
continued diversion of our management’s time and attention from the operation
of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business
operations.  Our failure to successfully
defend or settle any of these litigations or legal proceedings could result in
liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial conditions, revenue and profitability,
and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.

Operations outside the United
States expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international
markets.

Our gross sales to
customers outside of the United States were approximately 8.2% of consolidated
gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 and our growth strategy
includes expanding our international business. We face and will continue to
face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including:
economic or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on
or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States,
including


possible taxes or
withholding obligations on any repatriations; and the imposition of tariffs or
trade restrictions.  These risks could
have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive
basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.  Also, our operations outside of the United
States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in
staffing and managing local operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud
or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially
adverse tax consequences.  We are also exposed
to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses,
profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. We have not used instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks
and are not protected against foreign currency fluctuations.  As a result, our reported earnings may be
affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable
impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time.

We must successfully maintain
and/or upgrade our information technology systems.

We rely on various
information technology systems to manage our operations. During the fourth
quarter of 2008, we resolved to commence the implementation of the SAP
enterprise resource planning system to replace our legacy systems.  The implementation is scheduled to be
completed in the first quarter of 2010. This implementation subjects us to take
on inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these
systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders,
potential disruption of the internal control structure, substantial capital
expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or
difficulties in transitioning to a new system. 
The implementation of this system may not result in productivity
improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all.
Any information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and
appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business and
operations.

PROPERTIES

In September 2007, we relocated our corporate
offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California. In October 2006, we
also entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square
feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California.  This lease commitment provides for minimum
rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal
options.  The monthly rental payments are
$167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by
7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution
space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in
Corona, California.

In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to
acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, which is
currently in escrow.  In August 2008,
we completed the purchase of an additional 1.09 acres of adjacent land for a
purchase price of $1.4 million.  These
properties are located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution
space.  We are reviewing the feasibility
of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels
of land to replace our existing office space.

We have sublet a small portion of our previous office,
warehouse and distribution space on a month to month basis.  In addition, we continue to utilize the
remaining portion of this space as overflow for our main warehouse.  This lease expires in October 2010.


We also rent additional
warehouse space on a short-term basis from time to time in public warehouses
situated throughout the United States and Canada.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In
August 2006, HBC filed a lawsuit against National Beverage Company, Shasta
Beverages, Inc., Newbevco Inc. and Freek’N Beverage Corp. (collectively “National”)
seeking an injunction and damages for trademark infringement, trademark
dilution, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices based on National’s
unauthorized use of HBC’s valuable and distinctive Monster Energy® trade dress
in connection with a line of energy drinks it launched under the “Freek” brand
name.  In June 2007, the parties
entered into a confidential settlement agreement resolving the parties’
disputes in the litigation.  National
subsequently repudiated the settlement agreement and HBC responded by filing a
motion in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California to enforce the terms of the confidential settlement agreement.  On August 14, 2007, the United States
District Court entered an Order enforcing the settlement agreement and
permanently enjoining National from manufacturing, distributing, shipping,
marketing, selling and offering to sell “Freek” energy drinks in containers
using the original “Freek” trade dress that was subject to the District Court’s
preliminary injunction.  National
appealed the District Court’s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
which heard oral arguments on December 11, 2008.  No decision has been issued on the appeal.

In
August 2006, HBC filed a civil action in the Federal Court of Australia,
Victoria District Registry, against Bickford’s Australia (Pty) Limited and Meak
(Pty) Ltd. (collectively “Bickfords”), in which HBC sought an injunction
restraining Bickfords from selling or offering for sale or promoting in
Australia any energy drink or beverage under the MONSTER ENERGY™ or MONSTER™
marks or any similar marks, and further sought damages and costs.  Bickfords cross-claimed seeking an order to
restrain HBC from selling, offering for sale or promoting in Australia any
drink product under the Monster Energy or Monster trademarks or any similar
trademarks, and for costs.  In December 2008,
the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement resolving the
parties’ disputes in the litigation. 
Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, Bickfords will cease
all use of the Monster and Monster Energy marks in Australia (after depletion
of its existing inventory) and will assign to HBC all trademark applications
and registrations which consist of or include the MONSTER ENERGY™ and MONSTER™
marks it has lodged throughout the world, including those lodged in Australia,
New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia.

In September 2006,
Christopher Chavez purporting to act on behalf of himself and a class of
consumers yet to be defined filed an action in the Superior Court, of the State
of California, City and County of San Francisco, against the Company and its
subsidiaries for unfair business practices, false advertising, violation of
California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation
alleging that the Company misleadingly labels its Blue Sky beverages as
originating in and/or being canned under the authority of a company located in
Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Defendants removed
this Superior Court action to the United States Court for the Northern District
of California under the Class Action Fairness Act, and filed motions for
dismissal or transfer.  On June 11,
2007, the United States District Court, Northern District of California granted
the Company’s motion to dismiss Chavez’s complaint with prejudice.

On June 21, 2007, Chavez filed an appeal with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the Court heard oral arguments
on January 14, 2009.  No decision
has been issued on the appeal.

In
January 2007, the Company’s distributor for the Riverside County and San
Bernardino County, California territories, Gate City Beverage Company (“Gate
City”), notified the Company of its intention to sell its business and
requested the Company consent to the assignment of the distribution agreement
with the Company.  The Company declined its consent and exercised its
contractual right to terminate the Gate City distribution agreement upon thirty
days prior written notice.  Gate City
threatened to take “appropriate action” against the Company and third parties
for what it contended was


an
improper termination of the distribution agreement.  The Company denied Gate City’s assertion
regarding improper termination of the applicable distribution agreement.  On February 6, 2008, Gate City filed a
demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association to be held in
Orange County, California, claiming damages in an amount exceeding $5.0
million, plus attorneys’ fees and costs. 
The Company disputes liability and is defending the claim. The
arbitration hearing has been set for May 2009.

On
July 3, 2008, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court for the
State of California for Los Angeles County against St. Paul Mercury Insurance
Company (“St. Paul”) due to St. Paul’s failure to reimburse the Company for
certain costs and expenses incurred and paid by the Company for and in
connection with the investigation and defense of various proceedings relating
to certain stock option grants made by the Company, including Special Committee
investigation costs (the “St. Paul Complaint”).   The Company purchased from St. Paul a
directors and officers insurance policy that the Company contends covered such
expenses during the pertinent time period.  
St. Paul has reimbursed the Company for certain of the costs and
expenses associated with the Company’s successful defense against the subject
proceedings, but has refused to pay the remainder of the limits of its
policy.  The St. Paul Complaint alleges
that St. Paul is liable to the Company for the difference.  The Company seeks damages arising from St.
Paul’s breach of the policy, punitive damages, and reimbursement of the
attorneys’ fees expended in the investigation and litigation.  On August 1, 2008, St. Paul removed the
lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Central District of
California.  On August 8, 2008, St.
Paul answered the St. Paul Complaint and denied that it has any further
responsibility to the Company beyond the amount for which it had previously
reimbursed the Company.  Motions for
summary judgment on certain major issues in the litigation have been filed by
the parties.  The Court has scheduled a
hearing on those motions for March 2009. 
A trial has been preliminarily scheduled in this litigation for November 2009.

On July 11, 2008, the Company
initiated an action against Citigroup Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
and Citi Smith Barney, in the United States District Court, Central District of
California, for violations of federal securities laws and the Investment
Advisors Act, arising out of the Company’s purchase of auction rate
securities.  The Court granted defendants’
motion to compel arbitration before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(“FINRA”).  The matter is now proceeding
before FINRA.

On August 28, 2008, the Company initiated an action against
Oppenheimer Holdings Inc., Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., and Oppenheimer
Asset Management Inc. in the United States District Court, Central District of
California, for violations of federal securities laws and the Investment
Advisors Act, arising out of the Company’s purchase of auction rate
securities.  The defendants answered the
complaint on October 14, 2008 denying the allegations set forth
therein.  The Oppenheimer action was
deemed a related case to the Company’s action against Citigroup Inc. (described
above).  After the Court granted
defendants’ motion to compel arbitration in the Citigroup Inc. case, the
Company stipulated to arbitration before FINRA and the matter is now proceeding
before FINRA.

Securities Litigation

- On September 11, 2008, a federal
securities class action complaint styled

Cunha v. Hansen Natural
Corp., et al.

was filed in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California (the “District Court”). On September 17,
2008, a second federal securities class action complaint styled

Brown v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al.

was also filed in the
District Court.

Both
actions, filed by single individual shareholders purportedly on behalf of a
class of purchasers of the Company’s stock during the period May 23, 2007
through November 8, 2007 (the “Class Period”), name as defendants the
Company, Rodney C. Sacks, and Hilton H. Schlosberg. The allegations of both
complaints are substantially similar. Plaintiffs allege violations of Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that during the Class Period,
the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements that failed to
disclose that: (i) the Company’s second quarter sales results were “materially
impacted by inventory loading as customers were induced to purchase more
product before the Company


raised
its prices in its Monster Energy® drink line and its Java Monster™ drink line”;
(ii) the Company was “experiencing declining sales in its non-core drink
lines”; (iii) the Company was “experiencing production shortfalls with its
Java Monster drink line”; and (iv) as a result of the foregoing,
defendants “lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the
Company and its prospects.” The complaints seek an unspecified amount of
damages.

The
New Jersey Carpenters Pension Fund and the Structural Ironworkers Local Union
#1 Pension Fund filed motions on November 10, 2008 for consolidation of
the actions and for appointment of Lead Plaintiff and Lead Counsel.  A hearing on the motions is expected in March 2009.  If a motion for consolidation is granted,
defendants must respond within forty-five days from the date of service of any
consolidated complaint or the designation of one complaint as the operative
complaint in the consolidated class actions.  If a motion for
consolidation is denied, then defendants must respond to the complaints within
forty-five days from the date on which the denial of such motion is entered on
the Court’s docket.

Derivative Litigation

- On September 15, 2008, a derivative
complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
Riverside, styled

Stueve v. Sacks, et al.

On October 15,
2008, a second derivative complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, styled

Merckel v.
Sacks, et al.

The derivative suits were each brought, purportedly on
behalf of the Company, by a shareholder of the Company who made no prior demand
on the Company’s Board of Directors.

Pursuant
to a stipulation among the parties that was so ordered by the Court on November 2,
2008, the

Stueve

action was voluntarily dismissed
in its entirety and without prejudice.

The

Merckel

complaint names as
defendants certain current and former officers, directors, and employees of the
Company and HBC, including Rodney C. Sacks, Hilton H. Schlosberg, Harold C.
Taber, Jr., Benjamin M. Polk, Norman C. Epstein, Mark S. Vidergauz, Sydney
Selati, Thomas J. Kelly, Mark J. Hall, and Kirk S. Blower, as well as the
administrator of the Estate of Michael B. Schott and Hilrod Holdings,
L.P.   The Company is named as a nominal defendant.  The factual
allegations of the complaint are substantially similar to those set forth in
the two securities class action complaints described above.  The complaint
also alleges, among other things, that between May 2007 and the date of
the filing of the complaint, the defendants directed the Company to issue a
series of improper statements concerning its business prospects. The complaint
further alleges that while the Company’s shares were purportedly artificially
inflated because of those improper statements, certain defendants sold Company
stock while in possession of material non-public information regarding the
Company’s “true” business prospects. The complaint asserts various causes of
action, including breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of
fiduciary duty, violation of Cal. Corp. Code §§ 25402 and 25403 for insider
selling, and unjust enrichment. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of damages
to be paid to the Company, adoption of corporate governance reforms, and
equitable and injunctive relief.

On
December 4, 2008, Plaintiff in the

Merckel

action
filed a motion to consolidate that action with another lawsuit involving
similar allegations filed in the Central District of California, styled

Dislevy v. Sacks, et al.

The

Dislevy

complaint, which names some but
not all of the defendants in the

Merckel

action
has not been served.  A hearing on the
motion to consolidate is expected for March 2009.  If the motion to consolidate is granted,
defendants must respond within 45 days after the filing and service of a
consolidated amended complaint.  If the
motion to consolidate is denied, defendants must respond to the

Merckel

complaint within 45 days from entry of the order
denying the motion or from the filing of any amended complaint, whichever is
later.

On
February 17, 2009 Plaintiff in the

Merckel

action
voluntarily dismissed The Estate of Michael B. Schott from the action without
prejudice.


Although the ultimate outcome of these matters
cannot be determined with certainty, the Company believes that the complaints
are without merit. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these
lawsuits.

In
addition to the above matters, the Company is subject to litigation from time
to time in the normal course of business, including claims from terminated
distributors.  Although it is not
possible to predict the outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to
the Company and after consultation with counsel, management believes that such
litigation in the aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 6.                  SELECTED
FINANCIAL DATA

The
consolidated statements of operations data set forth below with respect to each
of the years ended December 31, 2004 through 2008 and the balance sheet
data as of December 31, for the years indicated, are derived from our
audited consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction
with those financial statements and notes thereto, and with the Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included as Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


¹Includes
$14.3 million, $1.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred
revenue attributable to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into
with certain distributors.

²Includes
$118.1 million, $15.3 million and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to expenditures attributable to the
costs associated with terminating existing distributors.

³Includes
($0.2) million, $9.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to professional service fees, net of
insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock
option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters.

*Gross
sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating
performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the
United States of America (“GAAP”), and should not be used alone as an indicator
of operating performance in place of net sales. 
Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our
internal reporting requirements. 
However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating
performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson
performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance.  The use of gross sales allows evaluation of
sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask
certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales
allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance.  Gross sales may not be realized in the form
of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from
payments received from customers (See “Part II, Item 7 — Results of
Operations”).

Our Business

Overview

We develop, market, sell and distribute “alternative”
beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks
and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and “functional” drinks,
non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks,
Junior Juice® juices, Junior Juice Water and flavored sparkling beverages under
the Hansen’s® brand name.  We also
develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand
names: Monster Energy®; Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™; Lost® Energy™ and Joker
Mad Energy™ brand names as well as Rumba®, Samba and Tango brand energy
juices.  We also market, sell and
distribute the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. Additionally,
we market, sell and distribute natural sodas, premium natural sodas with
supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy
drinks under the Blue Sky® brand name. In July 2008, we began to market,
sell and distribute enhanced water beverages under the Vidration™ brand name.

We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose
principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal
products comprise juice based and soda beverages.  The DSD segment develops, markets and sells
products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the
Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to
retailers.

Our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks include
Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy®
drinks (introduced in August 2003), Monster Energy® Assault® energy drinks
(introduced in September 2004), Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks (introduced in August 2005),
Monster Energy® M-80

TM

energy
drinks (introduced in March 2007, named “RIPPER” in certain countries),
Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks (introduced in November 2007)
and Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007).


A substantial portion of
our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.  Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues
and net income. Our DSD segment represented 90.7%, 89.5% and 84.9% of our net
sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  Competitive pressure in
the “energy drink” category could adversely affect our operating results. (See “Part I,
Item 1A — Risk Factors”).

Our sales and marketing strategy for all our
beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial
through sampling both in stores and at events. 
We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events
where we sample our products to consumers. 
We utilize “push-pull” methods to achieve maximum shelf and display
space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our
products, including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of
point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions,
competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures,
coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as cancer
research.  Our extreme sports team
endorsements include teams such as the Pro Circuit — Kawasaki Motocross and
Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross and Supercross teams, Robby Gordon
Racing Team, Ken Block Rally Racing Team and the Tech 3 Moto GP Team (new for
2009).  Our individual athlete and/or
personality endorsements include extreme sports figures and athletes such as
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series racer Ricky Carmichael, Moto GP
motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi (new for 2009), television personalities such
as Rob Dyrdek as well as many athletes that compete in other sports related
activities, particularly, the Winter and Summer X-Games, supercross, motocross,
freestyle motocross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing,
snowboarding, BMX, mountain biking, snowmobile freestyle, snowmobile racing,
etc.  Our event endorsements include a
wide range of events such as the Monster Energy® Supercross Series, the AMA Pro
Motocross Championship Series and the Vans Warped Tour. In-store posters,
outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price
promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands.

We believe that one of the keys to success in the
beverage industry is differentiation, such as making Hansen’s® products
visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers.  We review our products and packaging on an
ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and
unique.  The labels and graphics for many
of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility
and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue
to reevaluate the same from time to time.

During
2008, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our
markets.  In particular, we continued to
focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category
generally described as the “alternative” beverage category, with particular
emphasis on energy type drinks.

During
the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Off-Premise Agreements with
AB.  Under the Off-Premise Agreements,
select AB Distributors distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s
Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

brands non-alcoholic energy drinks and Rumba®, Samba and Tango brand energy juice,
as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
the Monster Energy Distribution Coordination Agreement (the “TCCC North
American Coordination Agreement”) with The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”).  Pursuant to the TCCC North American
Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in


the
future may designate, territories in which bottlers from TCCC’s network of
partially owned and independent bottlers, including Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.
(“CCE”), Coca-Cola Bottling Company (“CCBC”), CCBCC Operations, LLC (“Consolidated”),
United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC (“United”), and other TCCC independent
bottlers (collectively, the “TCCC North American Bottlers”) will distribute and
sell primarily our Monster Energy® beverages (the “Products”) in the United
States and Canada.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
the Monster Energy Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE was
appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the
Products in portions of twenty-four U.S. states (the “U.S. Territories”). We
may designate additional territories within reasonable proximity to the U.S.
Territories and CCE will use reasonable good faith efforts to add the
additional territories.  During the
fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Canadian
Distribution Agreement with CCBC, pursuant to which CCBC has been appointed to
distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in
Canada, with performance commencing on January 1, 2009.  In addition, during the fourth quarter of
2008, we entered into distribution agreements with Consolidated, United and
other TCCC North American Bottlers for the distribution of Products in various
territories within the United States.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
the Monster Energy International Coordination Agreement (the “TCCC
International Coordination Agreement”) with TCCC.  Pursuant to the TCCC International
Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate,
countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC distributors to distribute and sell
the Products.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
the Monster Energy International Distribution Agreement and the Monster Energy
Belgium Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE has been
appointed to distribute directly and through certain sub-distributors the
Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and
Monaco.

Pursuant
to the new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain
distributors as discussed above, net amounts of $113.0 million and $21.0
million from such distributors, relating to the cost of terminating certain of
our prior distributors, were recorded for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. Such amounts have been accounted for as deferred
revenue and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of
the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. Distributor
receivables related to these new and/or amended distribution agreements totaled
$90.7 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Revenue recognized was $14.3 million, $1.9 million and $0.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  Included in the $14.3
million of revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008, is
$11.6 million related to the acceleration of deferred revenue balances
associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the
fourth quarter of 2008.

We
incurred termination costs to certain of our prior distributors amounting to
$118.1 million, $15.3 million and $12.7 million in aggregate for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such termination
costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Accrued distributor
terminations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2008 and 2007 (representing termination costs not paid to our prior
distributors prior to the end of the fiscal year) were $102.3 million and $4.3
million, respectively.  In addition,
inventory returned to us by certain of our prior terminated distributors
resulted in a reduction of gross sales of approximately $9.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2008.

As discussed under Review of Historic Stock
Option Granting Practices in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, included in our Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and Item 2 “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, included
in our Form 10-Q for the quarter


ended March 31, 2007, a
special committee of our Board of Directors concluded its review of our stock
option grants and granting practices.  In
connection with this review, and with respect to related litigation and other
related matters, we incurred professional service fees, net of insurance
proceeds, of ($0.2) million, $9.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006:


includes terminations in Canada and Mexico


net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements

We
again achieved record gross sales of $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2008.  The increase in gross sales in
2008 was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing
products, particularly our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and to increased
sales by volume of our Java Monster

TM

line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks. Gross sales for the year ended December 31,
2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of
2007 for all of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and
our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1,
2008.  We estimate that gross sales for
the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a
result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price
increases.  We did not limit the amount
of purchases our customers could execute at our existing 2007 fourth quarter
prices.

Our
percentage increase in gross sales was 15.3%, 47.3% and 67.6% for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  We believe our growth rate decline was
attributable to the decline of the overall growth rates in the markets in which
we operate, and more recently, to general economic conditions.  Consumer spending habits, including spending
for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things,
prevailing economic conditions, inflation, levels of employment, salaries and
wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and gas costs,
income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of
economic conditions.  In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may
be influenced by consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt
levels. A continued or incremental slowdown in the U.S. economy, an uncertain
economic


outlook or an expanded
credit crisis could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits
resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual
basis.  During 2008, there was significant
deterioration in the global financial markets and economic environment, which
we believe negatively impacted consumer spending at many retailers for our
products. In response to this, we have taken steps to increase opportunities to
profitably drive sales and to operate our business more efficiently. If these
adverse economic trends worsen, or if our efforts to counteract the impacts of
these trends are not sufficiently effective, there could be a negative impact
on our financial performance and position in future fiscal periods. For further
discussion of the risks to us regarding general economic conditions (See “Part I,
Item 1A — Risk Factors”).

Gross
sales shipped outside of California represented 77%, 73% and 69% of our gross
sales, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $96.3 million,
$55.7 million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Such sales were approximately 8.2%, 5.4% and 3.5%
of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  The reclassification of
certain military customers from gross sales to customers within the United
States to gross sales to customers outside the United States, resulted in an increase
in gross sales outside the United States of $14.8 million and $5.5 million for
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, over amounts
previously reported.

Our
customers are primarily retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club
stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service
beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers.
Gross sales to our various customer types for 2008, 2007 and 2006 are reflected
below.  The allocations below reflect
changes made by the Company to the categories historically reported.

Our customers include CCE, CCBC, Consolidated, United and other TCCC
North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), AB
Distributors, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore &
Company, Pepsi Canada (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008),
Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and Albertsons.  A decision by any large customer to decrease
amounts purchased from the Company or to cease carrying our products could have
a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results
of operations.  Dr. Pepper Snapple
Group, Inc., a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for
approximately 13%, 16% and 19% of our net sales for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Our
distribution agreement with the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. was
terminated by us effective November 9, 2008.  The related terminated distributor
territories are now serviced by a combination of TCCC North American Bottlers
and AB Distributors.  Wal-Mart, Inc.
(including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions,
accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 12% of our net sales for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We
continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and
introduction of new products and flavors.


Value Drivers of our Business

We believe that the key value drivers of our business
include the following:

·

Profitable Growth

— We believe “functional”, “better for
you” brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad
consumer base, drive profitable growth. 
We continue to broaden our family of brands.  In particular, we are expanding our specialty
beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers.  We are focused on maintaining profit margins.
We believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and channeling strategies
help achieve profitable growth.  We are
implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth.

·

Cost Management

— The principal focus of cost management
will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction.  One key area of focus is to decrease raw
material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a
percentage of net operating revenues. 
Another key area of focus is the reduction of inventory days on hand.

·

Efficient Capital Structure

— Our capital structure is intended to
optimize our cost of capital.  We believe
our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low
effective cost and low overall costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage.

We
believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being
contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in: (1) maintaining
our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time
through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing
our cost of capital.  The ultimate
measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results
of operations.

Gross
and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income
per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers.  These measurements will continue to be a key
management focus in 2009 and beyond.

(

See “Part II,
Item 7 — Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008
Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007”).

As of December 31,
2008, the Company had working capital of $374.0 million compared to $187.3
million as of December 31, 2007. 
The overall increase in working capital was primarily attributable to
the transfer of our investments from long-term instruments to short-term
instruments (See “Part II, Item 8, Note 3 — Investments” in our
consolidated financial statements).  For
the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash provided by operating
activities was approximately $199.5 million as compared to $135.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007. 
Principal uses of cash flows are repurchases of our common stock,
purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets,
acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks.  Payment of accrued distributor terminations,
purchases of our common stock, accounts payable and income taxes payable are
expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working
capital funds. (See “Part II, Item 7 — Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

Opportunities, Challenges and
Risks

Looking forward, our management has identified certain
challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our
Company.  Uncertainty and volatility in domestic
and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability
of our industry and our Company. 
Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the
successful marketing and purchase of our products.  Increases in consumer and regulatory
awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles
continues to represent a challenge.  We
recognize


that
obesity is a complex and serious public health problem.  Our commitment to consumers begins with our
broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages,
juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks.  We continuously strive to meet changing
consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety.

Our
historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different
and innovative beverages.  Our future
success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and
introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no
assurance of our ability to do so.  In
order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and
introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of
quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property
protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences
and shifts in consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge
such preferences.

In
addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future
financial results include, but are not limited to:

·

the impact of the slowing economy in the United States
and other countries in which we operate;

·

maintenance of our brand image and product quality;

·

profitable expansion and growth of our family of
brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 —  Business - Competition and Sales and
Marketing”);

·

restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties
or tariffs; changes in government regulations;

·

protection of our existing intellectual property
portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new
and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines;

·

limitations on available quantities of certain package
containers such as the 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can, and copacking
availability;

·

the imposition of additional restrictions.

(See “Part I,
Item 1A — Risk Factors”) for additional information about risks and uncertainties
facing our Company.

We
believe that the following opportunities exist for us:

·

growth potential for the “alternative” beverage
category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks
and teas, juices and juice drinks and enhanced waters;

·

new product introductions intended to contribute to
higher profitability;

·

premium packages intended to generate strong revenue
growth;

·

significant package, pricing and channel opportunities
to maximize profitable growth;

·

proper positioning to capture industry growth; and

·

broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in
both domestic and international markets.

*

Gross sales, although used
internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not
be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance
with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating
performance in place of net sales. 
Additionally, gross sales may not be


comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been
defined by our internal reporting requirements. 
However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating
performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson
performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance.  The use of gross sales allows evaluation of
sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask
certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales
allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance.  Gross sales may not be realized in the form
of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from
payments received from customers.  (See”Part II,
Item 6 — Selected Financial Data”).

**

Although the expenditures
described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet
GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP
presentation requirements.  Additionally,
the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to
similar items presented by other companies. 
The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an
evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and
illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and
other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities.

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31,
2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007

Gross Sales.*

Gross sales were $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an
increase of approximately $157.1 million, or 15.3% higher than gross sales of
$1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The increase in gross sales was primarily
attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case
for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™
line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007),
as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™
(introduced in September 2008), Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks
(introduced in December 2007) and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy
drinks (introduced in November 2007). 
To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to
increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration®
vitamin enhanced water (introduced in July 2008).  In addition, the increase in gross sales was
partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related
to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of
our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase
in gross sales was partially offset by inventory returned to us by certain of
our terminated distributors of approximately $9.7 million in the fourth quarter
of 2008, decreased sales by volume of juice blends, Lost Energy® brand energy
drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Unbound Energy® brand
energy drinks (introduced in October 2006), Rumba® brand energy juice
(introduced in December 2004), Hansen’s® energy drinks and smoothies in
cans. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a
price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our
Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ line
of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1,
2008.  We estimate that gross sales for
the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a
result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases.
Promotional and other allowances were $149.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2008, an increase of $27.8 million, or 22.9% higher than promotional and other
allowances of $121.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to
12.6% from 11.8% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  As a result, the
percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
higher than the percentage increase in net sales.

*Gross
sales — see definition above.

Net Sales.

Net sales were $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2008, an increase of approximately $129.3 million, or 14.3% higher than net
sales of $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The increase in net sales was primarily
attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case
for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™
line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain
new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™, Monster Energy® MIXXD™
energy drinks and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks.  To a lesser extent, the increase in


net sales was attributable to increased sales
by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of

Vidration® vitamin enhanced water

. In addition,
the increase in net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of
$11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue
balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the
fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased
sales by volume of Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, juice blends, iced teas,
Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks, Hansen’s® energy drinks and Rumba® brand
energy juice.  Net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during
the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in
16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks, effective January 1, 2008. 
We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008
were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers
in advance of such price increases.

Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were
102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of
4.2 million cases or 4.3% higher than case sales of 98.5 million cases for the
year ended December 31, 2007. The overall average net sales price per case
increased to $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008 or 9.6% higher
than the average net sales price per case of $9.19 for the year ended December 31,
2007.  The increase in the average net
sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case
sales derived from higher priced products as well as the price increases for
our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans effective January 1,
2008, price increases for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 24-ounce
cans effective July 1, 2007 and price increases in our Java Monster™ line
of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. In
addition, the increase in the average net sales price per case was partially
attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the
acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our
prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Net sales for the DSD segment were $937.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $128.1
million, or 15.8% higher than net sales of $809.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2007.  The increase in net sales was
primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price
per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java
Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of
certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™, Monster Energy®
MIXXD™ energy drinks, Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks and Vidration®
vitamin enhanced water.  In addition, the
increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially attributable to the
recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the
deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors
terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by
volume of Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks
and Rumba® brand energy juice.

Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $95.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately
$1.2 million, or 1.3% higher than net sales of $94.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to

increased sales by volume of apple juice and aseptic
juices.  The increase in net sales was
partially offset by decreased sales by volume of juice blends, iced teas and Hansen’s®
energy drinks.  Changes in pricing within
the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2008.

Gross Profit.**

*
Gross profit was $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an
increase of approximately $70.8 million, or 15.1% higher than the gross profit
of $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales
increased slightly to 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The increase in net sales contributed to the
increase in gross profit dollars.  The
increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially
attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the
acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our
prior distributors terminated


in
the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net
sales was also attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products which
have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. Such
increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by
an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java
Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks that have lower gross
profit margins than our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and to an increase
in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain
containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly
apple juice concentrate as well as increased trade marketing agreement costs.

***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since
some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in
cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such
costs within another line item such as operating expenses.

Operating Expenses

.   Total operating expenses were
$375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of
approximately $138.2 million, or 58.3% higher than total operating expenses of
$237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total operating
expenses as a percentage of net sales was 36.3% for the year ended December 31,
2008, compared to 26.2% for year ended December 31, 2007.  The increase in operating expenses in dollars
was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the
costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent,
the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increased out-bound
freight and warehouse costs of $5.9 million primarily due to increased volume
of shipments and increased freight rates, increased expenditures of $17.9
million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $4.1 million
for sampling programs, increased expenditures of $3.1 million for commissions
and royalties, increased expenditures of $1.5 million for in-store demos and
increased payroll expenses of $7.3 million (including a $3.7 million increase
in stock-based compensation).  The
increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by decreased
expenditures of $6.3 million for professional services costs, including legal
and accounting fees and decreased expenditures of $3.8 million for merchandise
displays. The individual increases above include costs of $10.7 million, or 1.0%
of net sales, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy® brand in Europe for
the year ended December 31, 2008. 
Included in legal and accounting fees are professional service fees, net
of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of
stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related
matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $118.1
million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing
distributors; and (ii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of
insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively in connection with our special investigation of
stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other
related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.9% and 23.4% for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Contribution Margin.

Contribution margin for the DSD
segment was $216.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a
decrease of approximately $65.5 million, or 23.3% lower than contribution
margin of $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The decrease in the contribution margin for
the DSD segment was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million
relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. The
decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was offset by increased
sales of our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks,
the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as
sales of certain new products such as the Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™,
Monster MIXXD™ energy drinks and Monster Heavy Metal™ energy drinks.  Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment
was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.4
million lower than contribution margin of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2007.  The decrease in the contribution
margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in
gross margin as a result of increases in the costs of certain raw materials,
particularly apple juice concentrate, as well as a change


from
high fructose corn syrup to higher priced sugar, which additionally increased
in price, for our soda lines.  The
decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was partially
offset by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a
result of the termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of
California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children (“WIC”)
Supplemental Nutrition Branch in

April 2008.  The WIC
program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with our apple, grape, white grape and
pineapple 64-ounce juice products.  Juice
blends are not eligible under the new program.

Operating Income.

Operating income was $163.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately
$67.4 million, or 29.2% lower than operating income of $231.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007. 
Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.8% for the
year ended December 31, 2008 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31,
2007.  The decrease in operating income
and operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an
increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million.  Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition
of deferred revenue of $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to new and/or amended distribution
agreements entered into with certain distributors; (ii) exclusive of
expenditures of $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with
terminating existing distributors; and (iii) exclusive of professional
service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special
investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation
and other related matters, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a percentage of net
sales, was 25.8% and 28.1% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Interest
and Other Income, net

.  Net interest and other income was $9.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $1.1 million
from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  This increase was primarily attributable to
increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term
investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. This
increase was partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses.

Provision for Income Taxes

.  Provision for income taxes for
the year ended December 31, 2008 was $65.4 million, as compared to $90.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The effective combined federal and state tax
rate was 37.7% for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Net Income

.  Net income was $108.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $41.4 million or 27.7% lower than
net income of $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

The decrease in net
income was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses of
$138.2 million due to the items identified above. This was partially offset by
an increase in gross profit of $70.8 million and a decrease in provision for
income taxes of $24.9 million.

Results
of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year
Ended December 31, 2006

Gross Sales.*

Gross sales were $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an
increase of approximately $329.5 million or 47.3% higher than gross sales of
$696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The increase in gross sales was primarily
attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy
drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in April 2002),
lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in August 2003), Monster
Energy® Assault® energy drinks (introduced in September 2004) and Monster
Energy® Khaos

TM

energy
drinks (introduced in August 2005), as well as sales of certain new
products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks (introduced in April 2007), Monster Energy® M-80

TM

energy drinks (introduced in March 2007),
Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and
Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks (introduced in  November 2007).


To
a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased
sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, Unbound Energy

®

energy drinks (introduced in October 2006) and Junior
Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by
decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks (introduced in January 2004),
iced teas, Joker Mad Energy™ drinks (introduced in January 2005) and
Hansen’s® fruit juice smoothies.  Changes
in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales for
the year ended December 31, 2007. 
However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price
increase for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line
of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1,
2008.  We estimate that approximately 7%
to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to
purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional
and other allowances were $121.3 million for 2007, an increase of $30.8 million
or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $90.5 million for
2006. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased
to 11.8% in 2007 from 13.0% in 2006.  As
a result, the percentage increase in gross sales in 2007 was lower than the
percentage increase in net sales.

*Gross
sales — see definition above.

Net
Sales.

Net sales were $904.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2007, an increase of approximately $298.7 million or 49.3% higher than net
sales of $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The increase in net sales was primarily
attributable to

increased sales by volume of our
Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks,
lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy® Assault® energy drinks and
Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new
products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks, Monster Energy® M-80

TM

energy drinks, Monster Energy®
MIXXD

™ energy drinks
and Monster Energy

®

Heavy Metal™ energy drinks

.  To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales
was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends,
aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in net
sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® drinks,
iced teas, Joker Mad Energy™ drinks, smoothies in cans and Hansen’s® energy
drinks. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in
net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007.  However, during the fourth quarter of 2007,
we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and
our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1,
2008.  We estimate that approximately 7%
to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to
purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases.

Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 98.5
million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 25.7
million cases or 35.3% higher than case sales of 72.7 million cases for the
year ended December 31, 2006. The overall average net sales price per case
increased to $9.19 for 2007 or 10.3% higher than the average net sales price
per case of $8.33 for 2006.  The increase
in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the
proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products.

Net sales for the DSD segment were $809.8 million
for year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $295.5
million or 57.5% higher than net sales of $514.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The increase in net sales was
primarily attributable to

increased
sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include
Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Energy®
Assault® energy drinks and Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new
products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks and Monster Energy® M-80

TM

energy
drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by
volume of Lost Energy® drinks and Joker Mad Energy™ drinks.  Changes in pricing within the DSD segment did
not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31,
2007.  However, during the fourth quarter
of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy® brand energy
drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks,
effective January 1, 2008.  We
estimate that approximately 7% to


8%
of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases
made by our customers in advance of such price increases.

Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately
$3.2 million or 3.5% higher than net sales of $91.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to

increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends,
aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The increase in net
sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of iced teas,
smoothies in cans and Hansen’s® energy drinks. 
Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material
impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Gross Profit.**

*
Gross profit was $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an
increase of approximately $151.4 million or 47.8% higher than the gross profit
of $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
51.7% for 2007 as compared to 52.3% for 2006. 
Increases in sales volumes contributed to the increase in gross profit
dollars.  The decrease in gross profit as
a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of
sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit
margins.  To a lesser extent, the
decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to
an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners,
certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates and
increased reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Such decrease in
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased
sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those
in the Warehouse segment, a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a
percentage of gross sales.

***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since
some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in
cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such
costs within another line item such as operating expenses.

Operating Expenses

. Total operating expenses were $237.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2007, an increase of approximately $79.0 million or 50.0% higher than total
operating expenses of $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 26.2% for 2007,
slightly higher than 26.1% for 2006.  The
increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially attributable to
increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $8.7 million primarily due
to increased volume of shipments, increased expenditures of $18.4 million for
sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $10.3 million for
commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $4.9 million for sampling
programs, increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased expenditures
of $8.6 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting
fees, and increased expenditures of $2.5 million relating to the costs
associated with terminating existing distributors. Included in legal and
accounting fees are costs of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance
reimbursements) in connection with our special investigation of stock option
grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters.
Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7
million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated
with terminating existing distributors and exclusive of expenditures of $9.8
million (net of $2.5 million in insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million for
2007 and 2006, respectively in connection with our special investigation of
stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other
related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 23.4% for both 2007 and
2006.

Contribution Margin.

Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $281.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $93.8 million or 49.9%
higher than contribution margin of $187.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The increase in contribution
margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net
sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new
products such as the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated


dairy based coffee drinks and Monster M-80

TM

energy drinks.  Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment
was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of
approximately $2.2 million or 36.3% lower than contribution margin of $6.1
million for year ended December 31, 2006. 
The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was
primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased
costs of raw materials and production.

Operating Income.

Operating income was $231.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately
$72.4 million or 45.7% higher than operating income of $158.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006. 
Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.5% for
2007 from 26.2% for 2006.  The increase
in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $151.4
million.  The decrease in operating
income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. 
Operating income, exclusive of recognition of deferred revenue of $1.9
million and $0.4 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the
AB Distribution agreements entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors,
exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006,
respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing
distributors and exclusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million
insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, in
connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting
practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net
sales, was 28.2% for 2007 as compared to 28.9% for 2006.

Interest
and Other Income, net

.  Net interest and other income was $8.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $5.1 million
from net interest and other income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The increase in net interest and
other income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on
our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased
significantly over the prior year.

Provision for Income Taxes

.  Provision for income taxes for
the year ended December 31, 2007 was $90.3 million, as compared to
provision for income taxes of $64.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The effective combined federal and
state tax rate for 2007 was 37.7%, which was lower than the effective tax rate
of 39.6% for 2006.  The decrease in the
effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned
on securities that is exempt from federal income taxes and a reduction in
federal taxes attributable to the domestic production tax deduction.  This decrease was partially offset by stock-based
compensation relating to incentive stock options that is not deducted for
federal or state income tax purposes.

Net Income

.  Net income was $149.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $51.5 million or 52.5% higher than
net income of $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The increase in net
income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $151.4
million and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net interest and other income
of approximately $5.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in
operating expenses of $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income
taxes of $26.1 million.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Cash flows provided by operating
activities —

Net cash provided by
operating activities was $199.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2008, as compared to $135.5 million in the comparable period in 2007.  For the year ended December 31, 2008,
cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income
earned of $108.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses
consisting of $13.9 million of stock-based compensation and $3.4 million of
depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
cash provided by operations also increased due to a $98.6 million increase in
deferred revenue, a $98.1 million increase in accrued distributor terminations,
a $30.6 million decrease in trade accounts receivable, a $7.5 million increase
in accounts


payable, a $3.3 million increase in accrued
liabilities and a $1.0 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year
ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was reduced
due to an $85.3 million increase in distributor receivables, a $19.7 million increase
in inventories, a $4.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current
assets and a $4.3 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock
options. The increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increased
inventory levels.

Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities

—

Net cash
provided by investing activities was $144.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2008, as compared to $194.7 million used in investing activities in the
comparable period in 2007.  For the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, cash used in investing
activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and long-term
investments, particularly available-for-sale investments.  Cash provided by investing activities was
primarily attributable to sales and maturities of available-for-sale
investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the
acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and
other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production
equipment, computer and office furniture and equipment used for sales and
administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements.  Management expects that the Company will
continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for
operations, for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other
corporate purposes. From time to time, management considers the acquisition of
capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to
produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans, trucks and promotional
vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction
of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of our brands.

At December 31, 2008, we had $256.8 million in
cash and cash equivalents and $118.7 million in short- and long-term
investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury
bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction
reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market
funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to
general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be
exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various
sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These
market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative
adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition. (See Part I, Item IA – “Risk Factors – Our investments in
marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect
the liquidity of these investments”).

Certain of our short-term
investments and all of our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate
securities. The majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better
credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or
monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at
pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days.  Liquidity for these auction rate securities
was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell
their notes at periodic auctions.  During
the year ended December 31, 2008, a large portion of the auctions for
these auction rate securities failed and there is no assurance that auctions on
the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed.
The auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers
and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and
sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing
the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default
rate that may be above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for
which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their
predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until
their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature
or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our
ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate
securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, certain of these
securities have been classified as long-term investments in our consolidated
financial statements.  We anticipate that
due to the default interest rates now payable on certain of these securities
and for other reasons, certain issuers are likely to take steps to refinance
their


notes to enable them to call and repay the
securities and therefore avoid the default interest rates now payable on such
securities.

At December 31, 2008, we held auction rate
securities with a face value of $112.5 million. 
Subsequent to December 31, 2008, $8.1 million of our auction rate
securities were redeemed at par, which are included in short-term investments
in our consolidated financial statements. A Level 3 valuation was performed on
the remaining $104.5 million of our auction rate securities as of December 31,
2008, which indicated an impairment of $14.9 million, resulting in a fair value
of $89.6 million which is included in long-term investments in our consolidated
financial statements. This valuation utilized a mark to model approach which
included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit
and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods for the auction rate
securities.  These assumptions are
typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and
market conditions evolve.

In addition to our Level 3 valuation performed as of
December 31, 2008, we also reviewed various factors in determining whether
to record a temporary or other than temporary impairment charge related to the
decline in fair value on our available-for sale securities, including length of
time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than the
cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and
any guarantors if applicable, any specific events which may influence the
operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment
for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair
value.  Based on this analysis, we
determined that of the $14.9 million impairment on our auction rate securities,
$14.4 million was deemed temporary. This amount has been recorded, net of a tax
benefit of $5.7 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss
for the year ended December 31, 2008. 
In addition, we determined that $0.5 million of impairment was
other-than-temporary and recorded a charge to interest and other income, net,
in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2008.

Based on our ability to access cash and other
short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do
not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will
have a material effect on our liquidity or working capital.  If uncertainties in the credit and capital
markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities
held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these
investments.

Cash
flows (used in) provided by financing activities —

Net cash used in financing activities was
$98.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to net
cash provided by financing activities of $36.6 million for the comparable
period in 2007.  For the year ended December 31,
2008 cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the purchase by us
of $103.5 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31,
2008, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a
$4.3 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock
options and proceeds of $2.3 million received from the issuance of common stock
in connection with the exercise of certain stock options.

Purchases
of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition
of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts
payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to
remain our principal recurring use of cash.

On April 25, 2008, our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock. The Board
of Directors also terminated the common stock repurchase program authorized in November 2005,
under which we had purchased $27.7 million of common stock.  During the year ended December 31, 2008,
we purchased 3.9 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of
$26.77 per share, which we hold in treasury.


Debt and other obligations

—

We entered into a credit facility with
Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of credit, which was
amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the
credit facility, we increased our available borrowings under the revolving line
of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt.  The revolving line of credit is effective
through June 1, 2010.  Interest on
borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus
up to 1.5%, or varying London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) up to 180 days,
plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial
ratios maintained by us. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of
credit at December 31, 2008. Letters of credit issued on our behalf
totaling $0.3 million under this credit facility were outstanding as of December 31,
2008.

The terms of our line of
credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios,
with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2008.

If any event of default shall occur for any reason,
whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion
outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights
and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings.

We believe that cash available from operations,
including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient
for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials
and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities,
expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as
well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next
twelve months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that
capital expenditures are likely to be less than $20.0 million through December 2009.  However, future business opportunities may
cause a change in this estimate.

The
following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and
related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2008:

Noncancelable
contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and
other commitments.  (See “Part II,
Item 8 — Note 11— Commitments & Contingencies”).

Purchase
commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various
suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our
products.  These obligations vary in
terms.

In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a
can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”),
dated as of January 1, 2006, we have undertaken to purchase a minimum
volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period
commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009.  Should we fail to purchase the minimum
volume, we will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital
reimbursements on a pro-


rated basis.  Our maximum
liability under this agreement as of December 31, 2008 is $4.0 million,
subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this
agreement.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we finalized
licensing agreements with SAP America, Inc. for our global enterprise
resource planning (“ERP”) software initiative which will replace existing
legacy software.  Our decision to replace our legacy software solutions
and move to SAP technologies was based upon our current domestic needs, global
expansion, systems scalability, improved integration with trading partners and
customers, improved reporting, and business process efficiency and
productivity.  We estimate the cost for both licensing and implementation
of the initiative to be approximately $5.5 million.  The project is
scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2009 with a targeted production
live date in the first quarter of 2010.

In September 2007, we
relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California.
In October 2006, we also entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which
we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in
Corona, California.  This lease
commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007,
excluding renewal options.  The monthly
rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over
the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse
and distribution space replaced our previous warehouse

and distribution space also located in
Corona, California.

In October 2006, we
entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase
price of $1.4 million, which is currently in escrow.  In August 2008, we completed the
purchase of an additional 1.09 acres of adjacent land for a purchase price of
$1.4 million.  The properties are located
adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution space.  We are reviewing the feasibility of
constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of
land to replace our existing office space.

We have sublet a small portion of our previous office,
warehouse and distribution space on a month to month basis.  In addition, we continue to utilize the
remaining portion of this space as overflow for our main warehouse.  This lease expires in October 2010.

Accounting
Policies and Pronouncements

Critical Accounting Policies

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.  GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial
statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable
and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as
well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other
transactions that occur in the normal course of business.  The following summarizes our most significant
accounting and reporting policies and practices:

Investments

–
Our investments in debt securities are classified in one of two categories,
held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”).
Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold until maturity.  All other securities not included in the
held-to-maturity category are classified as available-for-sale.  No securities are held for speculative or
trading purposes.  Held-to-maturity securities
are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. A decline in the market value of
any investment security below cost that is deemed other-than-temporary, results
in a reduction in its carrying amount to fair value.  The


impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost
basis for the security is established. 
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the
related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the
effective-interest method.  We evaluate
whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than temporary at
each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and
includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held,
market and economic trends in the industry and information on the investee
company’s financial condition and information on the guarantors’ financial
condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary
include length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been
less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of
the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence
the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment
for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery of fair value.

Accounts
Receivable

– We evaluate the collectability of our trade
accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we
become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded,
which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will
ultimately be collected.  In addition to
specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are
recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due
trade accounts receivable outstanding.

Inventories

– Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture
the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We
regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for
excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of
product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned.  Demand for our products can fluctuate
significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include
unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic
conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders
or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued
weakening of economic conditions. 
Additionally, management’s estimates of future product demand may be
inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision
required for excess and obsolete inventory.

Long-Lived
Assets –

Management regularly reviews property and equipment
and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for
possible impairment.  This review occurs
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  If there is indication of impairment of property
and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an
estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges)
expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If these cash flows are less than the
carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down
the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the
present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
management’s estimates of the business risks. 
No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2008.

Management
believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived
assets, including its trademarks, is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) the
estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it
requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount
rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the
assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could
be material.  Management’s assumptions
about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual
revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue
to do so.


Intangibles

– Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our
exclusive ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the
manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products
and the Monster Energy® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and
distribution of supplements and beverages. 
We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United
States, as well as in a number of countries around the world.  We also own the Blue Sky® trademark, which
was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice® trademark, which was
acquired in May 2001. During 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”. Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, we discontinued
amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize
remaining trademarks over one to 25 years.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an
indication of impairment.  If there is an
indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to
amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying
amount of the asset.  An impairment loss
is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is
less than the carrying amount.  The fair
value is calculated using the income approach. 
However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is
inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions
concerning expected future conditions. 
Based on management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31,
2008, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value.

In estimating future
revenues, we use internal budgets. 
Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future
marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions
of new products and their impact on our future cash flows.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

– The accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are
translated in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses
are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they occur. Net
foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange
gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a
long-term-investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in
the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Revenue Recognition

– We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability is reasonably assured.

Generally, ownership of and title
to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to
customers.  Certain of our distributors
may also perform a separate function as a copacker on our behalf. In such
cases, ownership of and title to our products that are copacked on our behalf
by those copackers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when
we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the
relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined
after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-09, “Accounting for Consideration
Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)”.

Management believes that adequate provision has been
made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical
experience.


Cost of Sales

– Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the
manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight
charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses
incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality
control costs.  Raw materials account for
the largest portion of the cost of sales. 
Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and
packaging materials.

Operating Expenses

– Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution
expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after
manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and
in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale
materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and
design expenses.  Operating expenses also
include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal
fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors,
entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and
administrative costs.

Stock-Based Compensation

– We
account for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment
awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of our
stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our employee
stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options. For example, employee stock options are generally subject to
vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the
number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the
estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that
will ultimately be realized by an employee. We use historical data to estimate
the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected
forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve
in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual
results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in
estimating the key assumptions, we may be required to increase or decrease
compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to our
results of operations.

Income Taxes

– Current income tax
expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current
year.  A deferred income tax asset or
liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary
differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
We consider future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets.  If we determine that it is more likely than
not that these assets will not be realized, we will reduce the value of these
assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income.  Evaluating the value of these assets is
necessarily based on our judgment.  If we
subsequently determine that the deferred tax assets, which had been written
down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets
would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that
determination was made.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157
for our financial assets and liabilities. Our adoption of SFAS No. 157 did
not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.  In accordance with FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB


Statement No. 157” (“FSP 157-2”), we elected to
defer until January 1, 2009 the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for all
nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of
SFAS No. 157 for those assets and liabilities within the scope of FSP
157-2 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS
No. 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
Market for that Asset is Not Active” (“FSP 157-3”), that clarifies the
application of SFAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and provides an
example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a
financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP
157-3 is effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which the
financial statements have not been issued. 
The adoption of FSP 157-3 did not have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

SFAS No. 157 provides a framework for
measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value
measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be
received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a
liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. SFAS No. 157
also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the
three levels of inputs required by the standard that we use to measure fair
value.

·

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

·

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.

·

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity
and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

SFAS
No. 157 requires the use of observable market inputs (quoted market
prices) when measuring fair value and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be
used to measure fair value whenever possible.

On
January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”), which permits entities to choose
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We
already record marketable securities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” The
adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have an impact on our consolidated
financial statements as management did not elect the fair value option for any
other financial instruments.

In
May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SFAS No. 162”). This standard is
intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework,
or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing
financial statements that are presented in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for
non-governmental entities. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the
SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (“PCAOB”)
amendments to Interim Auditing Standards Section 411, “The Meaning of
Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” We
do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on of
our consolidated financial statements.


In April 2008, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of Useful
Life of Intangible Assets” (“FSP 142-3”). FSP 142-3 amends the factors that
should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to
determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
SFAS No.142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” FSP 142-3 also
requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset
useful lives. FSP 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of
FSP 142-3 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Sales

The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly
data regarding sales for the past five years. 
Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of
annual results or continuing trends.

Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case
volume.  A “unit case” means a unit of
measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce
servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished
beverage.  The Company defines unit case
volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages
directly or indirectly sold by us.  Sales
of food bars, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed
in actual cases.

Our
quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the
result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year.  It has been our experience that beverage
sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal
year.  Because the primary historical
market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate,
the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated;
however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of our
products expands outside of California. Our experience with our energy drink
products suggests they are less seasonal than traditional beverages.  As the percentage of our sales that are
represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will
be further mitigated.  Quarterly
fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction
of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are
more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the
mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased
advertising and promotional expenses. 
(See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Seasonality”).


¹

Net revenues
for the fourth quarter of 2008 included the recognition of $11.6 million of
revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated
with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of
2008.  Average price per case exclusive
of this recognition was $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31,
2008.

Inflation

We do
not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of
operations for the periods presented.

Forward-Looking
Statements

The
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe
harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.  Certain statements made in this report may
constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A
of the Securities Act 1933, as amended, and Section 21.E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with
respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our
existing credit facility, among other things. 
All statements containing a projection of revenues, income (loss),
earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure
or other financial items, a statement of management’s plans and objectives for
future operations, or a statement of future economic performance contained in
management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations, including statements related to new products, volume growth and
statements encompassing general optimism about future operating results and
non-historical information, are forward looking statements within the meaning
of the Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “thinks,” “anticipates,”
“plans,” “expects,” and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements.

The foregoing list of important factors and other
risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. 
See “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors,” for a more complete
discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and
uncertainties.  Those factors and the
other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important
factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially
from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.  Other unknown or unpredictable factors also
could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially
different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking
statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and
projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these
uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of
the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates
to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated
with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in
circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except
to the extent required by applicable securities laws.

ITEM 7A.               QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

In the
normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a
variety of risks.  The principal market
risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and
prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices,
commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other  raw materials (including, but not limited to,
increases in the price of aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as
well as cane sugar, glucose, sucrose and milk and cream, which are used in many
of our products) and limited availability of certain raw materials.  We are also subject to market risks with
respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased
costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which
we operate.  In addition, we are subject
to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate,
including the collectability of accounts receivable.

We do not use derivative financial instruments to
protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and do not hedge against
fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use hedging agreements or
alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient
ingredients or raw materials, including, but not limited to, cans, PET plastic
bottles, glass, labels, sucrose, glucose, sucralose, flavors, supplements,
certain sweeteners or packaging arrangements, or protecting against shortages
of such ingredients or raw materials.


Our gross sales to
customers outside of the United States were approximately 8.2% of consolidated
gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Our growth strategy includes expanding our international
business. As a result, we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange
rates. These changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We do not consider
the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted
foreign currency exchange rates, as of December 31, 2008, to be
significant.  For the year ended December 31, 2008 we did not use
derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency
fluctuations.

We are primarily exposed to market risks from
fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the
market values of our short term investments. 
Certain of our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk
because these investments generally include a fixed interest rate.  As a result, the market values of these
investments are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates.

At December 31, 2008, we had $256.8 million in
cash and cash equivalents and $118.7 million in short- and long-term
investments.  We have historically invested these amounts in U.S.
government agencies, municipal securities or notes (which may have an auction
reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market
funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to
general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be
exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various
sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues.

The applicable interest rate on auction rate
securities is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to
35 days.  Liquidity for auction rate
securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders
to sell their notes.  During the year
ended December 31, 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction
rate securities failed. Based on an assessment of fair value as of December 31,
2008, we determined that there was a decline in fair value of our auction rate
securities of $14.9 million.  We
determined that of the $14.9 million decline in fair value of our auction rate
securities, $14.4 million was deemed temporary. 
This amount has been recorded, net of a tax benefit of $5.7 million, as
a component of other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31,
2008. In addition, we determined that the remaining $0.5 million was other than
temporary and recorded a charge in other income and expense, net, for the year
ended December 31, 2008.   There is no assurance that auctions on the
remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will
succeed.  These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may
have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity
and financial condition.  (See “Part I,
Item 1A Risk Factors —

Our investments in
marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and
affect the liquidity of these investments”

and “Part I, Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

—

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and
15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are adequate and effective to ensure that information we are required to
disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
its


principal
executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— There were
no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the fiscal period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

— Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on the framework in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our management’s evaluation
under the framework in

Internal Control -
Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has
been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hansen Natural Corporation

Corona, California

We have audited the internal control over financial
reporting of Hansen Natural Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

December 31, 2008, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.  The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management,
and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31,
2008 of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
schedule.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hansen Natural Corporation

Corona, California

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hansen Natural Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008.  Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). 
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the

Company as of December 31, 2008
and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27,
2009, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization

describe the operating business of the Company are references to the business
of HBC unless otherwise indicated.

In addition, HBC,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co. (“Blue Sky”)

beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks
and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and “functional” drinks,
non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks,

Basis of Presentation

–

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

Reclassifications

– The Company has reclassified $0.1 million of
customer deposit liabilities to accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2007 in order to conform to the current year
presentation.  The Company also
reclassified $5.4 million of trade accounts receivable, net to distributor
receivables on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 in
order to conform to the current year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

– The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries since their respective dates of
incorporation.  All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

–

The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the
year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that
exceed the federally insured


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

(Tabular
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

limits.  The Company has not experienced any loss as a
result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future.

Investments

–
The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified in one of two
categories, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”).
Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold until maturity.  All other securities not included in the
held-to-maturity category are classified as available-for-sale.  No securities are held for speculative or
trading purposes.  Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. A decline in the market value of any
investment security below cost that is deemed other-than-temporary, results in
a reduction in its carrying amount to fair value.  The impairment is charged to earnings and a
new cost basis for the security is established. 
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the
related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the
effective-interest method.  The Company
evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than
temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by
management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the
securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on
the investee company’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on
the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether
a loss is temporary include length of time and extent to which the investments
fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events
which may influence the operations of the issuer and the Company’s intent and
ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to
allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.

Accounts
Receivable –

The Company evaluates the collectability of its
trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where
the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its
financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is
estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the
estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected.  In addition to specific customer
identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on
the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade
accounts receivable outstanding.

Inventories

– Inventories are
valued at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market value (net
realizable value).

Property and Equipment

– Property
and equipment are stated at cost. 
Depreciation of furniture, office equipment, equipment and vehicles is
based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated
using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based
on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related
leases and is calculated using the straight-line method.

Intangibles

– Intangibles are comprised of trademarks representing the Company’s exclusive
ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale
and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster
Energy® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of
supplements and beverages.  The Company
also owns a number of other trademarks in the United States as well as in a
number of countries around the world.  In
addition, the Company owns the Blue Sky® trademark, which was acquired in September 2000,
and the Junior Juice® trademark, which was acquired in May 2001.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill
and


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

(Tabular
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

Other Intangible Assets,”
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are
measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an
impairment exits. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the
carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value.
If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is
recorded. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over
their respective useful lives which range from 1 to 25 years.

Long-Lived Assets

– Management
regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including
certain intangibles, for possible impairment. 
This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  If there is indication of impairment,
management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition.  If these cash
flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized
to write down the asset to its estimated fair value.  The fair value is estimated using the present
value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected
future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best
estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions.  For the fiscal years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, there were no impairment losses recorded.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

– The accounts of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries are translated in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign
Currency Translation”.  Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net,
at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting
from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.
Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany
transactions that are of a long-term-investment nature (i.e., settlement is not
planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.

Revenue Recognition

– The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

Generally, ownership of and title
to the Company’s products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to
customers.  Certain of the Company’s
distributors may also perform a separate function as a copacker on the Company’s
behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company’s products that
are copacked on the Company’s behalf by those copackers who are also
distributors, passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them
that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the
Company’s finished goods.  Net sales have
been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products)”

.

Management believes that adequate provision has been
made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical
experience.

Cost of Sales

– Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the
manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight
charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses
incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and
certain quality control costs.  Raw
materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales.  Raw materials include cans, bottles, other
containers, ingredients and packaging materials.


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

(Tabular
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

Operating Expenses

– Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution
expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after
manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store
demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials
and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design
expenses.  Operating expenses also
include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees
including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s
prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs.

Freight Costs

– For the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, freight-out costs amounted to
$45.1 million, $40.8 million and $36.2 million, respectively, and have been
recorded in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income.

Advertising
Expenses

– The Company accounts for advertising production
costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising
takes place. Advertising expenses, including but not limited to production
costs, amounted to $84.6 million, $66.6 million and $35.7 million for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Advertising expenses are included in
operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Income Taxes

– The Company
accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes”. This statement requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been
recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of
the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws.  In the event the future consequences of
differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the Company’s
assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset, SFAS No. 109
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future
benefits indicated by such asset.  A
valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.

Stock-Based Compensation

– The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”).  SFAS No. 123R requires the fair value of
all stock option awards issued to employees to be recorded as an expense over
the related vesting period.  Generally,
the Company recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture
rate on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the reward,
which is typically the vesting term of five years.  The Company estimated the forfeiture rate for
fiscal 2008 based on historical experience with actual forfeitures during the
preceding five fiscal years.

Net Income Per Common Share

– In
accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share”, net income per common
share, on a basic and diluted basis, is presented for all periods.  Basic net income per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during each period.  Diluted net income
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of
common equivalent shares assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of
assumed treasury share repurchases at average market prices, as applicable.

Concentration of Risk –

Certain
of the Company’s products utilize components (raw materials and/or co-packing
services) from a limited number of sources. 
A disruption in the supply of such components could significantly affect
the Company’s revenues from those products, as alternative sources of such
components may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or within a
reasonably short time period.  The
Company continues to take steps on an ongoing basis to secure the availability
of alternative sources for such components and minimize the risk of any
disruption in production.

The Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., a former
customer of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 13%, 16% and 19% of
our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of both
the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 12%
of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Our distribution agreement with the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
was terminated by us effective November 9, 2008.  The related terminated distributor
territories are now serviced by a combination of

Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (“CCE”),
Coca-Cola Bottling Company (“CCBC”), CCBCC Operations, LLC (“Consolidated”),
United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC (“United”), and other Coca-Cola Company
(“TCCC”) independent bottlers (collectively, the “TCCC North American Bottlers”)
and Anheuser-Busch Distributors (the “AB Distributors”) (See Note
17).  If the TCCC North American Bottlers
and/or AB Distributors are generally not as successful in selling our products
as the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. was, this could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and consolidated results of operations.

Credit Risk

– The Company sells
its products nationally and internationally, primarily to retailers and
beverage distributors.  The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not
require collateral.  The Company
maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, and historically, such losses
have been within management’s expectations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

– The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturity of the
respective instruments.

Use of Estimates

– The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

–
On January 1, 2008, the Company
adopted SFAS” No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” for its financial assets
and liabilities. The Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a
material impact on its financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.  In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 157-2, “Effective
Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP 157-2”), the Company elected to
defer until January 1, 2009 the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for all
nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of
SFAS No. 157 for those assets and liabilities within the scope of FSP
157-2 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In October 2008, the
FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial
Asset When the Market for that Asset is Not Active” (“FSP 157-3”), that clarifies
the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and
provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair
value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not
active. FSP 157-3 is effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which
the financial statements have not been issued. 
The adoption of FSP 157-3 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

SFAS No. 157 provides a
framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding
fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that
would be received


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

(Tabular
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to
transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. SFAS No. 157
also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the
three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to
measure fair value.

·

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

·

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.

·

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity
and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

SFAS No. 157 requires the use of observable
market inputs (quoted market prices) when measuring fair value and requires a
Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever possible.

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 159,
“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including
an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”), which
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have an impact
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as management did not elect
the fair value option for any other financial instruments.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,
“The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (“SFAS No. 162”).
This standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a
consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be
used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with
GAAP for non-governmental entities. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days
following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s
amendments to Interim Auditing Standards Section 411, “The Meaning of
Present Fairly in Conformity with GAAP.” 
The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB
issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of Useful Life of Intangible
Assets” (“FSP 142-3”). FSP 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered
in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No.142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” FSP 142-3 also requires expanded disclosure related to
the determination of intangible asset useful lives. FSP 142-3 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not
permitted.  The Company does not expect
the adoption of FSP 142-3 to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.

2.

FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES

In accordance with SFAS No. 157, the following
represents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets (cash
equivalents and investments) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31,
2008:

The Company’s Level 3 assets
are comprised of municipal or educational related or other public body notes
with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”). The majority of
these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are
additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance
companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals,
usually every 7 to 35 days. 
Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an
auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic
auctions.  During the year ended December 31,
2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed
and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate
securities in the Company’s investment portfolio will succeed. The auction
failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying
demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors.  In the event that there is a failed auction,
the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay
interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar
instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to
accrue and/or pay interest at their predetermined rates and be auctioned every
7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the
securities, they mature or the Company is able to sell the securities to third
parties. As a result, the Company’s ability to liquidate and fully recover the
carrying value of its auction rate securities in the near term may be limited.
Consequently, certain of these securities are classified as long-term
investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At December 31, 2008, the Company held auction
rate securities with a face value of $112.5 million.  Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the
Company redeemed $8.1 million of auction rate securities at par, which are
included in short-term investments. A Level 3 valuation was performed on the
remaining $104.5 million of the Company’s auction rate securities as of December 31,
2008, which indicated an impairment of $14.9 million, resulting in a fair value
of

$89.6
million which is included in long-term investments. This valuation utilized a
mark to model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and
amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding
periods for the auction rate securities. 
These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the
underlying data sources and market conditions evolve.

In addition to the Company’s Level 3 valuation
performed as of December 31, 2008, the Company also reviewed various
factors in determining whether to record a temporary or other than temporary
impairment charge related to the decline in fair value on our available-for
sale securities, including length of time and extent to which the investments
fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the issuer and any guarantors if applicable, any
specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer, and our
intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to
allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.  Based on this analysis, the Company
determined that of the $14.9 million impairment of its auction rate securities,
$14.4 million was deemed temporary. This amount has been recorded, net of a tax
benefit of $5.7 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss
for the year ended December 31, 2008. 
In addition, the Company determined that $0.5 million of impairment was
other than temporary and recorded a charge to interest and other income, net,
for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Based on the Company’s ability to access cash and
other short-term investments and based on the Company’s expected operating cash
flows, the Company does not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of
these investments will have a material effect on its liquidity or working
capital.  If uncertainties in the credit
and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction
rate securities held by the Company, the Company may be required to recognize
additional impairments on these investments.

The following table provides a summary of changes in
fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial assets as of December 31,
2008:

The Company’s short-term investments
as of December 31, 2007 included variable rate demand notes of $60.6
million.  Although the underlying
maturities of these securities are long-term in nature, the investments are
classified as short-term because they contain a ‘put’ feature which allows the
holder to tender the securities at par value on seven days notice.  The ‘put’ feature is supported by a letter of
credit or standby purchase agreement provided by a highly-rated commercial
bank. The notes are issued by municipalities and other tax-exempt entities and
the interest rate payable on these investments resets on a weekly basis.  Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the
Company redeemed all its holdings of variable rate demand notes at par value.
Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company redeemed $8.1 million of
auction rate securities at par.

LONG-TERM DEBT

HBC has a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”)
consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in May 2007. In
accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, HBC increased

credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying
London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) up to 180 days, plus an additional
percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained
by HBC. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31,
2008 and 2007. Letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company totaling $0.3
million under this credit facility were outstanding as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

The terms of the Company’s line of credit contain
certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios.  The Company was in compliance with these
covenants at December 31, 2008.

If any
event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary,
Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit
immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them,
including instituting legal proceedings.

Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31:

At December 31, 2008

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating Leases

– In October 2006, we also entered
into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of
warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California.  This lease commitment provides for minimum
rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal
options.  The monthly rental payments are
$167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by
7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution
space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in
Corona, California.

In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to
acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, which is
currently in escrow.  In August 2008,
we completed the purchase of an additional 1.09 acres of adjacent land for a
purchase price of $1.4 million.  The
properties are located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution
space.  We are reviewing the feasibility
of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels
of land to replace our existing office space.

In September 2007, we relocated our corporate
offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California. The Company has sublet a
small portion of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space on a
month to month basis.  In addition, we
continue to utilize the remaining portion of this space as overflow for our
main warehouse.  This lease expires in October 2010.

The Company also rents
additional warehouse space on a short-tem basis from time to time in public
warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada.

Rent expense was $3.5
million, $3.3 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments at December 31, 2008 under the
operating leases referred to above are as follows:

Purchase Commitments

– The Company has purchase commitments aggregating
approximately $44.6 million, which represent commitments made by the Company
and its subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the manufacturing
and packaging of its products.  These
obligations vary in terms.

In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a
can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”),
dated as of January 1, 2006, we have undertaken to purchase a minimum
volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period
commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009.  Should we fail to purchase the

NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands,
  Except Per Share Amounts)

minimum
volume, we will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital
reimbursements on a pro-rated basis.  Our
maximum liability under this agreement as of December 31, 2008 is $4.0
million, subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this
agreement.

The Company
purchases various raw material items, including, but not limited to, flavors,
ingredients, containers, milk and cream from a limited number of
resources.  An interruption in supply
from any of such resources could result in the Company’s inability to produce
certain products for limited or possibly extended periods of time.  The aggregate value of purchases from
suppliers of such limited resources described above for the year ended December 31,
2008 was $116.2 million.

Noncancelable
contractual obligations

– The Company has noncancelable contractual obligations aggregating
approximately $53.0 million related primarily to sponsorships and other
commitments, payable over four years.

Licensing
Agreements

– The
Company produces, sells and distributes Lost® Energy™ drinks under an exclusive
license with Lost International LLC.  The
license agreement requires certain royalty payments to be made related to the
sale of Lost® brand products.  Royalty
expense under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006 was $0.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.7 million, respectively.

Litigation

– In August 2006, HBC filed a lawsuit against
National Beverage Company, Shasta Beverages, Inc., Newbevco Inc. and Freek’N
Beverage Corp. (collectively “National”) seeking an injunction and damages for
trademark infringement, trademark dilution, unfair competition and deceptive
trade practices based on National’s unauthorized use of HBC’s valuable and
distinctive Monster Energy® trade dress in connection with a line of energy
drinks it launched under the “Freek” brand name.  In June 2007, the parties entered into a
confidential settlement agreement resolving the parties’ disputes in the
litigation.  National subsequently
repudiated the settlement agreement and HBC responded by filing a motion in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California to enforce
the terms of the confidential settlement agreement.  On August 14, 2007, the United States
District Court entered an Order enforcing the settlement agreement and
permanently enjoining National from manufacturing, distributing, shipping,
marketing, selling and offering to sell “Freek” energy drinks in containers
using the original “Freek” trade dress that was subject to the District Court’s
preliminary injunction.  National
appealed the District Court’s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
which heard oral arguments on December 11, 2008.  No decision has been issued on the appeal.

In August 2006, HBC filed a civil action in the
Federal Court of Australia, Victoria District Registry, against Bickford’s
Australia (Pty) Limited and Meak (Pty) Ltd. (collectively “Bickfords”), in
which HBC sought an injunction restraining Bickfords from selling or offering
for sale or promoting in Australia any energy drink or beverage under the MONSTER
ENERGY™ or MONSTER™ marks or any similar marks, and further sought damages and
costs.  Bickfords cross-claimed seeking
an order to restrain HBC from selling, offering for sale or promoting in
Australia any drink product under the Monster Energy or Monster trademarks or
any similar trademarks, and for costs. 
In December 2008, the parties entered into a confidential
settlement agreement resolving the parties’ disputes in the litigation.  Pursuant to the terms of the settlement
agreement, Bickfords will cease all use of the Monster and Monster Energy marks
in Australia (after depletion of its existing inventory) and will assign to HBC
all trademark applications and registrations which consist of or include the MONSTER
ENERGY™ and MONSTER™ marks it has lodged throughout the world, including those
lodged in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia.

In
September 2006, Christopher Chavez purporting to act on behalf of himself
and a class of consumers yet to be defined filed an action in the Superior
Court, of the State of California, City and County of San Francisco, against
the Company and its subsidiaries for unfair business practices, false
advertising, violation of California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, fraud,
deceit and/or misrepresentation alleging that the Company misleadingly labels
its Blue Sky beverages as originating in and/or being canned under the
authority of a company located in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Defendants removed this Superior Court action
to the United States Court for the Northern District of California under the Class Action
Fairness Act, and filed motions for dismissal or transfer.  On June 11, 2007, the United States
District Court, Northern District of California granted the Company’s motion to
dismiss Chavez’s complaint with prejudice.

On June 21, 2007, Chavez filed an appeal with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the Court heard oral arguments
on January 14, 2009.  No decision
has been issued on the appeal.

In January 2007, the Company’s distributor for
the Riverside County and San Bernardino County, California territories, Gate
City Beverage Company (“Gate City”), notified the Company of its intention to
sell its business and requested the Company consent to the assignment of the
distribution agreement with the Company.  The Company declined its consent
and exercised its contractual right to terminate the Gate City distribution
agreement upon thirty days prior written notice.  Gate City threatened to take “appropriate
action” against the Company and third parties for what it contended was an
improper termination of the distribution agreement.  The Company denied Gate City’s assertion
regarding improper termination of the applicable distribution agreement.  On February 6, 2008, Gate City filed a
demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association to be held in
Orange County, California, claiming damages in an amount exceeding $5.0
million, plus attorneys’ fees and costs. 
The Company disputes liability and is defending the claim. The
arbitration hearing has been set for May 2009.

On July 3, 2008, the Company filed a lawsuit in
the Superior Court for the State of California for Los Angeles County against
St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company (“St. Paul”) due to St. Paul’s failure to
reimburse the Company for certain costs and expenses incurred and paid by the
Company for and in connection with the investigation and defense of various
proceedings relating to certain stock option grants made by the Company, including
Special Committee (see “Other Matters” within this Note 11) investigation costs
(the “St. Paul Complaint”).   The Company
purchased from St. Paul a directors and officers insurance policy that the
Company contends covered such expenses during the pertinent time period.   St. Paul has reimbursed the Company for
certain of the costs and expenses associated with the Company’s successful
defense against the subject proceedings, but has refused to pay the remainder
of the limits of its policy.  The St. Paul
Complaint alleges that St. Paul is liable to the Company for the
difference.  The Company seeks damages
arising from St. Paul’s breach of the policy, punitive damages, and
reimbursement of the attorneys’ fees expended in the investigation and
litigation.  On August 1, 2008, St.
Paul removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Central
District of California.  On August 8,
2008, St. Paul answered the St. Paul Complaint and denied that it has any
further responsibility to the Company beyond the amount for which it had
previously reimbursed the Company. 
Motions for summary judgment on certain major issues in the litigation
have been filed by the parties.  The Court
has scheduled a hearing on those motions for March 2009.  A trial has been preliminarily scheduled in
this litigation for November 2009.

On July 11, 2008, the Company initiated an
action against Citigroup Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Citi
Smith Barney, in the United States District Court, Central District of California,
for violations of federal securities laws and the Investment Advisors Act,
arising out of the Company’s purchase of auction rate securities.  The Court granted defendants’ motion to
compel arbitration before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).  The matter is now proceeding before FINRA.

On August 28,
2008, the Company initiated an action against Oppenheimer Holdings Inc.,
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., and Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc., in the
United States District Court, Central District of California, for violations of
federal securities laws and the Investment Advisors Act, arising out of the
Company’s purchase of auction rate securities. 
The defendants answered the complaint on October 14, 2008 denying
the allegations set forth therein.  The
Oppenheimer action was deemed a related case to the Company’s action against
Citigroup Inc. (described above).  After
the Court granted defendants’ motion to compel arbitration in the Citigroup
Inc. case, the Company stipulated to arbitration before FINRA and the matter is
now proceeding before FINRA.

Securities Litigation

- On September 11, 2008, a federal
securities class action complaint styled

Cunha v. Hansen Natural
Corp., et al.

was filed in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California (the “District Court”). On September 17,
2008, a second federal securities class action complaint styled

Brown v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al .

was also filed in the
District Court.

Both actions, filed by single individual
shareholders purportedly on behalf of a class of purchasers of the Company’s
stock during the period May 23, 2007 through November 8, 2007 (the “Class Period”),
name as defendants the Company, Rodney C. Sacks, and Hilton H. Schlosberg. The
allegations of both complaints are substantially similar. Plaintiffs allege violations
of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs allege, among other
things, that during the Class Period, the defendants issued materially
false and misleading statements that failed to disclose that: (i) the
Company’s second quarter sales results were “materially impacted by inventory
loading as customers were induced to purchase more product before the Company
raised its prices in its Monster Energy drink line and its Java Monster drink
line”; (ii) the Company was “experiencing declining sales in its non-core
drink lines”; (iii) the Company was “experiencing production shortfalls
with its Java Monster drink line”; and (iv) as a result of the foregoing,
defendants “lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the
Company and its prospects.” The complaints seek an unspecified amount of
damages.

The New Jersey Carpenters Pension Fund and the
Structural Ironworkers Local Union #1 Pension Fund filed motions on November 10,
2008 for consolidation of the actions and for appointment of Lead Plaintiff and
Lead Counsel.  A hearing on the motions
is expected in March 2009.  If a motion for consolidation is granted,
defendants must respond within forty-five days from the date of service of any
consolidated complaint or the designation of one complaint as the operative
complaint in the consolidated class actions.  If a motion for
consolidation is denied, then defendants must respond to the complaints within
forty-five days from the date on which the denial of such motion is entered on
the Court’s docket.

Derivative Litigation

- On September 15, 2008, a derivative
complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
Riverside, styled

Stueve v. Sacks, et al.

On October 15,
2008, a second derivative complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, styled

Merckel v.
Sacks, et al.

The derivative suits were each brought, purportedly on
behalf of the Company, by a shareholder of the Company who made no prior demand
on the Company’s Board of Directors.

Pursuant to a stipulation among the parties that was
so ordered by the Court on November 2, 2008, the

Stueve

action was voluntarily dismissed in its entirety and without prejudice.

The

Merckel

complaint names as defendants certain current and former officers, directors,
and employees of the Company and HBC, including Rodney C. Sacks, Hilton H.
Schlosberg, Harold C.

Taber, Jr.,
Benjamin M. Polk, Norman C. Epstein, Mark S. Vidergauz, Sydney Selati, Thomas
J. Kelly, Mark J. Hall, and Kirk S. Blower, as well as the administrator of the
Estate of Michael B. Schott and Hilrod Holdings, L.P.   The Company
is named as a nominal defendant.  The factual allegations of the complaint
are substantially similar to those set forth in the two securities class action
complaints described above.  The complaint also alleges, among other
things, that between May 2007 and the date of the filing of the complaint,
the defendants directed the Company to issue a series of improper statements
concerning its business prospects. The complaint further alleges that while the
Company’s shares were purportedly artificially inflated because of those
improper statements, certain defendants sold Company stock while in possession
of material non-public information regarding the Company’s “true” business
prospects. The complaint asserts various causes of action, including breach of
fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Cal.
Corp. Code §§ 25402 and 25403 for insider selling, and unjust enrichment. The
suit seeks an unspecified amount of damages to be paid to the Company, adoption
of corporate governance reforms, and equitable and injunctive relief.

On December 4, 2008, Plaintiff in the

Merckel

action filed a motion to consolidate that action
with another lawsuit involving similar allegations filed in the Central
District of California, styled

Dislevy v. Sacks, et al.

The

Dislevy

complaint, which names some but not all of the defendants in the

Merckel

action, has not been served.  A hearing on the motion to consolidate is expected
for March 2009.  If the motion to
consolidate is granted, defendants must respond within 45 days after the filing
and service of a consolidated amended complaint.  If the motion to consolidate is denied,
defendants must respond to the

Merckel

complaint within 45 days from entry of the order denying the motion or from the
filing of any amended complaint, whichever is later.

On February 17, 2009, Plaintiff in the

Merckel

action voluntarily dismissed The Estate of Michael
B. Schott from the action without prejudice.

Although
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, the
Company believes that the complaints are without merit. The Company intends to
vigorously defend against these lawsuits.

Guarantees

– The Company from
time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require
the Company to indemnify parties against third party claims.  These contracts primarily relate to: (i) certain
agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and employees under which the
Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out
of their employment relationship, (ii) certain distribution or purchase
agreements under which the Company may have to indemnify the Company’s
customers from any claim, liability or loss arising out of any actual or
alleged injury or damages suffered in connection with the consumption or
purchase of the Company’s products, and (iii) certain real estate leases,
under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for
liabilities and other claims arising from the Company’s use of the applicable
premises. The terms of such obligations vary and typically, a maximum
obligation is not explicitly stated. Generally, the Company believes that its
insurance coverage is adequate to cover any liabilities or claims arising out
of such instances. Consequently, the Company does not believe the fair value of
these guarantees is material to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Other Matters –

Commencing in fiscal 2006, a special committee (the “Special Committee”) of the
Board of Directors of the Company, assisted by
independent legal counsel and accounting advisors retained by the Special
Committee, conducted an independent investigation of the Company’s stock
option grants and stock option granting practices during the period January 1,
2001 through November 13, 2006, which resulted in a pre-tax compensation
charge of approximately $1.3 million related to certain unintentional
accounting errors.  Such charge was
recorded in operating expenses for the year


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands,
Except Per Share Amounts)

ended
December 31, 2006.  The Company has
elected to compensate employees with outstanding stock options that were
affected by such errors for all additional taxes, interest and penalties
payable by them pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, a charge of
approximately $2.8 million was recorded in operating expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2007 and is included accrued liabilities at December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

The Company has two stock option
plans under which shares were available for grant at December 31, 2008:
the Hansen Natural Corporation Amended and Restated 2001 Stock Option Plan (the
“2001 Option Plan”) and the 2005 Hansen Natural Corporation Stock Option Plan
for Non-Employee Directors (the “2005 Directors Plan”).

The 2001 Option Plan
permits the granting of options to purchase up to 22,000,000 shares of the
common stock of the Company to certain key employees or non-employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries.  Options
granted under the 2001 Option Plan may be incentive stock options under Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, non-qualified stock options or stock
appreciation rights.  Stock options are
exercisable at such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company up to a ten-year period
after their date of grant.  As of December 31,
2008, options to purchase 17,478,200 shares of the Company’s common stock had been
granted, net of cancellations, and options to purchase 4,521,800 shares of the
Company’s common stock remain available for grant under the 2001 Option Plan.

The 2005 Directors Plan permits the granting of options to purchase up
to an aggregate of 800,000 shares of common stock of the Company to
non-employee directors of the Company. 
On the date of the annual meeting of stockholders at which an eligible
director is initially elected, each eligible director is entitled to receive a
one-time grant of an option to purchase 24,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock exercisable at the closing price for a share of common stock on the date
of grant. Additionally, on the fifth anniversary of the election of eligible
directors elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, and each fifth
anniversary thereafter, each eligible director shall receive an additional
grant of an option to purchase 19,200 shares of the Company’s common
stock.  Options become exercisable in
four equal installments, with the grant immediately vested with respect to 25%
of the grant and the remaining installments vesting on the three successive
anniversaries of the date of grant; provided that all options held by an
eligible director become fully and immediately exercisable upon a change in
control of the Company.  Options granted
under the 2005 Directors Plan that are not exercised generally expire ten years
after the date of grant.  Option grants
may be made under the 2005 Directors Plan for ten years from the effective date
of the 2005 Directors Plan.  The 2005
Directors Plan is a “formula plan” so that a non-employee director’s
participation in the 2005 Directors Plan does not affect his status as a “disinterested
person” (as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”)).  As of December 31,
2008, options to purchase 76,800 shares of the Company’s common stock had been
granted under the 2005 Directors Plan and options to purchase 723,200 shares of
the Company’s common stock remained available for grant.

Under the Company’s stock option
plans, all grants are made at prices based on the fair market value of the
options on the date of grant. 
Outstanding options generally vest over five years from the grant date
and generally expire up to ten years after the grant date. The Company recorded
$13.9 million, $10.2 million and $8.3 million of compensation expense relating
to outstanding options during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

Major components
of the Company’s deferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31 are as
follows:

A valuation allowance is required to be provided to reduce the deferred
tax assets to a level which, more likely than not, will be realized.  The Company’s net deferred tax assets were
not reduced by tax valuation allowances at December 31, 2008 and
2007.  Management evaluated the positive
and negative evidence in determining the realizability of the net deferred tax
assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 and concluded it is more likely than
not that the Company should realize its net deferred tax assets through future
operating results and the reversal of taxable temporary differences.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of
FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN
No. 48”).  FIN No. 48 clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109.  FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return.  This pronouncement also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.

Upon adoption of FIN No. 48 as of January 1, 2007, the
Company’s reassessment of its tax positions did not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements. 
The following is a rollforward of the Company’s total gross unrecognized
tax benefits, not including interest and penalties, for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007 (in thousands):

The gross unrealized tax benefits, if
recognized, would result in a reduction of the Company’s provision and
effective tax rate. With the adoption of FIN No. 48, the Company has
decided to classify interest and penalties as a component of tax expense.  Interest and penalties of $0.2 million on
unrecognized tax benefits were accrued as a component of tax expense as of December 31,
2008.  All of the FIN No. 48
liabilities accrued are attributable to the Domestic Production Deduction.  The Company believes that the uncertainty
which gives rise to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit at December 31,
2008, will be resolved within the next 12 months as the Internal Revenue
Service concludes its examination of the deduction.

On
August 9, 2007, the Internal
Revenue Service began its examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax
return for the period ended December 31, 2005.  The examination is expected to be completed
within the next twelve months.

The
Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income tax of
multiple state jurisdictions. Federal income tax returns of the Company are
subject to IRS examination for the 2005 through 2007 tax years. State income
tax returns are subject to examination for the 2004 through 2007 tax years.
