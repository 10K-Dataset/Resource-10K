ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Background of the Company and Subsidiaries

     Hansen  Natural  Corporation   ("Hansen"  or  the  "Company"),   which  was
incorporated  in Delaware on April 25, 1990,  maintains its  principal  place of
business at 1010 Railroad Street,  Corona,  California  92882, and its telephone
number is (909) 739-6200.

     The  Company is a holding  company  and  carries on no  operating  business
except through its direct  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  Hansen Beverage  Company
("HBC") which was  incorporated  in Delaware on June 8, 1992 and Hard e Beverage
Company  ("HEB")  which was  incorporated  in  Delaware on April 30,  1990.  HBC
conducts the vast  majority of the  Company's  operating  business and generates
substantially all of the Company's operating revenues.  During the third quarter
of 2000, the Company,  through HEB, introduced a malt-based drink under the name
Hard e which  contains  up to  five-percent  alcohol.  The Hard e product is not
marketed under the Hansen's name. References herein to "Hansen" or the "Company"
when used to describe the  operating  business of the Company are  references to
the business of HBC unless otherwise indicated and references herein to HEB when
used to describe the  operating  business of HEB, are  references  to the Hard e
brand business of HEB unless otherwise indicated.

     HBC,  in 2000,  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Blue  Sky  Natural
Beverage Co., ("Blue Sky"),  which was  incorporated in Delaware on September 8,
2000,  acquired  full  ownership  of and  operates  the  natural  soda  business
previously  conducted by Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co., a New Mexico corporation
("BSNBC"),   under  the  Blue  Sky(R)  trademark.  In  2001,  HBC,  through  its
wholly-owned subsidiary Hansen Junior Juice Company, ("Junior Juice"), which was
incorporated in Delaware on May 7, 2001, acquired full ownership of and operates
the Junior Juice business  previously  conducted by Pasco Juices, Inc. ("Pasco")
under the Junior Juice(R) trademark.

Background of the Hansen Business

     In the 1930's,  Hubert Hansen and his three sons started a business to sell
fresh  non-pasteurized  juices  in  Los  Angeles,   California.   This  business
eventually became Hansen's Juices,  Inc., which subsequently became known as The
Fresh Juice Company of California, Inc. ("FJC"). In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of the
grandsons of Hubert Hansen,  perceived a demand for  pasteurized  natural juices
and juice blends that are shelf stable and formed  Hansen Foods,  Inc.  ("HFI"),
which was also based in the Los Angeles area. HFI expanded its product line from
juices to include Hansen's(R) Natural Sodas.  California Co-packers  Corporation
(d/b/a/  Hansen  Beverage  Company)  ("CCC")  acquired  certain  assets  of  HFI
including  the right to market the  Hansen's(R)  brand name, in January 1990. On
July 27, 1992, the Company,  through HBC, acquired the Hansen's(R) brand natural
soda and apple  juice  business  (the  "Hansen  Business")  from CCC.  Under the
Company's  ownership,  the Hansen  Business has been  significantly  expanded to
include a wide range of  beverages  within the  growing  "alternative"  beverage
category.  On  September  20,  2000,  HBC  acquired  the Blue Sky  Natural  Soda
business,  through its wholly owned  subsidiary  Blue Sky, from BSNBC and on May
25,  2001,  HBC acquired  the Junior  Juice  business,  through its wholly owned
subsidiary Junior Juice, from Pasco.

Products

     Hansen is engaged in the business of  marketing,  selling and  distributing
so-called  "alternative"  beverage category natural sodas,  fruit juices,  fruit
juice and soy Smoothies, energy drinks, "functional drinks", sparkling lemonades
and  orangeades,  non-carbonated  ready-to-drink  iced  teas,  lemonades,  juice
cocktails and energy sports drinks,  children's  multi-vitamin  juice drinks and
non-carbonated  lightly flavored energy waters under the Hansen's(R)  brand name
as well as  nutrition  bars and cereals also under the  Hansen's(R)  brand name,
natural sodas,  premium natural sodas with  supplements,  organic natural sodas,




seltzer waters and energy drinks under the Blue Sky(R) brand name,  fruit juices
for toddlers  under the Junior  Juice(R)  brand name and malt based drinks under
the Hard e (TM) brand name.

     The alternative  beverage category combines  non-carbonated  ready-to-drink
iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single serve juices,  ready-to-drink iced
coffees,  energy drinks,  sports drinks, soy drinks and single-serve still water
(flavored and  unflavored)  with "new age"  beverages,  including sodas that are
considered  natural,   sparkling  juices  and  flavored  sparkling  waters.  The
alternative  beverage  category is the fastest  growing  segment of the beverage
marketplace. (Source: Beverage Marketing Corporation). Sales for the alternative
beverage  category of the market are  estimated  to have  reached  approximately
$11.7 billion at wholesale in 2001 with a growth rate of approximately  14% over
Beverage  Marketing's  revised  estimate  for  2000 of $10.3  billion.  (Source:
Beverage Marketing Corporation).

     Hansen's(R)  Natural Sodas are  classified as "new age"  beverages and have
been a leading natural soda brand in Southern  California for the past 24 years.
In 2001,  Hansen's(R)  Natural  Sodas had the  highest  sales  among  comparable
carbonated  new age category  beverages  measured by unit volume in the Southern
California market (Source:  Information  Resources,  Inc.'s Analyzer Reports for
Southern  California).  Hansen's(R)  Natural  Sodas are  currently  available in
thirteen  regular  flavors  consisting of Mandarin Lime,  Key Lime,  Grapefruit,
Raspberry,  Creamy Root Beer, Vanilla Cola, Cherry Vanilla Creme,  Orange Mango,
Kiwi  Strawberry,  Tropical  Passion,  Black Cherry,  Ginger Ale and  Tangerine.
Hansen  discontinued  its low calorie sodas in Wildberry and Cola flavors and at
the end of  2000/beginning  of 2001,  introduced  a new line of diet  sodas with
Splenda(R) sweetener as the primary sweetener.  This line was introduced in four
flavors:  Peach,  Black Cherry,  Tangerine  Lime, and Kiwi  Strawberry.  A fifth
flavor,  Ginger Ale, was introduced recently.  Hansen's(R) Natural Sodas contain
no preservatives, sodium, caffeine or artificial coloring and are made with high
quality  natural  flavors,  citric acid and high  fructose corn syrup or, in the
case of its diet sodas,  with Splenda(R) and Acesulfame K.  Hansen's(R)  Natural
Sodas are currently packaged in 12-ounce aluminum cans.

     In January  1999,  Hansen's  introduced  its new premium  line of Signature
Sodas  in  unique  proprietary  14-ounce  glass  bottles.  Signature  Sodas  are
currently  available in six flavors  consisting of Orange Creme,  Vanilla Creme,
Ginger Beer,  Sasparilla,  Black Cherry and Sangria.  Signature  Sodas are being
marketed in certain areas through the Company's existing distributor network and
in others directly through its warehouse division.

     During  September  2000,  the Company  acquired  the Blue Sky Natural  Soda
business from BSNBC. The Blue Sky product line comprises  natural sodas in cans,
which are  available  in  thirteen  regular  flavors  consisting  of Lemon Lime,
Grapefruit,  Cola,  Root Beer,  Raspberry,  Cherry Vanilla Creme,  Truly Orange,
Jamaican Ginger Ale, Black Cherry,  Orange Creme, Dr. Becker,  Grape and Private
Reserve  Cream Soda.  Blue Sky also has a premium line of natural  sodas,  which
contain  supplements  such as Ginseng.  This line is currently  available in six
flavors  consisting of Ginseng Creme,  Ginseng Cola,  Ginseng Root Beer, Ginseng
Very Berry Creme,  Ginseng Ginger Ale, and Ginseng  Cranberry-Raspberry.  During
1999, Blue Sky introduced a line of organic  natural sodas,  which are currently
available  in six  flavors  consisting  of Prime Lime Cream,  New Century  Cola,
Orange Divine,  Ginger Gale,  Black Cherry  Cherish,  and Root Beer. The Company
also  markets  a  seltzer  water  under the Blue Sky  label.  In 2002,  Blue Sky
introduced a lightly  carbonated energy drink in an 8.3-ounce slim can. The Blue
Sky products contain no preservatives, sodium or caffeine (other than its energy
drink) or artificial  coloring and are made with high quality  natural  flavors.
All Blue Sky Natural Sodas and seltzer waters are currently packaged in 12-ounce
aluminum cans.

     During  April 1997,  the Company  introduced  a lightly  carbonated  citrus
flavored Hansen's(R) energy drink in an 8.3-ounce slim can. The Company's energy
drink  falls  within the  category  that has  generally  been  described  as the
"functional"  beverage  category,  namely,  beverages  that  provide  a real  or
perceived  benefit in  addition  to simply  delivering  refreshment.  Management
believes  that the  "functional"  beverage  category has good growth  potential.
During the first quarter of 1998, the Company  extended its  functional  product
line by introducing  three additional  functional drinks in 8.3-ounce slim cans,
namely, a ginger flavored d-stress(R) drink, an orange flavored anti-ox(R) drink




(since  renamed  b-well(TM)),  and a guarana berry  flavored  stamina(R)  drink.
During  the  fourth  quarter  of 1998,  the  Company  introduced  its  power(TM)
functional drink in 8.3-ounce slim cans, which is currently  marketed in a grape
flavor. During 2000, the Company introduced slim-down(TM),  its sixth functional
drink. slim-down(TM) is a berry-flavored drink that has no calories. Each of the
Company's  functional  drinks  contains  different   combinations  of  vitamins,
minerals, nutrients, herbs and supplements ("supplements"). In 2001, the Company
introduced its original  energy drink in 8.3-ounce  glass bottles as well as two
additional lightly carbonated Energy drinks in 8.3-ounce slim cans in a Tropical
and Wild  Berry  flavor.  Also in 2001 the  Company  introduced  Energade(R),  a
non-carbonated Energy sports drink in 23.5-ounce cans in two flavors, citrus and
orange,  and E2O Energy Water(TM),  a non-carbonated  lightly flavored water, in
24-ounce P.E.T.  plastic bottles, in four flavors,  Tangerine,  Apple, Berry and
Lemon. Each of the above new drinks contain different combinations and levels of
supplements.

     The Company has concentrated on marketing its carbonated  functional drinks
and,  in  particular,  its  energy  drinks  including  Energade(R),  as  well as
Signature Sodas and Smoothies in glass bottles, through its distributor network.

     During  2001,  the Company  launched  its new premium  line of  alternative
healthy iced teas and drinks under the "Medicine  Man(R)"  label in  proprietary
glass bottles. Response from customers and consumers to the Medicine Man(R) line
was disappointing  and, in consequence,  the Company is presently  re-evaluating
this line.

     The  Company's  fruit juice  product line  currently  includes  Hansen's(R)
Natural Old  Fashioned  Apple  Juice which is packaged in 64-ounce  polyethylene
terephthalate  ("P.E.T.")  plastic  bottles and 128-ounce  polypropylene/lamicon
bottles and Apple  Strawberry  and Apple Grape juice  blends in 64-ounce  P.E.T.
plastic  bottles.  These juice blends were  introduced in the second  quarter of
1998. These  Hansen's(R) juice products contain 100% juice as well as 100% (120%
in the case of Apple  Juice)  of the  recommended  daily  intake  for  adults of
Vitamin C. Certain of these  products  also contain added  calcium.  Hansen's(R)
juice products  compete in the  shelf-stable  juice  category.  During 2001, the
Company  introduced an  Apple-Cranberry  juice blend, a Cranberry juice cocktail
and an  Orange-Carrot  juice blend in 64-ounce  P.E.T.  plastic  bottles.  These
products do not contain 100% juice.

     In March 1995, the Company expanded its juice product line by introducing a
line of fruit juice Smoothies. The Company's fruit juice Smoothies have a smooth
texture  that is thick but lighter than a nectar and contain  approximately  35%
juice (the juice levels of the Company's  Smoothies in glass and P.E.T.  plastic
bottles  is 25%).  The  Company's  fruit  juice  Smoothies  provide  100% of the
recommended daily intake for adults of Vitamins A, C & E (the antioxidant triad)
and  represented  Hansen's  entry  into  what  is  commonly  referred  to as the
"functional" beverage category. The Company's fruit juice Smoothies are packaged
in 11.5-ounce cans and in unique proprietary  12-ounce glass bottles designed by
the  Company,  as well as in  64-ounce  and  16-ounce  P.E.T.  plastic  bottles.
Hansen's(R)  fruit juice Smoothies are available in eleven  flavors:  Strawberry
Banana,  Peach Berry,  Mango Pineapple,  Guava  Strawberry,  Pineapple  Coconut,
Apricot Nectar, Tropical Passion,  Whipped Orange,  Cranberry Twist, a Cranberry
Raspberry lite as well as an Energy Smoothie with a unique formula.  The Company
extended its Smoothie line in 64-ounce  P.E.T.  plastic bottles from two flavors
to six  flavors  during 2000 but reduced  this line in 64-ounce  P.E.T.  plastic
bottles back to two flavors in 2001. In 2001, the Company  extended its Smoothie
line by introducing four flavors in 16-ounce P.E.T. plastic bottles.

     During  the  second  half of 1999,  the  Company  introduced  a new line of
premium  functional  Smoothies in 11.5-ounce cans:  Energy,  Power,  Protein and
Vita. Each of these products  contained  different  combinations of supplements.
Energy had a tropical  fruit  flavor.  Power had a berry  flavor.  Protein had a
banana  citrus  flavor.  Vita had an orange carrot  flavor.  The juice levels of
these  products were higher than the juice levels of the regular  Smoothie line.
During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company introduced  reformulated versions
of certain of these  products with lower juice levels as line  extensions to its
regular  Smoothie  line  in  12-ounce  glass  bottles.   In  2001,  the  Company
repositioned  these products as line extensions to its regular  Smoothie line in
11.5-ounce cans, by reformulating these products with lower juice levels.





     During the second quarter of 1998,  the Company  launched its first Healthy
Start product,  Dyna Juice(R),  a shelf stable 100% juice blend with 15 vitamins
and minerals added.  Dyna Juice(R) was renamed  VITAMAX-JUICE  during the fourth
quarter of 1998 to more directly communicate its attributes to consumers. During
the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company  expanded its Healthy Start product line
with three new Healthy Start 100% juices namely, ANTIOXJUICE(R),  IMMUNEJUICE(R)
and  INTELLIJUICE(R).  ANTIOXJUICE(R)  is a carrot  and  tropical  juice  blend,
IMMUNEJUICE(R) is an aronia and cranberry juice blend and  INTELLIJUICE(R) is an
orange and tomato  juice  blend.  Each of the  Healthy  Start  products  contain
different  combinations  of  supplements.  The Healthy Start line was originally
launched in 46-ounce  P.E.T.  plastic bottles and at the end of 1998 the Company
expanded this line into 64-ounce P.E.T.  plastic bottles as well. Early in 2000,
the Company entered into a licensing agreement with the Silver Foxes Network for
the licensing to the Company of the Silver Foxes(TM) brand and trademark,  which
is positioned towards consumers in the 50+ age group, for and in connection with
certain of the Company's products.  The Company determined to use that trademark
for and in connection  with its Healthy Start 100% juice line in P.E.T.  plastic
bottles.  The  Company  redesigned  the labels for its Silver  Foxes(TM)/Healthy
Start juice line and  relaunched the re-named line during 2000.  However,  sales
from such relaunched line were  disappointing  and the Company is  discontinuing
the entire line.

     In the first quarter of 2000, the Company introduced its Healthy Start 100%
juice line in single-  serve  glass  bottles,  which was  marketed  through  its
distributor  network.  However,  response  from  distributors  and consumers was
disappointing and the Company is discontinuing this line.

     Hansen's(R) ready-to-drink iced teas and lemonades were introduced in 1993.
Hansen's(R) ready-to-drink iced teas and juice cocktails are currently available
in three flavors:  Original with Lemon, Tropical Peach and Wildberry.  Lemonades
are  currently  available  in  one  flavor:  Original  Old  Fashioned  Lemonade.
Hansen's(R) juice cocktails were introduced in 1994 and are currently  available
in four flavors: Kiwi Strawberry Melon,  Tangerine Pineapple with Passion Fruit,
California  Paradise Punch and Mango Magic. The Company introduced a new 12-pack
variety  pack of iced teas  during  the first  half of 2001,  which  experienced
limited  success.  The Company  will  continue  to market this  package in 2002.
Hansen's  ready-to-drink iced teas,  lemonades and juice cocktails are currently
packaged in 16-ounce wide-mouth glass bottles.

     Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink  iced teas are made with decaffeinated tea. The
Company's  other  non-carbonated  products  are made with high  quality  juices.
Hansen's(R)  non-carbonated  products  (other than its 100% juice  products) are
also made with natural flavors,  high fructose corn syrup, citric acid and other
ingredients.

     After offering a ready-to-drink  green tea in a 20-ounce glass bottle,  the
Company  introduced a full line of  Specialty  teas in 20-ounce  glass  bottles,
which it named  its  "Gold  Standard"  line.  This  line was  introduced  in the
20-ounce  glass  bottles that were being used by the Company at the time,  while
the  Company  proceeded  with  the  design  and  manufacture  of  a  new  unique
proprietary 20-ounce glass bottle for the line, which was introduced towards the
end of 1999.  During  2000,  the Company  introduced  two  additional  green tea
flavors, as well as two diet green flavors,  and six juice cocktails in 20-ounce
bottles.  All of the  products  in the  Gold  Standard  line  contain  different
combinations  of  supplements,  but  at  lower  levels  than  in  the  Company's
functional drinks.

     In the third  quarter  of 1999,  the  Company  introduced  two new lines of
children's multi-vitamin juice drinks in 8.45-ounce aseptic packages. Each drink
contains eleven  essential  vitamins and six essential  minerals.  Each line was
introduced  in three  flavors.  The  Company  has,  since that time,  introduced
additional flavors and intends to continue to introduce new flavors in the place
of existing  flavors from time to time. One of these two lines is a dual-branded
100% juice line named "Juice  Blast(R)"  that was launched in  conjunction  with
Costco     Wholesale     Corporation     ("Costco")    under    the    "Kirkland
Signature(TM)/Hansen's(R)  Natural"  brand name and is sold  nationally  through
Costco stores.  The other line was a 10% juice line named "Juice  Slam(TM)" that
was  available  to  all  of  Hansen's   customers.   During  2000,  the  Company
repositioned that line as a 100% juice line under the Juice Slam(TM) name and is




currently marketing that line to grocery store chain customers,  the health food
trade, and other customers.

     In 2000, the Company introduced a new line of nutrition food bars under the
Hansen's(R)  brand name.  This line is made from grains and fruit.  In addition,
the Company  introduced a new line of premium G.M.O. free (free from genetically
modified  organisms)  cereals under the Hansen's(R) brand name. During the first
half of 2001, the Company introduced a line of functional food bars, and towards
the end of the year  introduced  a line of  active  nutrition  bars,  which  are
specially formulated for adults 50+.

     In 2001, the Company introduced a new line of sparkling  lemonades (regular
and  pink)  and   orangeades  in  1-liter  glass  bottles  and  a  new  line  of
Soy-Smoothies in 1-liter and 11-ounce aseptic  packaging in five flavors:  Berry
Splash,  Tropical  Breeze,  Orange Dream,  Lemon Chiffon and Peach Passion.  The
sparkling  lemonades  and  orangeades  contain  real  juice and pulp and the Soy
Smoothies contain soy protein and fruit juices.

     On May  25,  2001,  the  Company  acquired  the  Junior  Juice(R)  beverage
business.  The Junior Juice product line comprises  seven flavors of 100% juices
in  4.23-ounce  aseptic  packages and is targeted at toddlers.  The Junior Juice
line has  calcium  and  vitamin C added  (excluding  White  Grape which only has
vitamin C added).

     During the third quarter of 2000, the Company introduced a malt-based drink
under the name Hard e, which  contains up to  five-percent  alcohol.  The Hard e
product is not marketed under the Hansen's name.

     Hansen's(R) still water products were introduced in 1993. Hansen's(R) still
water  products  are  primarily  sold in 0.5-liter  plastic  bottles to the food
service trade.

     The  Company  continues  to evaluate  and,  where  considered  appropriate,
introduce  additional  flavors and other types of  beverages to  complement  its
existing  product lines.  The Company will also evaluate,  and where  considered
appropriate,   introduce  functional  foods/snack  foods  that  utilize  similar
channels of  distribution  and/or are  complimentary  to the Company's  existing
products and/or to which the Hansen's(R) brand name is able to add value.

Manufacture, Production and Distribution

     The concentrates for Hansen's(R) Natural Soda,  Signature Soda and Blue Sky
Natural Soda products are blended at independent production facilities.  In each
case, the concentrate is delivered by independent trucking companies to Hansen's
various co-packers,  each of which adds filtered water, high fructose corn syrup
or cane sugar or, in the case of the diet  sodas,  Splenda(R)  brand  sweetener,
Acesulfame K, citric acid, and carbonation and, where appropriate,  supplements,
and packages  the products in approved  containers.  Hansen's  most  significant
co-packing   arrangement   is  with  Southwest   Canning  and  Packaging,   Inc.
("Southwest")  pursuant to a contract under which Southwest packages Hansen's(R)
Natural  Sodas.  This  arrangement  continues  indefinitely  and is  subject  to
termination on 60 days written notice from either party.

     The Company purchases juices,  concentrates,  flavors, vitamins,  minerals,
nutrients,  herbs,  supplements and other ingredients for its remaining beverage
products including, but not limited to, juice products, ready-to-drink iced tea,
lemonade and juice  cocktail  products,  Gold  Standard  specialty tea and juice
cocktail line, fruit juice and soy Smoothie products,  Energy drinks, functional
drinks, Energade energy sports drinks, E2O Energy Water, sparkling lemonades and
orangeades, children's multi-vitamin juice drinks and Junior Juice products from
various  producers and  manufacturers.  Such materials are then delivered to the
Company's  various  co-packers,  who add water and/or high  fructose  corn syrup
and/or sucrose, for manufacture and packaging of the finished products.



     The  ingredients  for the Company's  fruit and grain  nutrition  food bars,
functional  food bars and active  nutrition  bars are purchased by the Company's
co-packers for  manufacturing  and packaging of the finished bars. The Company's
cereal  products are  manufactured  for the Company by an overseas  supplier who
supplies all of the ingredients therefor.

     All of the Company's  beverage products are co-packed by various co-packers
situated  throughout the United States and Canada under  separate  arrangements,
each of which continue on a  month-to-month  basis,  except for the arrangements
with Southwest,  which is described above,  and Reflo,  Inc., which is described
below.

     The Company has secured  arrangements with certain co-packers and suppliers
in respect of equipment purchased by the Company and installed at the facilities
of such co-packers and suppliers for the specific  purpose of  facilitating  the
production of certain of the Company's products.

     The Company's natural sodas, juice products,  iced tea, lemonade, and juice
cocktail products and Gold Standard Specialty tea and juice cocktail line, fruit
juice and soy Smoothie products in cans,  aseptic packaging and P.E.T.  bottles,
sparkling  lemonades  and  orangeades,  children's  multi-vitamin  juice drinks,
Junior Juice  products,  Blue Sky products  and  nutrition  bars and cereals are
primarily sold to major grocery chain stores and, in certain instances,  to mass
merchandisers through food brokers; to club stores,  specialty chain stores and,
in certain instances,  mass merchandisers  directly by Hansen; and to the health
food trade through specialty health food distributors.  In Colorado,  a licensed
distributor  is  responsible  for sales of  certain of the above  products.  The
Company's  fruit  juice  Smoothie  products  in glass  bottles,  Energy  drinks,
functional drinks, Energade energy sports drinks, E2O Energy Water and Signature
Sodas are distributed almost exclusively by bottlers and/or distributors that do
not distribute  other  products of the Company.  However,  from 2001,  Signature
Sodas have also been sold to major grocery chain stores,  mass merchandisers and
club stores, in certain states and/or counties directly by Hansen's.

     Management has secured limited additional  co-packing  arrangements outside
the West to enable the Company to produce  certain of its products closer to the
markets  where they are sold and thereby  reduce  freight  costs.  As volumes in
markets outside  California grow, the Company will secure additional  co-packing
arrangements to further reduce freight costs.

     The Company's  ability to estimate demand is imprecise,  particularly  with
new  products,  and  may  be  less  precise  during  periods  of  rapid  growth,
particularly in new markets. If the Company materially underestimates demand for
its  products or is unable to secure  sufficient  ingredients  or raw  materials
including,   but  not  limited  to,  glass,   cans  or  labels,   or  co-packing
arrangements,  it might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. See
also "Item 7 - Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations."

     Although the  Company's  arrangements  for  production  of its products are
generally of short duration or are terminable upon request,  management believes
that,  subject to what is stated herein,  a short  disruption or delay would not
significantly  affect  the  Company's  revenues  since  alternative   co-packing
facilities in the United  States with adequate  capacity can usually be obtained
for many of its  products  at  commercially  reasonable  rates  and/or  within a
reasonably short time period.  However,  there are limited co-packing facilities
in the United  States with  adequate  capacity for many of the  Company's  newer
products, including its Energy drinks, functional drinks, Energade products, E2O
Energy Water, soy Smoothies,  fruit juice Smoothies in glass bottles,  sparkling
lemonades and orangeades,  Gold Standard line and aseptic juice products.  There
are also  limited  shrink  sleeve  labeling  facilities  available in the United
States with adequate  capacity for the  Company's  Signature  Soda line,  Energy
drinks  in  glass  bottles  and E2O  Energy  Water.  A  disruption  or  delay in
production  of any of such  products  could  significantly  affect the Company's
revenues from such products as alternative  co-packing  facilities in the United
States with adequate  capacity may not be available for such products  either at
commercially  reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if
at all. In  addition,  with  regard to the Hard e product,  while there are many
co-packing  facilities in the United  States with  adequate  capacity that could



produce such product,  due to regulatory  issues it may not be feasible for such
product to be co-packed at alternative  co-packaging facilities on short notice.
Consequently,  a disruption  in  production  of such  products  could affect the
Company's revenues from such products. The Company continues to seek alternative
co-packing  facilities in the United States or Canada with adequate capacity for
the production of certain of its products to minimize the risk of any disruption
in production.

     The Company itself is primarily  responsible  for marketing its products in
the United States.  The Company has entered into  distribution  agreements  with
distributors  to  distribute  Smoothies in glass  bottles  and/or  Energy drinks
and/or  functional drinks and/or Energade energy sports drinks and/or E2O Energy
Waters and/or  Signature  Sodas in 49 states.  In many of such states,  however,
distribution  is only on a limited  scale.  Certain of the  Company's  products,
particularly, Energy drinks, Signature Sodas and the Gold Standard line are also
marketed in Canada. Certain Hansen products are also marketed on a limited basis
in other countries  outside of the United States,  including the United Kingdom,
Mexico,  Philippines,  Germany, Japan, Guam, the Caribbean,  and the United Arab
Emirates.  During 2001, sales by the Company to distributors  outside the United
States amounted to approximately $1,233,000.

     The Company intends to aggressively expand the distribution of its products
into new markets, both within the United States and abroad.

     The Company has developed a separate network of brokers and distributors to
support the introduction,  sale and distribution of the Company's nutrition bars
and cereals,  sparkling lemonades and orangeades and soy Smoothies to the health
food trade,  convenience  and drug store  chains,  grocery chain stores and mass
merchandisers.

     The Company is continuing to expand distribution of its products by seeking
to enter into agreements  with regional  bottlers or other direct store delivery
distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.
Hansen's  licensed bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture
and/or  distribute  other  soda and  non-carbonated  brands  and other  beverage
products.  In many  cases,  such  products  are  directly  competitive  with the
Company's  products.  The  Company's  previous  strategy of  licensing  regional
bottlers to produce Hansen's(R)  Natural Sodas from concentrate  provided by the
Company,  did not fulfill  management's  expectations,  partly because  bottlers
preferred to focus on alternative  beverage  products having higher margins than
sodas.

     During  2001,  the  Company  continued  to expand the  distribution  of its
Natural Sodas and Smoothies in cans into Oregon and Washington. In these states,
the  Company  has  retained  responsibility  for  securing  sales and  providing
marketing  support.  To this end, the Company appointed a regional sales manager
for the northwestern states during 2000.

     In 2001,  the  Company  continued  to expand its  national  sales  force to
support  and  grow  sales  primarily  of  Energy  drinks,   functional   drinks,
Energade(R),  E2O Energy Water,  Smoothies in glass bottles and Signature  Sodas
and intends to continue to build such sales force during 2002.

     The Blue  Sky(R)  products  are sold  primarily  to the  health  food trade
through specialty health food distributors.

     Hard e malt based drinks are manufactured for HEB by Reflo, Inc. ("Reflo"),
pursuant to a  manufacturing  and  distribution  agreement dated as of March 23,
2000  ("Reflo  Agreement").  Either  party  may  elect to  terminate  the  Reflo
Agreement at any time on 90 days notice. Under the terms of the Reflo Agreement,
Reflo  administers the sales and  distribution  of such products  throughout the
United States,  excluding  Arizona,  California,  Nevada and Oregon where HEB is
itself  responsible for the sales and  distribution of such products.  Hard e is
currently  being  distributed  in 14 states.  However,  in many of such  states,
distribution is on an extremely limited scale.

     Management  continues  to  evaluate  various  alternatives  to  expand  the
distribution of its products into selected new markets.



     The principal  warehouse and distribution  center and corporate  offices of
the Company  relocated to the Company's  current  facility in October 2000.  The
Company  is  continuing  to take  steps to  reduce  its  inventory  levels in an
endeavor  to lower its  warehouse  and  distribution  costs.  See also "ITEM 2 -
PROPERTIES."

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

     The  Company   purchases   beverage  flavors,   concentrates,   juices  and
supplements from independent  suppliers located in the United States, Mexico and
abroad,  bars and other  ingredients  from  independent  suppliers in the United
States and abroad, and cereals from an independent supplier located abroad.

     Suppliers regard flavors as proprietary to them. Consequently,  Hansen does
not  currently  have the list of  ingredients  or  formulae  for its flavors and
certain of its concentrates  readily available to it and may be unable to obtain
these flavors or concentrates  from alternative  suppliers on short notice.  The
Company  has  identified  alternative  suppliers  of  many  of  the  supplements
contained in many of its beverages and bars. However, industry-wide shortages of
certain supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the
future, be experienced,  which could interfere with production of certain of the
Company's products.

     Management is continuing  with its attempts to develop  back-up  sources of
supply for certain of its flavors and concentrates  from other suppliers as well
as to conclude  arrangements  with  suppliers  which  would  enable it to obtain
access to certain concentrates or product formulae in certain circumstances. The
Company has been partially successful in these endeavors.

     Hansen's goal is to ensure that the raw materials  used in the  manufacture
and packaging of the Company's products, including natural sodas, Energy drinks,
Energade  energy  sport  drinks,  E2O  Energy  Water,  Blue Sky  natural  sodas,
Signature  sodas,  functional  drinks  and  non-carbonated  drinks  and  juices,
including,  but not limited to,  concentrates  and juices,  high  fructose  corn
syrup,  cane sugar,  citric acid,  caps,  cans,  glass bottles,  P.E.T.  plastic
bottles,  aseptic  packaging and labels,  are readily available from two or more
sources and is  continuing  its efforts to achieve this goal,  although  each of
such raw  materials  are, in practice,  usually  obtained  from single  sources.
However,  the cans for the  Company's  Energy  and  functional  drinks  are only
manufactured by one company in the United States.  Additionally,  the ability of
HEB to have its Hard e products manufactured and/or distributed by other parties
may be restricted by HEB's  agreement with Reflo,  Inc.  and/or the necessity to
obtain certain regulatory approvals and licenses.

     In connection with the development of new products and flavors, the Company
works with  independent  suppliers  who bear a large  portion of the  expense of
product  development,  thereby  enabling the Company to develop new products and
flavors at  relatively  low cost.  The Company has  historically  developed  and
successfully  introduced new products and flavors and packaging for its products
and currently  anticipates  developing and introducing  additional new beverages
and food products and flavors.

Competition

     The  beverage  industry  is  highly  competitive.  The  principal  areas of
competition are pricing, packaging,  development of new products and flavors and
marketing campaigns. The Company's products compete with traditional soft drinks
(cola and non-cola), and alternative beverages,  including new age beverages and
ready-to-drink  iced teas,  lemonades  and juice  cocktails and energy drinks as
well as juices and juice  drinks and  nectars  produced  by a  relatively  large
number of manufacturers,  most of which have  substantially  greater  financial,
marketing and distribution resources than Hansen.

     The Company's  Energy  drinks  compete  directly with Red Bull,  Red Devil,
Lipovitan,  MET-Rx,  Hype, XTC, Adrenaline Rush, 180, KMX, Amp, Venom,  Extreeme
Energy  Shot and many  other  brands  and its other  functional  drinks  compete
directly with Elix, Lipovitan,  MET-Rx, Think, Sobe Essentials and other brands.



Over the past year or so the Company  has  experienced  substantial  competition
from new entrants in the Energy drink category. A number of companies who market
and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in larger volume packages,  such as
16- and 20-ounce glass bottles,  including Sobe,  Snapple  Elements and Arizona,
have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their products
as "functional" or "Energy" beverages or as having functional benefits. However,
many of those  products  are believed to contain low levels of  supplements  and
principally  deliver  refreshment.  In addition,  many competitive  products are
positioned  differently  than the  Company's  functional  drinks.  The Company's
"functional"  Smoothies  and Gold  Standard  lines are  positioned  more closely
against those products.

     For its Natural Sodas,  Smoothies,  Energy drinks,  Energade  energy sports
drinks, E2O Energy Water, functional drinks and Signature sodas as well as other
products, Hansen competes not only for consumer acceptance, but also for maximum
marketing efforts by multi-brand  licensed  bottlers,  brokers and distributors,
many of which have a principal  affiliation with competing companies and brands.
The Company's products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of
much  larger  and  substantially  better  financed  competitors,  including  the
products of numerous nationally and internationally  known producers such as The
Coca  Cola  Company,   PepsiCo,  Inc.,  Cadbury  Schwepps,  which  includes  Dr.
Pepper/Seven-up,  RC Cola, Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's brands, Nestle Beverage
Company,  Anheuser  Busch and Ocean  Spray.  More  specifically,  the  Company's
products compete with other alternative beverages,  including new age beverages,
such as Snapple, Mistic, Arizona, Clearly Canadian, Sobe, Stewart's,  Everfresh,
Nantucket Nectars, Kerns Nectars,  Mistic,  VeryFine, V8 Splash,  Calistoga, Red
Bull,  Adrenaline  Rush, Amp, 180, KMX, MET Rx, Venom,  Extreeme Energy Shot and
Crystal  Geyser  brands.  Due to the rapid  growth of the  alternative  beverage
segment of the beverage  marketplace,  certain large  companies such as The Coca
Cola Company and PepsiCo,  Inc. have introduced  products in that market segment
which compete  directly with the Company's  products such as Nestea,  Fruitopia,
Lipton and Dole.  The Company's  products also compete with private label brands
such as those carried by grocery store chains and club stores.

     The Company's fruit juice  Smoothies  compete with Kern's and Jumex nectars
in the Western  states and Libby's in the  Eastern  states and Whipper  Snapple,
Mistic  and  Nantucket  Nectars  nationally  and also with  single  serve  juice
products produced by many competitors. Such competitive products are packaged in
glass and P.E.T.  bottles ranging from 8- to 20-ounces in size and in 11.5-ounce
aluminum cans. The juice content of such competitive  products ranges from 1% to
100%.

     The Company's  apple and other juice  products  compete  directly with Tree
Top, Mott's, Martinelli's, Welsh's, Ocean Spray, Minute Maid, Langers, Apple and
Eve,  Seneca,  Northland  and also with  other  brands of apple  juice and juice
blends,  especially store brands. The Company's Healthy Start line competes with
Langer's,  V8 Splash,  Knudsen,  Nantucket  Nectars,  Wildland  and other  juice
products.  The  Company's  E2O Energy  Water and still  water  products  compete
directly with Vitamin  Water,  Reebok,  Propel,  Evian,  Crystal  Geyser,  Naya,
Palomar Mountain,  Sahara, Arrowhead,  Aquafina, Dannon, Dasani and other brands
of still water especially store brands.

     The nutrition food bar and cereal categories as well as flavored malt-based
drink categories are also highly competitive. Principal areas of competition are
pricing,  packaging,  development  of new  products  and flavors  and  marketing
campaigns.  The Company's cereals compete with traditional  cereals of companies
such as Kellogg's,  General Mills,  Kashi and Nature  Valley,  and the Company's
nutrition  food bars compete with  products of other  independent  bar companies
such as Power Bar, Balance Bar, Gatorade, Kashi, Cliff Bar, MET-Rx, and numerous
other bars.

     HEB's Hard e product  competes  with wine  coolers,  such as Seagram's  and
Bartles  and  James and  flavored  low  alcohol  beverages  such as Mike's  Hard
Lemonade,  Hooper's Hooch, Doc Otis Hard Lemonade, Smirnoff Ice, Zima and Rick's
Spiked Lemonade and other flavored malt and alcohol based drinks.  Many of these
products are produced by large national and international manufacturers, most of
which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources
than Hansen.  Such companies  include  Anheuser Busch,  Miller Brewing  Company,
Coors, Gallo Winery, Diageo plc, etc.



     Important  factors  affecting  Hansen's  ability  to  compete  successfully
include taste and flavor of products,  trade and consumer promotions,  rapid and
effective  development  of new,  unique  cutting edge  products,  attractive and
different  packaging,  branded  product  advertising  and  pricing.  Hansen also
competes  for  distributors  who will  concentrate  on marketing  the  Company's
products  over  those of  Hansen's  competitors,  provide  stable  and  reliable
distribution  and secure  adequate  shelf space in retail  outlets.  Competitive
pressures in the alternative,  energy and functional beverage categories as well
as in the cereal, nutrition food bar and flavored malt beverage categories could
cause the  Company's  products to be unable to gain or to lose  market  share or
experience price erosion, which could have a material adverse affect on Hansen's
business and results.

Marketing

     Hansen's marketing strategy is to focus on consumers who seek products that
are perceived to be natural and healthy. To attract these consumers, the Company
emphasizes the natural  ingredients  and the absence of  preservatives,  sodium,
artificial  coloring and  caffeine in the  Company's  beverages  (other than the
Company's Energy drinks,  Energade energy sports drinks,  functional  stamina(R)
and power drinks which contain  caffeine and/or sodium) and the addition to most
of its products,  of one or more supplements.  This message is reinforced in the
product  packaging,  the majority of which was redesigned from 2000. The regular
wholesale  price of  Hansen's(R)  Natural Sodas in cans is slightly  higher than
mainstream  soft drinks such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi,  although  generally  lower
than the prices of the products of many competitors in the new age category.  In
its marketing,  Hansen  emphasizes its high quality "natural" image and the fact
that its soda products contain no preservatives,  sodium, caffeine or artificial
coloring.  The regular wholesale price of the Company's iced teas, lemonades and
juice cocktails,  including its Gold Standard line, is comparable to or slightly
lower  than that of  competitive  non-carbonated  beverages  marketed  under the
Snapple,  Sobe, Arizona,  Mistic,  Lipton,  Nestea,  Fruitopia,  Ocean Spray and
Nantucket Nectar brands.  In its marketing,  Hansen  emphasizes the high quality
natural and healthy image of its products.  The regular  wholesale  price of the
Company's  fruit juice Smoothie  products is similar to that of Kern's  nectars.
Without abandoning its natural and healthy image, the Company launched a lightly
carbonated energy drink in 8.3-ounce slim cans,  containing certain supplements,
to appeal to the young and active segment of the beverage market that desires an
energy boost from its beverage selection. The Company subsequently launched five
additional   lightly   carbonated   functional   drinks,   namely,   stamina(R),
d-stress(R),  anti-ox(R) (since renamed b-well(TM)), power(TM) and slim-down(TM)
as well as two new energy drinks and in addition recently  launched  Energade(R)
energy sports drinks and E2O Energy Water. The supplements  contained in each of
those drinks are intended to provide specific but different  functional benefits
to the  consumers of each of such  products.  Hansen's  marketing  strategy with
respect  to its  nutrition  food  bars  and  cereals  is  similarly  to focus on
consumers  who seek  bars and  cereals  that are  perceived  to be  natural  and
healthy.  To  attract  these  consumers,  the  Company  emphasizes  the  natural
ingredients  and the absence of  preservatives  and, in the case of the cereals,
the fact that they are G.M.O.-free. HEB's marketing strategy with respect to its
Hard e product is to focus on adult consumers who seek an alcohol-based beverage
that is good tasting, fashionable and meets consumers' needs.

     To cater to consumers who purchase juices in multi-serve sizes and perceive
the inclusion of supplements  therein to be of added value, the Company launched
its  Healthy  Start line of 100%  juices in 1998.  Although  marketed  in larger
multi-serve packages that are appropriate for grocery store chains, club stores,
specialty  chains and health food stores,  the  positioning of these products is
similar to the Company's lightly carbonated  functional drinks in 8.3-ounce slim
cans.  To  distinguish  these  products  from those of  competitors,  each label
indicates  the function of the product,  in addition to listing the  supplements
contained  therein.  As stated above,  following  the  conclusion of a licensing
agreement  by the Company  with the Silver  Foxes  Network,  the Company had the
labels for its Silver  Foxes(TM)/Healthy  Start 100% juice line redesigned.  The
new renamed line, which was targeted at the 50+ age group, was relaunched during
2000.  However,  sales  of this  line  were  disappointing  and the  Company  is
discontinuing  this line.  During the year,  the  Company  also  introduced  its
Healthy  Start 100% line in single serve  12-ounce  glass  bottles,  through its
distributor  network.  Sales  of this  line did not  meet  expectations  and the
Company is also discontinuing this line.



     According to Roche  Vitamins,  very few American  children  meet all of the
recommendations of the Food Guide Pyramid. In 1999, the Company introduced a new
line of children's  multi-vitamin  juice drinks in 8.45-ounce aseptic packaging.
These  products are  positioned  to assist  parents  improve the daily intake by
their children of essential  vitamins and minerals.  In this regard,  the Junior
Juice  line,  which  is  aimed at  toddlers,  contains  calcium  and  vitamin  C
(excluding White Grape which only has vitamin C added).

     The  Company's  sales and  marketing  strategy  is to focus its  efforts on
developing  brand  awareness  and trial  through  sampling both in stores and at
events in respect of all its beverage, food and alcoholic beverage products. The
Company intends to continue to place increased  emphasis on product sampling and
participating in direct promotions.  The Company proposes to continue to use its
branded vehicles,  PT Cruisers and other promotional vehicles at events at which
the Company's products,  including its fruit juice smoothies,  natural sodas and
Energy  drinks,  Energade(R)  energy  sports drinks and E2O Energy Water will be
distributed to consumers for sampling.  Hansen utilizes  "push-pull"  tactics to
achieve  maximum shelf and display  space  exposure in sales outlets and maximum
demand  from  consumers  for  its  products  including  advertising,   in  store
promotions and point of sale  materials,  prize  promotions,  price  promotions,
competitions,  endorsements from selected public figures,  coupons, sampling and
sponsorship of selected  causes such as breast cancer research as well as sports
figures  and  sporting  events  such as  marathons,  10k  runs,  bicycle  races,
volleyball   tournaments  and  other  health-  and  sports-related   activities,
including extreme sports, and also participates in product demonstrations,  food
tasting  and  other  related  events.   Posters,  print,  radio  and  television
advertising together with price promotions and coupons are also used extensively
to promote the Hansen's(R) brand.

     Management  increased  expenditures for its sales and marketing programs by
approximately 20% in 2001 compared to 2000.

     While the Company  retains  responsibility  for the  marketing of the Juice
Slam(TM) line of children's  multi-vitamin  juice drinks,  Costco has undertaken
sole responsibility for the marketing of the co-branded Juice Blast(R) line.

     The Company intends to support its planned  expansion of  distribution  and
sale of its Energy drinks,  Energade(R)  energy sports drinks, E2O Energy Water,
Smoothies in glass bottles and Signature Sodas,  through the in-store  placement
of  point-of-sale  materials,  use of  glide  racks,  suction  cup  racks  and a
proprietary  rolling rack for its Energy drinks,  co-operative  trade  marketing
with customers and by attending and sponsoring many sporting  events,  including
extreme  sports and  selected  sports  figures  and  through  endorsements  from
selected  public and sports  figures,  through  focused  radio  campaigns and by
developing  local  marketing  programs in conjunction  with its  distributors in
their respective  markets.  By enlisting its distributors as participants in its
marketing and  advertising  programs,  Hansen  intends to create an  environment
conducive to the growth of both the Hansen's(R)  brand and the businesses of its
distributors.

     Management  continues  to  believe  that one of the keys to  success in the
beverage  industry  is  differentiation;  making  Hansen's(R)  products  clearly
distinctive  from other beverages on the shelves of retailers.  Management is of
the view  that the same keys to  success  apply to its  nutrition  food bars and
cereals and Hard e products.  The Company  reviews its products and packaging on
an ongoing basis and, where practical,  endeavors to make them different, better
and unique.  The labels and graphics for the Company's juice  products,  Natural
Sodas and  Smoothie  products  were  redesigned  in an endeavor to develop a new
system to maximize  their  visibility and  identification,  wherever they may be
placed in stores.




Customers

     Retail and specialty  chains,  and club stores  represented 52% of Hansen's
sales in the year ended December 31, 2001 and 56% in the year ended December 31,
2000,  while the  percentage of sales to  distributors  (primarily of Hansens(R)
Energy drinks,  Energade(R) energy sports drinks, Smoothies in glass bottles and
Signature  Sodas) in the year ended December 31, 2001, was 25%,  compared to 33%
in the previous year. Sales to health food distributors increased from 5% in the
year ended December 31, 2000 to 11% in the year ended December 31, 2001.

     Hansen's major customers in 2001 included Costco, Trader Joe's, Sam's Club,
Vons,  Ralph's,  Wal-Mart,  Safeway and Albertson's.  One customer accounted for
approximately  18%,  23% and 25% of the  Company's  sales  for the  years  ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  A decision by that or any other
major  customer to decrease  the amount  purchased  from the Company or to cease
carrying the  Company's  products  could have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's financial condition and consolidated results of operations.

Seasonality

     Hansen  normally  experiences  greater sales and  profitability  during its
second and third fiscal quarters (April through  September).  The consumption of
beverage  products  fluctuates  in part  due to  temperature  changes  with  the
greatest  consumption  occurring  during the warm  months.  During  months where
temperatures  are  abnormally  warm  or  cold,   consumption  goes  up  or  down
accordingly.   Similarly,   consumption  is  affected  in  those  regions  where
temperature  and other  weather  conditions  undergo  dramatic  changes with the
seasons.  Management  anticipates  that the sale of the  Company's  products may
become increasingly subject to seasonal fluctuations as more sales occur outside
of California in areas where weather  conditions are  intemperate.  Sales of the
Company's juice products,  Energy drinks,  children's multi-vitamin juice drinks
and Junior Juice drinks are likely to be less affected by such factors, although
school  calendars  do have an  impact on sales of the  children's  multi-vitamin
juice  drinks  and  Junior  Juice  drinks.  Similarly,  sales  of the  Company's
nutrition  food bars and cereals are likely to be less affected by such factors.
However, as the Company has not had sufficient experience with such products, it
is unable to predict the likely sales trend of such  products with any degree of
accuracy.

Trademark

     The  Hansen's(R)  trademark  is crucial  to the  Company's  business.  This
trademark is registered in the U.S.  Patent and Trademark  Office and in various
countries  throughout  the  world.  The  Hansen's(R)  trademark  is owned by the
Company  which  acquired it from a trust (the  "Trust")  which was created by an
agreement  between HBC and the  predecessor  company of Fresh  Juice  Company of
California  ("FJC") (the  "Agreement  of Trust").  The Trust  licensed to HBC in
perpetuity on an exclusive  world-wide  royalty-free  basis the right to use the
Hansen's(R) trademark in connection with the manufacture,  sale and distribution
of  carbonated  beverages  and waters and shelf  stable  fruit juices and drinks
containing fruit juices. In addition,  the Trust licensed to HBC, in perpetuity,
on an exclusive world-wide basis, the right to use the Hansen's(R)  trademark in
connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of certain non-carbonated
beverages and water in  consideration of royalty  payments.  There was a similar
license  agreement  between  the  Trust  and HBC  with  regard  to  non-beverage
products. No royalties were payable on sodas, Energy drinks, juices,  lemonades,
juice  cocktails,  fruit  juice  Smoothies,  the  Signature  Soda line or on the
children's multi-vitamin juice drinks. Royalty expenses of $12,000 were incurred
in 1999. As explained  below,  no royalty  expenses were incurred during 2001 or
2000.

     HBC, FJC's  predecessor  and the Trust also entered into a Royalty  Sharing
Agreement  pursuant to which royalties  payable by third parties procured by FJC
or its  predecessor  or HBC are initially  shared between the Trust and HBC and,
after a specified  amount of royalties  have been  received,  are shared equally
between HBC and FJC.  Under the terms of the  Agreement  of Trust,  FJC receives
royalty  income  paid to the  Trust in excess  of Trust  expenses  and a reserve
therefor.



     Effective  September 22, 1999, HBC entered into an Assignment and Agreement
with FJC pursuant to which HBC acquired  exclusive  ownership of the Hansen's(R)
trademark  and trade names.  Under the  Assignment  and  Agreement,  among other
matters,  HBC acquired all FJC's rights as grantor and beneficiary of the Trust,
all FJC's rights as licensee under certain license  agreement  pursuant to which
FJC has the right to manufacture, sell and distribute fresh juice products under
the  Hansen's(R)  trademark  and all  FJC's  rights  under the  Royalty  Sharing
Agreement  referred to above, as well as certain  additional rights, for a total
consideration  of  $775,010,  payable  over three  years.  FJC is  permitted  to
continue to  manufacture,  sell and  distribute  fresh juice  products under the
Hansen's(R) trademark for a period of five years. Consequently, HBC now has full
ownership of the  Hansen's(R)  trademark and its obligation to pay royalties to,
and to share royalties with, FJC has been terminated. As of December 31, 2001, a
balance of $143,750 was payable to FJC.

     The Company has  applied to register a number of  trademarks  in the United
States  including,  but not limited to, Hansen's  energy(TM),  Hansen's  Natural
Multi-Vitamin Juice Slam(TM),  Powerpack(TM), Hard e(TM), A New Kind a Buzz(TM),

whom are  employed  on a full-time  basis.  Of Hansen's  108  employees,  42 are
employed in administrative and quality control capacities and 66 are employed in

Compliance with Environmental Laws

     The operation of Hansen's business is not materially affected by compliance
with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations.  In California,
Hansen's is required to collect  deposits  from its  customers and to remit such
deposits to the State of California  Department of  Conservation  based upon the
number of cans and  bottles  of  certain of its  carbonated  and  non-carbonated
products sold. In certain other states and Canada where  Hansen(R)  products are
sold, the Company is also required to collect deposits from its customers and to
remit such  deposits  to the  respective  conservation  agencies  based upon the
number of cans and  bottles  of  certain of its  carbonated  and  non-carbonated
products, sold in such states.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     Hansen's  corporate  offices  and main  warehouse  are  located in a single
building at 1010 Railroad Street,  Corona,  California  92882.  This facility is
leased by HBC for a period of ten years  commencing  October 20, 2000. The gross
area of the facility is  approximately  113,600  square feet. The monthly rental
payments,  according to the terms of the lease,  are subject to increase  during
the third, sixth and eighth years. HBC also rents additional  warehouse space on
a short  term  basis  from  time to time as well as public  warehouses  situated
throughout the United States and Canada.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     During 2000, the Company commenced  arbitration  proceedings  against Sammy
Sosa before the  American  Arbitration  Association  in Orange  County,  for the
repayment  by Mr. Sosa to the  Company of the sum of $175,000  which was paid to
Mr. Sosa, by virtue of Mr. Sosa's failure to perform his obligations in terms of
his  agreement  with the  Company.  Mr. Sosa filed a counter  claim  against the
Company seeking damages  approximating  $2.8 million.  The claims by and against
the Company  were  settled in January 2002 on the basis that each of the parties
withdrew their respective claims against each other.

     Late in 2000, Rhonda Morris filed a complaint in the Superior Court for the
State of California,  County of San Francisco against the Company,  in which she
claimed  sexual  harassment by an employee of the Company in connection  with an
alleged denial of employment to her and in which she seeks unspecified  monetary
damages.  The Company  removed the complaint to the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California. In March 2002, the Company entered into
a  settlement  agreement  with  Morris  in terms of which the  Company,  without
admission of wrongdoing,  agreed to pay the sum of $60,000 in full settlement of
Morris' claim.

     In March 2001,  the  Company  filed a  complaint  in Federal  Court for the
Central  District  of  California  against  South  Beach  Beverage  Company  LLC
("Sobe"),  for  patent  infringement,   violation  of  trademark  rights,  false
advertising, unfair competition,  trespass to chattels and tortious interference
with business  relations  arising from Sobe's unlawful  conduct and unauthorized
use of the  Company's  property and the patent held by the Company in respect of
its  rolling  rack  shelf  structure,   Sobe's  improper   business   practices,
interference with the Company's right to conduct its business, injunctive relief
and unspecified monetary damages.

     The  Company  is subject  to, and  involved  in,  claims and  contingencies
related to lawsuits,  arbitration proceedings,  and other matters arising out of
the normal  course of business.  The  ultimate  liability  associated  with such



claims and contingencies, including those mentioned above, is not likely to have
a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.

     Except as described above,  there are no material pending legal proceedings
to which the  Company or any of its  subsidiaries  is a party or to which any of
the properties is subject, other than ordinary and routine litigation incidental

ITEM 7.           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

     During 2001, the Company continued to expand its existing product lines and
further develop its markets.  In particular,  the Company  continues to focus on
developing  and  marketing  beverages  that fall within the  category  generally
described as the  "functional"  beverage  category with  particular  emphasis on
Energy type drinks.

     The Company  achieved  record sales in 2001.  The increase in sales in 2001
was  primarily  attributable  to the  growth in sales of the  Company's  Natural
Sodas,  Blue Sky Natural Sodas and apple juice, as well as sales of Junior Juice
drinks since the  acquisition by the Company of that brand and  Energade(R)  and
E2O Energy  Water  since their  respective  introductions  during the year.  The
increase in sales was partially offset by decreased sales of Smoothies in P.E.T.
and glass  bottles,  and the  Healthy  Start/Silver  Foxes juice line as well as
lower sales of iced teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Signature Sodas and the
children's  multi  vitamin juice drinks in 8.45-ounce  aseptic  packaging.  As a
result of the change in the Company's product and customer mix, the gross profit
percentage  achieved  by the  Company in 2001  decreased  to 44.2% from 46.5% in
2000.

     During 2001,  sales outside of California  represented 39% of the aggregate
sales of the Company, as compared to approximately 37% of the aggregate sales of
the Company in 2000. Sales to distributors outside the United States during 2001
amounted to $1,233,000 compared to $753,000 in 2000.

     The Company introduced a line of diet Natural Sodas in 12-ounce cans at the
end of  2000/beginning  of 2001 and an  additional  flavor,  Ginger  Ale, to its
regular Natural Soda line in 2001. In addition,  the Company also introduced its
original Energy drink in 8.3-ounce glass bottles,  two additional  energy drinks
in 8.3-ounce  slim-cans,  Sparkling  Lemonades  and  Orangeades in 1-liter glass
bottles,  Medicine Man(R) in glass bottles,  Energade(R) in 23.5-ounce cans, E2O
Energy Water in 24-ounce P.E.T.  bottles,  Soy Smoothies in 1-liter and 11-ounce
aseptic  packaging,  additional juice blends in 64-ounce P.E.T.  bottles,  fruit
juice Smoothies in 16-ounce P.E.T. bottles, functional nutrition bars and active
nutrition bars. The Company reduced its Smoothie line in 64-ounce P.E.T. bottles
from six flavors to two flavors. The Company is discontinuing its entire Healthy
Start/Silver Foxes 100% juice lines in glass and P.E.T.  bottles.  Response from
customers and consumers to the Medicine  Man(R) line was  disappointing  and, in
consequence, the Company is presently reevaluating that line.



     Sales of the Company's dual-branded 100% juice line named "Juice Blast(R)",
which  was   launched   in   conjunction   with  Costco   under  the   "Kirkland
Signature(TM)/Hansen's(R)  Natural"  brand name and is sold  nationally  through
Costco stores, were slightly lower than in 2000. The Company has, in conjunction
with Costco,  introduced new flavors in place of certain of the existing flavors
and will  continue  to  introduce  new  flavors in an effort to ensure  that its
variety pack remains fresh and different for consumers.

     On September 20, 2000 the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Blue
Sky,  acquired  the Blue Sky Natural  Soda  business.  The Blue Sky Natural Soda
brand is the leading  natural  soda in the health  food  trade.  Blue Sky offers
natural sodas,  premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and
anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzers in 12-ounce cans.

     On May 25, 2001 the  Company,  through its wholly owned  subsidiary  Junior
Juice,  acquired the Junior Juice  beverage  business.  The Junior Juice product
line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages
and is targeted at toddlers.

     During 2001, the Company entered into several new  distribution  agreements
for the sale of its  products,  both within and outside  the United  States.  As
discussed under "ITEM 1 BUSINESS - MANUFACTURE, PRODUCTION and DISTRIBUTION", it
is anticipated that the Company will continue  building its national sales force
in 2002 to support and grow the sales of its products.

     Further,  during 2001,  the Company,  through its wholly owned  subsidiary,
HEB, continued to market a malt-based  beverage called Hard e, which contains up
to 5% alcohol. The Hard e product is not marketed under the Hansen's name.

     The  Company  continues  to  incur  expenditures  in  connection  with  the
development and introduction of new products and flavors.

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to the Year
Ended December 31, 2000

     Net  Sales.  For the year ended  December  31,  2001,  net sales were $92.3
million,  an increase of $12.6 million or 15.7% over the $79.7 million net sales
for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  The increase in net sales was  primarily
attributable to increased sales of natural sodas, Blue Sky Natural Sodas,  which
trademark  was acquired in September  2000,  and apple juice and sales of Junior
Juice,  which  trademark  was  acquired in May 2001 and  Energade(R),  which was
introduced in July 2001. To a lesser extent,  the increase in net sales was also
attributable  to the  introduction  of E2O Energy Water in June 2001,  increased
sales of Hard e, which was introduced in August 2000,  natural bars,  which were
introduced in August 2000,  smoothies in 11.5-ounce  cans and juice blends.  The
increase in net sales was partially offset by decreases in sales of smoothies in
glass and  P.E.T.  bottles,  Signature  Sodas,  children's  multi-vitamin  juice
drinks,  Healthy  Start/Silver  Foxes in glass  and  P.E.T.  bottles  and  teas,
lemonade and juice cocktails.

     Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $40.8  million for the year ended  December
31,  2001,  an increase of $3.7  million or 10.0% over the $37.1  million  gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2000. Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales decreased to 44.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 46.5% for the
year ended  December  31,  2000.  The  increase  in gross  profit was  primarily
attributable  to  increased  net  sales.  The  decrease  in  gross  profit  as a
percentage  of net sales is primarily  attributable  to slightly  lower  margins
achieved as a result of a change in the Company's product and customer mix.

     Total Operating  Expenses.  Total operating expenses were $35.3 million for
the year ended  December  31,  2001,  an increase of $5.1  million or 16.9% over
total operating expenses of $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.



Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 38.2% for the
year ended  December 31, 2001,  from 37.9% for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased
selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  The increase in total operating
expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase
in net sales and the  comparatively  larger  increase  in  selling,  general and
administrative expenses.

     Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  were $34.8 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2001 an increase of $5.0 million or 16.5% over selling,
general and administrative expenses of $29.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2000.  Selling,  general and administrative  expenses as a percentage of net
sales increased to 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 37.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2000.  Selling  expenses were $24.3 million for the year
ended  December  31,  2001,  an increase of $3.6  million or 17.1% over  selling
expenses of $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Selling expenses
as a percentage of net sales  increased to 26.4% for the year ended December 31,
2001 from 26.0% for the year ended  December 31,  2000.  The increase in selling
expenses  was  primarily  attributable  to increased  promotional  expenditures,
distribution  (freight) expenses,  commissions,  expenditures for graphic design
and premiums as well as fees paid for slotting. The increase in selling expenses
was partially offset by a decrease in expenditures for advertising,  merchandise
displays, point of sale and in-store demonstrations.  General and administrative
expenses were $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$1.4 million or 15% over general and administrative expenses of $9.0 million for
the year ended  December  31,  2000.  General and  administrative  expenses as a
percentage  of net sales was 11.3% for the year  ended  December  31,  2001 from
11.4% for the year  ended  December  31,  2000.  The  increase  in  general  and
administrative  expenses was attributable to an increase in payroll costs, which
was partially  offset by a decrease in other general and  administrative  costs.
The increase in payroll costs was partially attributable to noncash compensation
expense related to the exercise of stock options of $231,000.

     Amortization of trademark  license and trademarks was $507,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $136,000 over  amortization of trademark
license and  trademarks  of $371,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  The
increase in  amortization  of trademark  license and  trademarks  was  primarily
attributable to the amortization of the Blue Sky trademark for a full year since
the trademark was acquired in September  2000. To a lesser extent,  the increase
in amortization  of trademark  license and trademarks was due to the acquisition
of the Junior Juice trademark in May 2001.

     Operating  Income.  Operating  income was $5.6  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2001,  compared to $6.9  million for the year ended  December 31,
2000. The $1.3 million decrease in operating  income was primarily  attributable
to increased operating  expenses,  which was partially offset by increased gross
profit.

     Net Non-operating  Expense. Net non-operating  expense was $519,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2001,  which was $150,000 higher than net  non-operating
expense of $369,000  for the year ended  December 31,  2000.  Net  non-operating
expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest
and  financing  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2001 was  $528,000,  as
compared to $382,000  for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The  increase in
interest and  financing  expense was primarily  attributable  to the increase in
long-term debt, primarily related to the acquisition of the Blue Sky business in
2000. See also "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.  Interest income for the
year ended  December  31,  2001 was $9,000,  as  compared to interest  income of
$13,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  The decrease in interest  income
was primarily  attributable  to a reduction in the cash available for investment
during the year ended December 31, 2001.

     Provision for Income  Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2001 was $2.0 million as compared to provision  for income taxes of
$2.6  million for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The  effective  combined
federal and state tax rate for 2001 was 40.0% as compared to 40.1% for 2000. The
decrease  in the  provision  for  income  taxes was  primarily  attributable  to
decreased operating income.



     Net Income.  Net income was $3.0  million for the year ended  December  31,
2001,  compared  to $3.9  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The
$896,000  decrease in net income was attributable to decreased  operating income
of $1.3  million and  increased  non-operating  expense of  $150,000,  which was
partially offset by decreased provision for income taxes of $603,000.

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to the Year
Ended December 31, 1999

     Net  Sales.  For the year ended  December  31,  2000,  net sales were $79.7
million,  an increase of $7.4 million or 10.3% over the $72.3  million net sales
for the year ended  December 31, 1999.  The increase in net sales was  primarily
attributable  to increased  sales of the Company's  energy and other  functional
drinks  in  8.2-ounce  slim  cans  and  increased  sales  of the  Company's  new
children's  multi-vitamin  juice drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net
sales was also  attributable to increased sales of apple juice and Natural Sodas
and sales of Healthy  Start in glass  bottles as well as Blue Sky Natural  Sodas
since the  acquisition  by the  Company of that  brand in  September  2000.  The
increase in net sales was  partially  offset by decreases in sales of the Silver
Foxes juice line, Smoothies in cans, glass and P.E.T.  bottles,  Signature Sodas
and iced teas, lemonades and juice cocktails.

     Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $37.1  million for the year ended  December
31,  2000,  an increase of $3.6  million or 10.6% over the $33.5  million  gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 1999. Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales  increased  marginally to 46.5% for the year ended  December 31, 2000 from
46.4% for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The increase in gross profit was
primarily attributable to increased net sales. The increase in gross profit as a
percentage of net sales is primarily  attributable  to slightly  higher  margins
achieved as a result of a change in the Company's product mix.

     Total Operating  Expenses.  Total operating expenses were $30.2 million for
the year ended  December  31,  2000,  an increase of $4.2  million or 16.0% over
total operating  expenses of $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 37.9% for the
year ended  December 31, 2000,  from 36.0% for the year ended December 31, 1999.
The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased
selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  and was  partially  offset by a
decrease in other operating  expenses.  The increase in total operating expenses
as a percentage of net sales was primarily  attributable  to the increase in net
sales  and  the   comparatively   larger   increase  in  selling,   general  and
administrative expenses.

     Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  were $29.8 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2000 an increase of $4.5 million or 17.7% over selling,
general and administrative expenses of $25.3 million for the year ended December
31, 1999.  Selling,  general and administrative  expenses as a percentage of net
sales increased to 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 35.0% for the
year ended December 31, 1999.  Selling  expenses were $20.8 million for the year
ended  December  31,  2000,  an increase of $3.0  million or 16.7% over  selling
expenses of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Selling expenses
as a percentage of net sales  increased to 26.0% for the year ended December 31,
2000 from 24.6% for the year ended  December 31,  1999.  The increase in selling
expenses  was  primarily  attributable  to increased  promotional  expenditures,
distribution (freight) expenses, expenditures for merchandise displays and point
of sale  materials,  as well as fees paid for slotting.  The increase in selling
expenses  was  partially  offset by a  decrease  in  expenditures  for  in-store
demonstrations.  General and  administrative  expenses were $9.0 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2000, an increase of $1.5 million or 19.9% over general
and  administrative  expenses of $7.5  million for the year ended  December  31,
1999. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased
to 11.4% for the year  ended  December  31,  2000 from  10.4% for the year ended
December  31,  1999.  The  increase in general and  administrative  expenses was
primarily  attributable  to increased  payroll costs and certain other  expenses
incurred in connection with product  development  and expansion  activities into
additional states.

     Amortization of trademark  license and trademarks was $371,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $63,000 over  amortization  of trademark
license and  trademarks  of $308,000 for the year ended  December 31, 1999.  The
increase in  amortization  of trademark  license and  trademarks  was  primarily



attributable  to the  acquisition of the Blue Sky trademark,  which was acquired
during 2000 and is being amortized over a period of 40 years.

     No other  operating  expenses were incurred for the year ended December 31,
2000 as compared with $380,000 in other operating expenses incurred for the year
ended  December  31,  1999.  Other  operating  expenses  incurred  in 1999  were
primarily  attributable  to  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with a proposed
business combination that was not completed.

     Operating  Income.  Operating  income was $6.9  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2000,  compared to $7.5  million for the year ended  December 31,
1999. The $601,000  decrease in operating  income was primarily  attributable to
increased  operating  expenses,  which was partially  offset by increased  gross
profit.

     Net Non-operating  Expense. Net non-operating  expense was $369,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2000,  which was $317,000 higher than net  non-operating
expense of $52,000  for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  Net  non-operating
expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest
and  financing  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2000 was  $382,000,  as
compared to $171,000  for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The  increase in
interest and  financing  expense was primarily  attributable  to the increase in
long-term debt,  primarily  related to the acquisition of the Blue Sky business.
See also "Liquidity and Capital  Resources" below.  Interest income for the year
ended December 31, 2000 was $13,000,  as compared to interest income of $118,000
for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The  decrease in  interest  income was
primarily  attributable  to a reduction  in the cash  available  for  investment
during the year ended December 31, 2000.

     Provision for Income  Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2000 was $2.6 million as compared to provision  for income taxes of
$3.0  million for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The  effective  combined
federal and state tax rate for 2000 was 40.1% as compared to 39.9% for 1999. The
decrease  in the  provision  for  income  taxes was  primarily  attributable  to
decreased operating income.

     Net Income.  Net income was $3.9  million for the year ended  December  31,
2000,  compared  to $4.5  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The
$563,000  decrease in net income was attributable to decreased  operating income
of $601,000 and increased non-operating expense of $317,000, which was partially
offset by decreased provision for income taxes of $355,000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     As of December 31,  2001,  the Company had working  capital of  $12,978,000
compared to working capital of $13,644,000 as of December 31, 2000. The decrease
in working capital was primarily attributable to payments made on long-term debt
and increased  expenditures for the acquisition of property,  trademark  license
and  trademarks,  and  deposits  and other  assets.  The  decrease was offset by
working  capital  provided by net income  earned after  adjustments  for certain
non-cash expenses,  primarily  amortization of trademark license and trademarks,
depreciation and other  amortization,  the increase in deferred income taxes and
compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options.

     The Company's  cash was used for certain  working  capital  items,  such as
acquisition of increased  inventories and to reduce accounts payable, as well as
the acquisition of the Blue Sky and Junior Juice businesses,  trademark licenses
and  trademarks,  purchases  of  property  and  equipment.  The  acquisition  of
increased inventories,  increases in accounts receivable,  increases in deposits
and  other  assets,  acquisition  of  property  and  equipment,  acquisition  of
trademark licenses and trademarks, and repayment of the Company's line of credit
are expected to remain the Company's principal recurring use of cash and working
capital funds.

     Net cash used in investing  activities for the year ended December 31, 2001
was  $682,000,  as compared to net cash used in  investment  activities  of $7.9
million in 2000. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was



primarily attributable to lower levels of trademark  acquisitions,  purchases of
property and equipment and deposits and other assets in 2001.  Management,  from
time to time,  considers the  acquisition  of capital  equipment,  particularly,
merchandise  display racks,  vans and  promotional  vehicles,  coolers and other
promotional   equipment  and  businesses   compatible  with  the  image  of  the
Hansen's(R) brand, as well as the introduction of new product lines.

     Net cash used in financing  activities was $4.4 million for the year ending
December 31, 2001, as compared to net cash  provided by financing  activities of
$7.1 million in 2000.  The increase in net cash used in financing  activities as
compared to the prior year was  primarily  attributable  to increased  principal
payments of long-term debt, the reduction of short-term borrowings and decreased
proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2001. During 2000, the Company
purchased  common  stock  to be  held in  treasury,  whereas  no such  purchases
occurred in 2001.

     In 1997,  HBC  obtained a credit  facility  from  Comerica  Bank-California
("Comerica"),  consisting of a revolving line of credit of up to $3.0 million in
aggregate  at any  time  outstanding  and a  term  loan  of  $4.0  million.  The
utilization  of the revolving  line of credit by HBC was dependent  upon certain
levels of eligible  accounts  receivable and inventory  from time to time.  Such
revolving  line of credit and term loans were  secured by  substantially  all of
HBC's assets, including accounts receivable,  inventory,  trademarks,  trademark
licenses and certain  equipment.  That facility was  subsequently  modified from
time to time, and on September 19, 2000, HBC entered into modification agreement
with Comerica which amended certain provisions under the above facility in order
to finance the  acquisition  of the Blue Sky business,  repay the term loan, and
provide additional working capital ("Modification  Agreement").  Pursuant to the
Modification  Agreement,  the  revolving  line of credit was  increased to $12.0
million,  reducing to $6.0  million by September  2004.  The  revolving  line of
credit  remains in full force and effect  through  September  2005.  Interest on
borrowings  under the line of credit is based on bank's base (prime) rate,  plus
an  additional  percentage  of up to 0.5% or the LIBOR rate,  plus an additional
percentage of up to 2.5%,  depending upon certain  financial  ratios of HBC from
time to time.

     The following represents a summary of the Company's contractual obligations
and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2001:


     The  terms  of the  Company's  line of  credit  contain  certain  financial
covenants including certain financial ratios and annual net income requirements.
The line of credit contains  provisions  under which  applicable  interest rates
will be adjusted in increments  based on the  achievement  of certain  financial
ratios.  The Company was in compliance with the financial  covenants at December
31, 2001.

     If any event of default  shall occur for any reason,  whether  voluntary or
involuntary, Comercia may declare any or all of portions outstanding on the line
of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to
secured parties under the Uniform  Commercial Code,  institute legal proceedings
to foreclose upon the lien and security  interest granted or for the sale of any
or all collateral.

     Management  believes that cash  available from  operations,  including cash
resources and the revolving  line of credit,  will be sufficient for its working
capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials, payments of tax
liabilities,  debt  servicing,  expansion and  development  needs,  purchases of



shares of common  stock of the  Company,  as well as any  purchases  of  capital
assets or equipment through December 31, 2002.

European Monetary Union

     Within  Europe,  the  European  Economic  and  Monetary  Union (the  "EMU")
introduced a new currency,  the Euro, on January 1, 1999. The new currency is in
response to the EMU's policy of economic  convergence to harmonize trade policy,
eliminate  business costs  associated with currency  exchange and to promote the
free flow of capital, goods and services.

     On January 1, 2000, the  participating  countries adopted the Euro as their
local currency,  initially  available for currency trading on currency exchanges
and non-cash  transactions such as banking.  The existing local  currencies,  or
legacy currencies,  will remain legal tender through January 1, 2002.  Beginning
January  1,  2002,  Euro-denominated  bills  and  coins  will be used  for  cash
transactions.  For a period of up to six  months  from this  date,  both  legacy
currencies  and the Euro will be legal  tender.  On or before July 1, 2002,  the
participating  countries will withdraw all legacy currencies and exclusively use
the Euro.

     The  Company's  transactions  are recorded in U.S.  Dollars and the Company
does not currently  anticipate future  transactions  being recorded in the Euro.
Based on the lack of  transactions  recorded in the Euro,  the Company  does not
believe  that the Euro will have a material  effect on the  financial  position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Company. In addition, the Company has
not  incurred  and does not  expect  to incur  any  significant  costs  from the
continued  implementation of the Euro,  including any currency risk, which could
materially  affect the  Company's  business,  financial  condition or results of
operations.

     The Company has not experienced any significant  operational disruptions to
date and does not currently expect the continued  implementation  of the Euro to
cause any significant operational disruptions.

Critical Accounting Policies

     The  following  summarize  the most  significant  accounting  and reporting
policies and practices of the Company.

     Trademark  License  and  Trademarks  -  Trademark  license  represents  the
Company's  exclusive  world-wide  right  to use  the  Hansen's(R)  trademark  in
connection with the manufacture,  sale and distribution of carbonated  beverages
and waters,  shelf stable fruit juices and drinks  containing  fruit juices on a
royalty free basis and other non-carbonated beverages and water and non-beverage
products in  consideration of royalty  payments.  In September 1999, HBC entered
into an  Assignment  and Agreement  with the Fresh Juice Company of  California,
Inc.  ("FJC"),  pursuant  to  which  HBC  acquired  exclusive  ownership  of the
Hansen's(R)  trademark  and trade names and its  obligation  to pay royalties on
certain  product  lines fell away.  The  Company  also owns in its own right,  a
number  of other  trademarks  in the  United  States  as well as in a number  of
countries  around the world.  The Company  also owns the Blue Sky(R)  trademark,
which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice(R)  trademark,  which
was  acquired  in May 2001.  The Company  amortizes  its  trademark  license and
trademarks over 40 years. The Company's  adoption of SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and
Other  Intangible  Assets,  will affect the Company's  method of amortizing  its
trademark license and trademarks.

     Long-Lived Assets - The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition
of  long-lived  assets in  accordance  with  Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standard  ("SFAS") No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets
and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of. In accordance  with SFAS No. 121,
long-lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances
that  indicate that their  carrying  value may not be  recoverable.  The Company
periodically  reviews  the  carrying  value of  long-lived  assets to  determine
whether or not  impairment to such value has occurred.  As of December 31, 2001,
management  does not  believe  that the  Company's  long-lived  assets have been



impaired.  If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is considered impaired,
an impairment  charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying  value of
the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

     Advertising  and  Promotional   Allowances  -  The  Company   accounts  for
advertising  production  costs by expensing such production costs the first time
the related  advertising  takes  place.  In addition,  the Company  supports its
customers  with  promotional  allowances,  portion  of  which  is  utilized  for
marketing and indirect  advertising by them. In certain instances,  a portion of
the promotional  allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to
such customers,  promotion  requirements or expected use of the allowances,  are
estimated by the Company. If the level of sales,  promotion  requirements or use
of the allowances are different from such estimates,  the promotional allowances
could,  to the extent it is based on  estimates,  be  affected.  The adoption of
Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 01-9, as described  below,  will affect
the presentation of these advertising expenses and promotional allowances within
the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.


New Accounting Pronouncements

     On January 1, 2001,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS No.  133,  Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities,  as amended by SFAS No. 137 and
SFAS No. 138. SFAS No. 133  establishes  accounting and reporting  standards for
derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative  instruments  embedded in
other  contracts,  and for  hedging  activities.  It  requires  that the Company
recognize all derivative  instruments as either current or non-current assets or
liabilities  at fair  value.  The  adoption  of  SFAS  No.  133  did not  have a
significant  impact on the  financial  position,  results of  operations or cash
flows of the Company.

     During 2000 and 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board's ("FASB")
EITF addressed various issues related to the income statement  classification of
certain  promotional  payments,  including  consideration  from  a  vendor  to a
reseller or another party that purchases the vendor's  products.  EITF No. 01-9,
Accounting for Consideration  Given by a Vendor to a Customer or Reseller of the
Vendor's   Products,   was  issued  in  November   2001  and  codified   earlier
pronouncements.  The consensus  requires  certain sales  promotions and customer
allowances currently classified as selling,  general and administrative expenses
to be  classified  as a  reduction  of  net  sales.  The  Company  is  currently
evaluating  the impact of EITF No.  01-9 on its  financial  statements  and will
comply with its provisions beginning in the first quarter of 2002.

     In June 2001, the FASB approved SFAS No. 141,  Business  Combinations,  and
SFAS No. 142.  SFAS No. 141  prospectively  prohibits  the  pooling-of-interests
method of accounting for business  combinations  initiated  after June 30, 2001.
SFAS No. 142  eliminates  the  current  requirement  to  amortize  goodwill  and
indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  addresses the  amortization of intangible
assets  with a defined  life and the  impairment  testing  and  recognition  for
goodwill and  intangible  assets on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an
event  occurs or  circumstances  change  that  would  reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value. SFAS No. 142 will apply to goodwill and
intangible  assets  arising  from  transactions  completed  before and after the
effective  date of June 30, 2001.  The adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142
is  required  for the  Company on January 1, 2002.  The  adoption of SFAS 142 is
expected to reduce the trademark  amortization  expense currently  recognized by
the Company.

     In December  1999, the Securities  Exchange  Commission  staff issued Staff
Accounting   Bulletin  ("SAB")  No.  101,   Revenue   Recognition  in  Financial
Statements.  SAB No. 101  summarizes  certain of the  staff's  views in applying
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the United  States of America to
revenue  recognition  and  accounting  for  deferred  costs in the  consolidated
financial statements and is effective no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal
years  beginning  after  December  15,  1999.  Based  on the  Company's  revenue
recognition  policy,  there was no material  impact to the  Company's  financial
position and consolidated statements of income from the adoption of SAB No. 101.



     In  accordance  with EITF No. 00-10,  Accounting  for Shipping and Handling
Fees and Costs,  reimbursements  of freight charges are recorded in net sales in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December
31,  2001,  2000 and 1999,  freight-out  costs  amounted to $4.2  million,  $4.1
million,  and $3.8  million,  respectively,  and have been  recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the accompanying  consolidated statements
of income

     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible  long-lived assets and the associated
asset  retirement  costs.  SFAS No. 143 is effective  for  financial  statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company believes that
the  adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a material  impact on its results of
operations  or financial  position  and will adopt such  standards on January 1,
2003, as required.

     In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or  Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets,  which  supersedes  previous  guidance  on
financial  accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets and for  segments of a business to be disposed  of.  Adoption of SFAS No.
144 is required no later than the beginning of fiscal 2002.  Management does not
expect  the  adoption  of SFAS  No.  144 to  have a  significant  impact  on the
Company's  financial  position  or  results  of  operations.   However,   future
impairment  reviews  may result in charges  against  earnings  to write down the
value of long-lived assets.

Year 2000 Compliance

     Prior to  January  1, 2000,  the  Company  reviewed  the  readiness  of its
computer  systems and business  practices for handling  Year 2000 issues.  Since
entering the Year 2000, the Company has not experienced any major disruptions to
its business nor is it aware of any  significant  Year 2000 related  disruptions
impacting its customers and suppliers.

     Cost incurred to achieve Year 2000 readiness,  which include any contractor
costs to modify existing  systems and costs of internal  resources  dedicated to
achieving Year 2000 compliance, were changed to expense as incurred and were not
material in 2000.

Forward Looking Statements

     The Private Security  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a
safe harbor for forward looking  statements made by or on behalf of the Company.
The Company and its  representatives  may from time to time make written or oral
forward looking statements,  including  statements  contained in this report and
other  filings with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  and in reports to
shareholders  and  announcements.   Certain  statements  made  in  this  report,
including certain statements made in management's  discussion and analysis,  may
constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the
Securities Act 1933 as amended and Section 21.E of the  Securities  Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended)  regarding the  expectations  of management with respect to
revenues,  profitability,  adequacy of funds from  operations  and the Company's
existing  credit  facility,  among other things.  All  statements  which address
operating  performance,  events  or  developments  that  management  expects  or
anticipates will or may occur in the future including  statements related to new
products,  volume  growth,  revenues,  profitability,  adequacy  of  funds  from
operations,  and/or the Company's  existing credit facility,  earnings per share
growth,  statements  expressing  general optimism about future operating results
and  non-historical  information,  are  forward  looking  statements  within the
meaning of the Act.

     Management  cautions  that these  statements  are  qualified by their terms
and/or important  factors,  many of which are outside the control of the Company
that  could  cause  actual  results  and  events to differ  materially  from the
statements made including, but not limited to, the following:



o    Company's  ability to  generate  sufficient  cash flows  to support capital
     expansion  plans and  general operating activities;
o    Changes in consumer preferences;
o    Changes in demand that are weather related,  particular in areas outside of
     California;
o    Competitive  products and  pricing pressures  and the Company's ability  to
     gain  or maintain share of sales  in the marketplace as a result of actions
     by competitors;
o    The introduction of new products;
o    Laws and  regulations,  and/or  any changes therein,  including  changes in
     accounting  standards,  taxation requirements  (including tax rate changes,
     new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws as
     well as the  Federal Food Drug  and  Cosmetic Act,  the  Dietary Supplement
     Health and Education Act,  and regulations made thereunder or in connection
     therewith,  especially those that may affect the way in which the Company's
     products  are  marketed  as well as  laws and regulations  or rules made or
     enforced by the  Food and Drug Administration and/or the Bureau of Alcohol,
     Tobacco and Firearms and/or certain state regulatory agencies;
o    Changes  in the cost and availability  of raw materials  and the ability to
     maintain favorable supply arrangements and relationships and procure timely
     and/or adequate production of all or any of the Company's products;
o    The Company's ability to achieve earnings forecasts,  which may be based on
     projected  volumes and sales  of many  product types  and/or  new products,
     certain of which  are more  profitable than others  and in  respect of many
     which the Company's experience is limited.   There can be no assurance that
     the Company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales;
o    The Company's ability to penetrate new markets;
o    The marketing efforts  of distributors of the  Company's products,  most of
     which  distribute products  that are competitive  with the products  of the
     Company;
o    Unilateral decisions by distributors, grocery store chains, specialty chain
     stores, club stores,  mass merchandisers and other customers to discontinue
     carrying all or any of the Company's products that they are carrying at any
     time;
o    The  terms and/or  availability  of the Company's  credit facility  and the
     actions of its creditors;
o    The  effectiveness  of the Company's advertising, marketing and promotional
     programs;
o    Adverse  weather conditions,  which  could reduce demand  for the Company's
     products;
o    The  Company's ability  to make suitable arrangements for the co-packing of
     its Energy and  functional drinks  in  8.3-ounce  slim  cans,  Smoothies in
     11.5-ounce cans, E20 Energy Water, Energade and other products.

     The foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive.

Sales

     The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales
for the past five years.  Data from any one or more quarters is not  necessarily
indicative of annual results or continuing trends.

     Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means a
unit of  measurement  equal  to 192  U.S.  fluid  ounces  of  finished  beverage
(twenty-four  8-ounce  servings)  or  concentrate  sold that will yield 192 U.S.
fluid  ounces of finished  beverage.  Unit case volume of the Company  means the
number  of unit  cases (or unit  case  equivalents)  of  beverages  directly  or
indirectly sold by the Company.  Sales of food bars and cereals are expressed in
actual cases. A case of food bars and cereals is defined as follows:

A fruit and grain bar and functional nutrition bar case equals ninety 1.76-ounce
     bars.
A natural cereal case equals ten 13-ounce boxes measured by volume.
An active nutrition bar case equals thirty two 1.4 ounce bars.

     The Company's  quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that
are primarily  the result of increased  demand in the warmer months of the year.
It has been Hansen's  experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the
first and fourth  quarters of each fiscal year.  Because the primary  historical
market for  Hansen's  products is  California,  which has a year-long  temperate
climate, the effect of seasonal  fluctuations on quarterly results may have been



mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution
of Hansen's  products  expands  outside of  California.  The Company has not had
sufficient  experience with its food bars, cereal products and Hard e malt-based
products  and  consequently  has no knowledge of the trends which may occur with
such  products.  Quarterly  fluctuations  may also be affected by other  factors
including the  introduction  of new  products,  the opening of new markets where
temperature  fluctuations are more pronounced,  the addition of new bottlers and
distributors,  changes in the mix of the sales of its  finished  products,  soda
concentrates  and  food  products  and  increased  advertising  and  promotional
expenses. See also "ITEM 1. BUSINESS - SEASONALITY."

Inflation

     The Company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations for the periods presented.

ITEM 7a. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

     The  principal  market risks  (i.e.,  the risk of loss arising from adverse
changes  in market  rates and  prices)  to which the  Company  is exposed to are
fluctuations  in commodity  prices,  affecting  the cost of raw  materials,  and
changes  in  interest  rates on the  Company's  long term debt.  The  Company is
subject to market  risk with  respect  to the cost of  commodities  because  its
ability to recover  increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the
competitive environment in which it operates.

     At December  31,  2001,  the majority of the  Company's  debt  consisted of
variable rate debt. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates  during the year
based on the Company's  cash  requirements.  If average  interest  rates were to
increase one percent for the year ended December 31, 2001, the net impact on the
Company's pre-tax earnings would have been approximately $71,000.

officers)  who are not  contractually  entitled  to be  nominated  to  serve  as
directors,  annual  fees of $7,000  plus $500 for each  meeting  attended of the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof. Norman E. Epstein, Harold C. Taber,
Jr. and Mark S. Vidergauz earned  director's fees of $8,000 and Benjamin M. Polk
earned  director's  fees of $7,500 for the one-year  period  ended  December 31,
2001.

Employee Stock Option Plan

     The Company has a stock  option plan (the  "Plan")  that  provided  for the
grant of options to purchase up to  3,000,000  shares of the common stock of the
Company to certain key  employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries.  Options
granted  under the Plan may either be incentive  stock options  qualified  under
Section 422 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended or  non-qualified
options.  Such options are exercisable at fair market value on the date of grant
for a period of up to ten years.  Under the Plan,  shares subject to options may
be purchased for cash, for shares of common stock valued at fair market value on
the date of purchase or in  consideration  of the cancellation of options valued
at the  difference  between the exercise price thereof and the fair market value
of the common stock on the date of exercise.

     During 2001, the Company adopted the Hansen Natural  Corporation 2001 Stock
Option Plan ("2001 Option Plan"). The 2001 Option Plan provides for the grant of
options to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company to
certain key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options granted under
the 2001 Stock Option Plan may be incentive  stock  options under Section 422 of
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),  nonqualified stock options,
or stock appreciation rights.

     The Plan and the 2001  Option  Plan are  administered  by the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company,  comprised of directors  who
satisfy  the  "non-employee"  director  requirements  of Rule  16b-3  under  the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and the "outside director" provision of Section
162(m) of the Code.  Grants  under  the Plan and the 2001  Option  Plan are made
pursuant to  individual  agreements  between the Company and each  grantee  that
specifies the terms of the grant, including the exercise price, exercise period,
vesting and other terms thereof.

Outside Directors Stock Option Plan

     The Company has an option plan for its outside  directors  (the  "Directors
Plan") that  provides for the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of
100,000  shares of common  stock of the Company to  directors of the Company who
are not and have not been employed by or acted as consultants to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  or affiliates  and who are not and have not been nominated to
the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to a contractual arrangement.  On
the date of the annual meeting of stockholders at which an eligible  director is
initially  elected,  each  eligible  director  is entitled to receive a one-time
grant of an option to purchase  6,000 shares  (12,000  shares if the director is
serving on a committee of the Board) of the Company's  Common Stock  exercisable
at the closing  price for a share of common stock on the date of grant.  Options
become exercisable  one-third each on the first, second and third anniversary of
the date of grant;  provided,  however,  that options granted as of February 14,
1995 are  exercisable  66 2/3% on the date of  grant  and 100% on July 8,  1995;



provided further, that all options held by an eligible director become fully and
immediately exercisable upon a change in control of the Company. Options granted
under the Directors Plan that are not exercised generally expire ten years after
the date of grant.  Option grants may be made under the  Directors  Plan for ten
years from the effective  date of the Directors  Plan.  The Directors  Plan is a
"formula plan" so that a non-employee director's  participation in the Directors
Plan does not affect his status as a "disinterested  person" (as defined in Rule
16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Hansen Natural Corporation
Corona, California



We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Hansen Natural
Corporation and  subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the years ended  December 31, 2001,  2000,  and 1999.  Our audits also
included the financial  statement schedule listed in Item 14. These consolidated
financial  statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and this financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of Hansen Natural  Corporation  and
subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  2001  and  2000,  and the  results  of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and
1999 in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United
States of  America.  Also,  in our  opinion,  the  related  financial  statement
schedule,  when  considered  in  relation  to the basic  consolidated  financial
statements  taken as a whole,  presents  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
information set forth therein.

HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999

1.       ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization  - Hansen  Natural  Corporation  (the  "Company" or  "Hansen")  was
incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1990. The Company is a holding company and
carries  on  no  operating  business  except  through  its  direct  wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Hansen Beverage Company ("HBC") which was incorporated in Delaware
on June 8,  1992 and Hard e  Beverage  Company  ("HEB")  formerly  known as Hard
Energy  Company,  and  previously  known  as  CVI  Ventures,   Inc.,  which  was
incorporated  in Delaware on April 30, 1990.  HBC conducts the vast  majority of
the  Company's  operating  business  and  generates  substantially  all  of  the
Company's  operating  revenues.  During the third quarter of 2000,  the Company,
through HEB,  introduced a malt-based  drink called Hard e which  contains up to
five-percent  alcohol.  The Hard e product is not  marketed  under the  Hansen's
name.  References  herein to "Hansen" or the "Company" when used to describe the
operating  business of the Company are  references to the business of HBC unless
otherwise  indicated,  and  references  herein to HEB when used to describe  the
operating  business of HEB, are  references to the Hard e brand  business of HEB
unless otherwise indicated.

In addition, HBC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Blue Sky Natural Beverage
Co.  ("Blue  Sky"),  which was  incorporated  in Delaware on  September 8, 2000,
acquired  full  ownership of and operates the natural soda  business  previously
conducted by Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co., a New Mexico corporation  ("BSNBC"),
under the Blue Sky(R) trademark (Note 2).

During 2001,  HBC,  through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Hansen  Junior Juice
Company ("Junior Juice"),  which was incorporated on May 7, 2001,  acquired full
ownership  of the  Junior  Juice  trademark.  The  Junior  Juice  trademark  was
previously owned by Pasco Juices, Inc.

Nature of Operations - Hansen is engaged in the business of  marketing,  selling
and distributing so-called  "alternative" beverage category natural sodas, fruit
juices,  fruit juice and soy Smoothies,  Energy drinks,  Energade  energy sports
drinks, E2O energy water,  "functional  drinks",  non-carbonated  ready-to-drink
iced teas,  lemonades and juice cocktails,  sparkling  lemonades and orangeades,
children's  multi-vitamin  juice products and still water under the  Hansen's(R)
brand name,  as well as nutrition  bars and cereals  also under the  Hansen's(R)
brand name,  natural  sodas under the Blue Sky(R)  brand name,  juices under the
Junior  Juice(R)  brand name and malt based  drinks under the Hard e brand name,
primarily  in certain  Western  states,  as well as in other  states  and,  on a
limited basis, in other countries outside the United States.

Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Hansen and its wholly owned subsidiaries, HBC, HEB, Blue
Sky and  Junior  Juice  since  their  respective  dates  of  incorporation.  All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company  considers  certificates of deposit with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.

Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in,  first-out (FIFO)
cost or market value (net realizable value).

                                       F-8


Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
of  furniture,  office  equipment,  equipment  and  vehicles  is  based on their
estimated  useful  lives  (three  to ten  years)  and is  calculated  using  the
straight-line  method.  Amortization  of leasehold  improvements is based on the
lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is
calculated using the straight-line method.

Trademark  License and Trademarks - Trademark  license  represents the Company's
exclusive  world-wide right to use the Hansen's(R)  trademark in connection with
the manufacture, sale and distribution of carbonated beverages and waters, shelf
stable fruit juices and drinks  containing  fruit juices on a royalty free basis
and  other  non-carbonated  beverages  and water and  non-beverage  products  in
consideration  of royalty  payments.  In  September  1999,  HBC entered  into an
Assignment  and  Agreement  with the Fresh  Juice  Company of  California,  Inc.
("FJC"),  pursuant to which HBC acquired exclusive  ownership of the Hansen's(R)
trademark and trade names and its obligation to pay royalties on certain product
lines  fell away.  The  Company  also owns in its own  right,  a number of other
trademarks in the United  States as well as in a number of countries  around the
world.  The Company also owns the Blue Sky(R)  trademark,  which was acquired in
September  2000, and the Junior  Juice(R)  trademark,  which was acquired in May
2001 (Note 2). The Company  amortizes its trademark  license and trademarks over
40 years.  The  adoption  of SFAS No. 142, as  described  below,  is expected to
reduce the trademark amortization expense currently recognized by the Company.

Long-Lived  Assets - The Company  accounts for the impairment and disposition of
long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard
("SFAS") No. 121,  Accounting  for the  Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. In accordance with SFAS No. 121, long-lived
assets to be held are  reviewed  for  events or changes  in  circumstances  that
indicate  that  their  carrying  value  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  Company
periodically  reviews  the  carrying  value of  long-lived  assets to  determine
whether or not  impairment to such value has occurred.  As of December 31, 2001,
management  does not  believe  that the  Company's  long-lived  assets have been
impaired.

Revenue  Recognition  - The  Company  records  revenue  at the time the  related
products  are shipped.  Management  believes an adequate  provision  against net
sales has been made for estimated returns, allowances and cash discounts.

Freight Costs And  Reimbursement  Of Freight Costs - In accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 00-10,  Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees
and Costs,  reimbursements  of freight  charges are recorded in net sales in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000, and 1999,  freight-out costs amounted to $4.2 million, $4.1 million,
and $3.8 million,  respectively,  and have been recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Advertising  and Promotional  Allowances - The Company  accounts for advertising
production  costs by expensing such production  costs the first time the related
advertising takes place.  Advertising expenses included in selling,  general and
administrative  expenses amounted to $4.3 million, $5.6 million and $5.7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In addition,
the Company  supports its customers,  including  distributors,  with promotional
allowances,   a  portion  of  which  is  utilized  for  marketing  and  indirect
advertising by them.  Promotional  allowances  amounted to $12.2  million,  $8.3
million and $6.3 million for the years ended  December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999,
respectively.

The  Company  includes  its  promotional  allowances  in  selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses.  Effective the first quarter of 2002, the Company will
comply  with  the  provisions  of the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's
("FASB") EITF No. 01-9,  which  addresses  various  issues related to the income
statement   classification   of   certain   promotional   payments,    including
consideration  from a vendor to a reseller or another  party that  purchases the

                                      F-9


vendor's products.  EITF No. 01-9 Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor
to a Customer or a Reseller  of the  Vendor's  Products,  was issued in November
2001 and codified earlier pronouncements.

Net Income Per Common  Share - In  accordance  with SFAS No. 128,  Earnings  per
Share,  net income per common share,  on a basic and diluted basis, is presented
for all  periods.  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted net income
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted  average  number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding,  if dilutive. Weighted
average  common  equivalent  shares  include  stock options and purchases of the
Company's common stock, held in treasury, using the treasury stock method.

Concentration  Risk - Certain of the Company's  products utilize components (raw
materials  and/or  co-packing  services)  from a limited  number of  sources.  A
disruption  in the  supply of such  components  could  significantly  affect the
Company's  revenues  from  those  products,   as  alternative  sources  of  such
components  may not be available at  commercially  reasonable  rates or within a
reasonably short time period.  The Company continues to take steps on an ongoing
basis to secure the availability of alternative  sources for such components and
minimize the risk of any disruption in production.

One customer accounted for approximately 18%, 23% and 25% of the Company's sales
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  A decision
by that, or any other major customer,  to decrease the amount purchased from the
Company  or to cease  carrying  the  Company's  products  could  have a material
adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and consolidated  results of
operations.

Credit Risk - The Company sells its products nationally,  primarily to retailers
and beverage  distributors.  The Company performs ongoing credit  evaluations of
its customers and generally does not require  collateral.  The Company maintains
reserves for potential credit losses,  and  historically,  such losses have been
within management's expectations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value
of Financial  Instruments,  requires  management to disclose the estimated  fair
value of certain  assets and  liabilities  defined by SFAS No. 107 as  financial
instruments.  At December 31, 2001, management believes that the carrying amount
of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because
of the short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.  Long-term  debt bears
interest at a rate comparable to the prime rate; therefore,  management believes
the  carrying  amount  for the  outstanding  borrowings  at  December  31,  2001
approximates fair value.

Use of Estimates - The preparation of the consolidated  financial  statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements - On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by
SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires that the
Company  recognize all  derivative  instruments as either current or non-current
assets or liabilities at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a
significant  impact on the  financial  position,  results of  operations or cash
flows of the Company.

                                      F-10



During 2000 and 2001,  the EITF  addressed  various issues related to the income
statement   classification   of   certain   promotional   payments,    including
consideration  from a vendor to a reseller or another  party that  purchases the
vendor's products. EITF No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor
to a Customer or a Reseller  of the  Vendor's  Products,  was issued in November
2001 and codified earlier  pronouncements.  The consensus requires certain sales
promotions and customer allowances currently classified as selling,  general and
administrative  expenses  to be  classified  as a  reduction  of net sales.  The
Company is  currently  evaluating  the impact of EITF No. 01-9 on its  financial
statements and will comply with its provisions beginning in the first quarter of
2002.

In June 2001, the FASB approved SFAS No. 141,  Business  Combinations,  and SFAS
No.  142,  Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets.  SFAS No. 141  prospectively
prohibits  the  pooling  of  interests   method  of   accounting   for  business
combinations  initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 eliminates the current
requirement  to  amortize  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived   intangible  assets,
addresses  the  amortization  of  intangible  assets with a defined life and the
impairment  testing and  recognition  for goodwill and  intangible  assets on an
annual basis or on an interim basis if and event occurs or circumstances  change
that would reduce the fair value of a reporting  unit below its carrying  value.
SFAS  No.  142  will  apply to  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  arising  from
transactions completed before and after the effective date of June 30, 2001. The
adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 is required for the Company on January
1, 2002.  The  adoption  of SFAS No.  142 is  expected  to reduce the  trademark
amortization expense currently recognized by the Company.

In  December  1999,  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  staff  issued  Staff
Accounting   Bulletin  ("SAB")  No.  101,   Revenue   Recognition  in  Financial
Statements.  SAB No. 101  summarizes  certain of the  staff's  views in applying
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the United  States of America to
revenue  recognition  and  accounting  for  deferred  costs in the  consolidated
financial statements and is effective no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal
years  beginning  after  December  15,  1999.  Based  on the  Company's  revenue
recognition  policy,  there was no material  impact to the  Company's  financial
position and consolidated statements of income from the adoption of SAB No. 101.

In June 2001,  the FASB  issued SFAS No. 143,  Accounting  for Asset  Retirement
Obligations,  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible  long-lived assets and the associated
asset  retirement  costs.  SFAS No. 143 is effective  for  financial  statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company believes that
the  adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a material  impact on its results of
operations  or financial  position  and will adopt such  standards on January 1,
2003, as required.

In August 2001,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  which supersedes  previous guidance on financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and
for  segments  of a business  to be  disposed  of.  Adoption  of SFAS No. 144 is
required no later than the beginning of fiscal 2002.  Management does not expect
the  adoption  of SFAS No.  144 to have a  significant  impact on the  Company's
financial position or results of operations.  However, future impairment reviews
may result in charges  against  earnings  to write down the value of  long-lived
assets.

2.       ACQUISITIONS

On September 20, 2000, the Company acquired through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Blue Sky, the beverage  business of BSNBC,  including the Blue Sky(R) trademarks
and certain other assets for a purchase  price of $6.5 million.  The Blue Sky(R)
products  include a range of all-natural  carbonated sodas and seltzers that are
marketed  throughout  the United  States and in certain  international  markets,
principally  to the health food trade.  On May 25,  2001,  the Company  acquired
through its subsidiary Junior Juice, the Junior Juice beverage business of Pasco
Juices, Inc., including the Junior Juice(R) trademarks and assumption of certain

                                      F-11


liabilities for a purchase price of $946,677.  The Junior Juice(R)  products are
comprised of 100% juices targeted at toddlers.

The  acquisitions  have been  accounted  for as  purchases  in  accordance  with
Accounting  Principles  Board  ("APB")  Opinion No. 16,  Business  Combinations.
Accordingly,  the purchase prices,  inclusive of certain acquisition costs, were
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on a valuation of
their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.  The purchase price for
the  acquisition  of Blue Sky,  inclusive  of  certain  acquisition  costs,  was
financed  through the Company's credit facility (Note 5). The purchase price for
the  acquisition  of Junior Juice was financed by the issuance of a note payable
to Pasco  Juice,  Inc.,  payable over five years and the  assumption  of certain
liabilities (Note 5).

Trademarks  acquired are amortized on a straight-line  basis over 40 years.  The
operating  results  of Blue Sky and  Junior  Juice  have  been  included  in the
Company's results of operations since the respective dates of acquisition.

5.       LONG-TERM DEBT

In  1997,  HBC  obtained  a  credit   facility  from  Comerica   Bank-California
("Comerica"),  consisting of a revolving line of credit of up to $3.0 million in
aggregate  at any  time  outstanding  and a  term  loan  of  $4.0  million.  The
utilization  of the revolving  line of credit by HBC was dependent  upon certain
levels of eligible  accounts  receivable and inventory  from time to time.  Such
revolving  line of credit and term loans were  secured by  substantially  all of
HBC's assets, including accounts receivable,  inventory,  trademarks,  trademark
licenses and certain equipment.  On September 19, 2000, the Company entered into
a  modification  agreement with Comerica to amend certain  provisions  under the
above  facility in order to finance the  acquisition  of the Blue Sky  business,
repay the term loan,  and  provide  additional  working  capital  ("Modification
Agreement").  Pursuant to the  Modification  Agreement,  the  revolving  line of
credit was  increased  to $12.0  million,  reducing to $6.0 million by September
2004.  The  revolving  line of credit  remains in full force and effect  through
September 2005.  Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on the
bank's base (prime)  rate,  plus an  additional  percentage of up to 0.5% or the

                                      F-12


LIBOR rate, plus an additional  percentage of up to 2.5%, depending upon certain
financial ratios of the Company.

The initial  use of proceeds  under the  Modification  Agreement  was to pay the
seller in connection with the acquisition of the Blue Sky business, to repay the
remaining  $807,000  balance  due under the term loan and to provide  additional
working capital. The Company's  outstanding  borrowings on the line of credit at
December 31, 2001 were $5.0 million.

The credit facility  contains  financial  covenants which require the Company to
maintain  certain  financial ratios and achieve certain levels of annual income.
The facility  also contains  certain  non-financial  covenants.  At December 31,
2001, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company entered into capital leases
for acquisition of certain vehicles,  payable over a five-year period and having
an effective  interest rate of 8.8%.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000,  the assets
acquired under capital leases had a net book value of $402,387 and $519,688, net
of accumulated depreciation of $184,120 and $66,819, respectively.

Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31:

6.       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating  Leases - The Company  leases its  warehouse  facility  and  corporate
offices under a 10 year lease  beginning  October  2000,  when the Company first
occupied  the  facility.  The  facility  lease and certain  equipment  and other
non-cancelable  operating  leases expire  through 2010.  The facility  lease has
scheduled rent increases which are accounted for on a straight-line  basis. Rent
expense  under such leases  amounted to $644,454,  $416,505 and $391,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments at December 31, 2001 under the leases referred to
above are as follows:

Employment and Consulting  Agreements - On January 1, 1999, the Company  entered
into an  employment  agreement  with  Rodney C. Sacks and  Hilton H.  Schlosberg
pursuant to which Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg render services to the Company as
its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  and its Vice Chairman,  President and
Chief Financial Officer respectively.  The agreements provide for an annual base
salary of  $180,000  each,  increasing  by a minimum  of 8% for each  subsequent
twelve-month  period during the  employment  period,  plus an annual bonus in an
amount  determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company as
well as certain fringe  benefits for the period  commencing  January 1, 1999 and
ending December 31, 2003. After such date, such agreements provide for automatic
annual  renewals  unless written notice is delivered to each of them by June 30,
2003 or any subsequent June 30 thereafter.

Litigation  -  The  Company  is  subject  to,  and   involved  in,   claims  and
contingencies  related to lawsuits and other  matters  arising out of the normal
course of  business.  The  ultimate  liability  associated  with such claims and
contingencies,  if any, is not likely to have a material  adverse  effect on the
financial condition of the Company.

7.       INCOME TAXES

The  Company  accounts  for income  taxes under the  provision  of SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement requires the recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the future  consequences of events that have been
recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns.  Measurement of
the  deferred  items is based on  enacted  tax laws.  In the  event  the  future
consequences of differences  between financial  reporting bases and tax bases of
the Company's  assets and liabilities  result in a deferred tax asset,  SFAS No.
109  requires  an  evaluation  of the  probability  of being able to realize the
future  benefits  indicated by such asset.  A valuation  allowance  related to a
deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

8.       STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

The Company has three stock option plans,  the Hansen Natural  Corporation  2001
Stock Option Plan ("2001  Option  Plan"),  the Employee  Stock Option Plan ("the
Plan") and the Outside Directors Stock Option Plan ("Directors Plan").

During 2001,  the Company  adopted the 2001 Stock Option Plan which provides for
the grant of options to purchase up to  2,000,000  shares of the common stock of
the  Company to certain  key  employees  of the  Company  and its  subsidiaries.

                                      F-15



Options  granted under the 2001 Option Plan may be incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),  nonqualified
stock options,  or stock appreciation  rights.  Stock options are exercisable at
such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of  Directors  of the Company up to a ten-year  period after their date of
grant.  As of December 31,  2001,  options to purchase  37,000  shares of Hansen
common stock had been granted under the 2001 Option Plan and options to purchase
1,963,000  shares of Hansen  common stock remain  available  for grant under the
Plan.

The Plan, as amended,  provided for the granting of options to purchase not more
than 3,000,000 shares of Hansen common stock to key employees of the Company and
its  subsidiaries  through July 1, 2001.  Stock options are  exercisable at such
time and in such  amounts as  determined  by the  Compensation  Committee of the
Board of  Directors  of the Company up to a ten-year  period after their date of
grant,  and no options may be granted after July 1, 2001.  The option price will
not be less than the fair market value at the date of grant.  As of December 31,
2001,  options to  purchase  2,184,700  shares of Hansen  common  stock had been
granted under the Plan, net of options that have expired.

The  Directors  Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase up to 100,000
shares of common  stock of the Company to  directors  of the Company who are not
and have not been  employed  by or acted as  consultants  to the Company and its
subsidiaries  or affiliates  and who are not and have not been  nominated to the
Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to a contractual arrangement.  On the
date of the annual  meeting of  shareholders,  at which an eligible  director is
initially  elected,  each  eligible  director  is entitled to receive a one-time
grant of an option to purchase  6,000 shares  (12,000  shares if the director is
serving on a committee of the Board) of the Company's common stock,  exercisable
one-third each on the first,  second and third anniversary of the date of grant;
provided, however, that options granted as of February 14, 1995, are exercisable
66 2/3% on the date of grant and 100% on July 8, 1995; provided,  further,  that
all  options  held  by  an  eligible   director  become  fully  and  immediately
exercisable  upon a change in control of the Company.  Options granted under the
Directors Plan that are not exercised  generally expire ten years after the date
of grant.  Option grants may be made under the Directors Plan for ten years from
the effective date of the Directors Plan. The Directors Plan is a "formula" plan
so that a non-employee  director's  participation in the Directors Plan does not
affect his status as a  "disinterested  person"  (as defined in Rule 16b-3 under
the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934).  As of December  31,  2001,  options to
purchase  36,000  shares  of Hansen  common  stock  had been  granted  under the
Directors  Plan and options to purchase  64,000  shares of Hansen  common  stock
remained available for grant.

For the years ended  December  31, 2001,  2000,  and 1999,  the Company  granted
122,500,  189,000,  and 424,000  options to purchase  shares under the Plan, the
2001 Option Plan, and Directors Plan at a weighted average grant date fair value
of $1.36, $2.26, and $2.52,  respectively.  Additional information regarding the
plans is as follows:

                                      F-16




The  Company  has  adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of SFAS  No.  123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  SFAS No. 123 encourages,  but does not
require,   companies  to  record  compensation  cost  for  stock-based  employee
compensation  at fair value.  The Company has chosen to account for  stock-based
compensation  using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees,  and  related  interpretation.  Had
compensation  cost for the Company's  option plans been determined  based on the
fair  value  at the  grant  date for  awards  in the  years  1999  through  2001
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income and net
income  per  common  share  would  have been  reduced  to the pro forma  amounts
indicated below:

The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes   option-pricing   model  with  the   following   weighted-average
assumptions used:
