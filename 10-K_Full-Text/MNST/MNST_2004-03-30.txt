ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Overview

     Hansen Natural  Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1990.
Its principal place of business is at 1010 Railroad Street,  Corona,  California
92882 and its  telephone  number is (909)  739-6200.  When this  report uses the
words "Hansen",  "HBC", "the Company",  "we", "us", and "our", these words refer
to Hansen Natural  Corporation and our  subsidiaries  other than Hard e Beverage
Company ("HEB"), unless the context otherwise requires.

     We are a holding company and carry on no operating  business except through
our direct wholly owned subsidiaries,  Hansen Beverage Company ("HBC") which was
incorporated in Delaware on June 8, 1992, and HEB, formerly known as Hard Energy
Company,  and previously known as CVI Ventures,  Inc., which was incorporated in
Delaware on April 30, 1990.  HBC  generates  substantially  all of our operating
revenues.

Corporate History

     In the 1930's,  Hubert Hansen and his three sons started a business to sell
fresh  non-pasteurized  juices  in  Los  Angeles,   California.   This  business
eventually became Hansen's Juices,  Inc., which subsequently became known as The
Fresh Juice  Company of  California,  Inc.  ("FJC").  FJC  retained the right to
market and sell fresh  non-pasteurized  juices  under the Hansen  trademark.  In
1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen,  perceived a demand for
pasteurized  natural  juices and juice  blends that are shelf  stable and formed
Hansen Foods, Inc. ("HFI"). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include
Hansen's(R)  Natural Sodas.  California  Co-Packers  Corporation  (d/b/a/ Hansen
Beverage Company) ("CCC") acquired certain assets of HFI, including the right to
market the  Hansen's(R)  brand name,  in January  1990.  On July 27,  1992,  HBC
acquired the  Hansen's(R)  brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC.
Under our ownership, the Hansen beverage business has significantly expanded and
includes a wide range of  beverages  within the growing  "alternative"  beverage
category.  As will  appear  more fully  from the  section  headed  "Intellectual
Property"  below,  in  September  1999  we  acquired  all  of  FJC's  rights  to
manufacture,  sell and distribute fresh non-pasteurized juice products under the
Hansen's(R)  trademark  together with certain  additional  rights. In 2000, HBC,
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co. ("Blue Sky"),
which was  incorporated  in Delaware on September 8, 2000,  acquired the natural
soda  business  previously  conducted  by Blue Sky Natural  Beverage  Co., a New
Mexico  corporation  ("BSNBC"),  under the Blue Sky(R) trademark.  In 2001, HBC,
through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  Hansen  Junior  Juice  Company,  ("Junior
Juice"),  which was incorporated in Delaware on May 7, 2001, acquired the Junior
Juice business  previously  conducted by Pasco Juices,  Inc. ("Pasco") under the
Junior Juice(R) trademark.

Industry Overview

     The alternative  beverage category combines  non-carbonated  ready-to-drink
iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single serve juices,  ready-to-drink iced
coffees,  energy drinks,  sports drinks, soy drinks and single-serve still water
(flavored and  unflavored)  with "new age"  beverages,  including sodas that are
considered  natural,   sparkling  juices  and  flavored  sparkling  waters.  The
alternative  beverage  category is the fastest  growing  segment of the beverage
marketplace according to Beverage Marketing  Corporation.  Sales in 2003 for the
alternative beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $14.1
billion at wholesale,  representing a growth rate of approximately 5.9% over the
revised  estimated  wholesale  sales  in 2002 of  approximately  $13.3  billion.

Products

     We develop,  market,  sell and distribute  "alternative"  beverage category
natural sodas, fruit juices, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice
and soy smoothies,  "functional  drinks",  sparkling  lemonades and  orangeades,
non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails,  children's
multi-vitamin  juice drinks and  non-carbonated  lightly  flavored energy waters
under the  Hansen's(R)  brand name. We also market,  sell and distribute  energy
drinks under the Monster(TM)  brand name. In addition,  we market nutrition bars
and  cereals  under  the  Hansen's(R)  brand  name.  We also  market,  sell  and
distribute,  natural  sodas,  premium  natural sodas with  supplements,  organic
natural  sodas,  seltzer  waters and energy  drinks  under the Blue Sky(R) brand
name. Our fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under the Junior Juice(R) brand
name. Our malt-based drinks are marketed under the Hard e(R) brand name.

     Natural  Sodas.  Hansen's  natural  sodas have been a leading  natural soda
brand in  Southern  California  for the past 25  years.  In 2003,  according  to
Information Resources, Inc.'s Analyzer Reports for California, our natural sodas
recorded  the  highest  sales  among  comparable  carbonated  new  age  category
beverages  measured by unit volume in the California  market.  Our natural sodas
are available in thirteen regular flavors consisting of mandarin lime, key lime,
grapefruit,  raspberry,  creamy root beer,  vanilla cola,  cherry vanilla creme,
orange mango, kiwi strawberry,  tropical passion,  black cherry,  ginger ale and
tangerine.  In  early  2001,  we  introduced  a new  line  of diet  sodas  using
Splenda(R) sweetener as the primary sweetener. We initially introduced this line
in four flavors:  peach,  black cherry,  tangerine lime, and kiwi strawberry and
have since added two  additional  flavors,  ginger ale and creamy root beer. Our
natural sodas contain no preservatives,  sodium, caffeine or artificial coloring
and are made with high quality  natural  flavors,  citric acid and high fructose
corn syrup or, in the case of diet sodas, with Splenda(R) and  Acesulfame-K.  We
package our natural  sodas in 12-ounce  aluminum  cans. In 2002, we introduced a
line of natural  mixers in 8-ounce  aluminum cans  comprising  club soda,  tonic
water and ginger ale.

     In January 1999, we introduced a premium line of Signature  Sodas in unique
proprietary 14-ounce glass bottles. This line was marketed under the Hansen's(R)
brand name,  primarily through our distributor network, in six flavors. In early
2003 we  repositioned  this line into lower cost  12-ounce  glass  packaging and
intend to market our  repositioned  Signature  Soda line at lower  price  points
directly to our retail customers such as grocery chains, club stores,  specialty
retail  chains and mass  merchandisers  and to the health  food  sector  through
specialty and health food distributors  (collectively referred to as our "direct
retail  customers").  Signature  Soda is available in 12-ounce  glass bottles in
five flavors:  orange creme, vanilla creme, ginger beer,  sarsaparilla and black
cherry.

     In September  2000,  we acquired the Blue Sky Natural  Soda  business  from
BSNBC. Our Blue Sky product line comprises natural sodas, premium sodas, organic
natural sodas,  seltzer water and energy  drinks.  Blue Sky(R) natural sodas are
available in thirteen  regular  flavors  consisting  of lemon lime,  grapefruit,
cola, root beer, raspberry,  cherry vanilla creme, truly orange, Jamaican ginger
ale, black cherry,  orange creme,  Dr. Becker,  grape and private  reserve cream
soda. We also offer a Blue Sky(R)  product line of premium line of natural sodas
which contain supplements such as ginseng. This line is available in six flavors
consisting of ginseng creme, ginseng cola, ginseng root beer, ginseng very berry
creme,  ginseng ginger ale, and ginseng  cranberry-raspberry.  During 1999, Blue
Sky(R)  introduced a line of organic  natural sodas,  which are available in six
flavors consisting of prime lime cream, new century cola, orange divine,  ginger
gale, black cherry cherish,  and root beer. We also market a seltzer water under
the Blue Sky(R) label in three  flavors:  natural,  lime and lemon.  In 2002, we
introduced a lightly  carbonated  Blue Sky(R) energy drink in an 8.3-ounce  slim
can.  The Blue  Sky(R)  products  contain no  preservatives,  sodium or caffeine
(other  than the energy  drink) or  artificial  coloring  and are made with high
quality  natural  flavors.  Blue Sky(R)  natural  sodas and  seltzer  waters are
packaged in 12-ounce  aluminum  cans and are  marketed  primarily  to our direct
retail customers.



     In 2001, we introduced a new line of sparkling lemonades (regular and pink)
and orangeades in unique  proprietary  1-liter glass bottles and towards the end
of 2002, we  introduced  diet  versions of our regular  sparkling  lemonades and
orangeades,   also  in  1-liter  glass  bottles.  The  sparkling  lemonades  and
orangeades  contain  real juice and pulp.  In 2003,  we extended  this line into
unique  proprietary  12-ounce  glass bottles in both regular and diet  versions.
This product line is marketed to our direct retail customers.

     Hansen's Energy Drinks. In 1997, we introduced a lightly  carbonated citrus
flavored Hansen's(R) energy drink. Our energy drink competes in the "functional"
beverage category, namely, beverages that provide a real or perceived benefit in
addition to simply  delivering  refreshment.  We offer our energy drink in three
versions:  original  citrus,  tropical and wild berry. We also offer  additional
functional  drinks  including a ginger  flavored  d-stress(R)  drink,  an orange
flavored  b-well(TM)  drink, a guarana berry flavored  stamina(R) drink, a grape
flavor power drink,  and a  berry-flavored  "slim-down"  drink that  contains no
calories.   Each  of  our  energy  and  functional   drinks  contain   different
combinations   of  vitamins,   minerals,   nutrients,   herbs  and   supplements
("supplements").  Our energy drinks and functional  drinks are sold in 8.3-ounce
cans and bottles. In 2001, we introduced  Energade(R),  a non-carbonated  energy
sports  drink  in  23.5-ounce  cans  in two  flavors,  citrus  and  orange,  and
subsequently  introduced a third  flavor,  red rocker.  We also  introduced  E2O
Energy  Water(R),  a  non-carbonated  lightly  flavored  water, in 24-ounce blue
polyethylene   terephthalate   ("P.E.T.")  plastic  bottles,  in  four  flavors,
tangerine,  apple, berry and lemon. In 2002, we expanded our E2O Energy Water(R)
line with four additional flavors in clear P.E.T. plastic bottles,  mango melon,
kiwi  strawberry,  grapefruit  and green  tea.  Our  Energade(R)  and E2O Energy
Water(R) drinks also contain  different  combinations and levels of supplements.
At the end of 2002,  we  introduced  a lightly  carbonated  diet energy drink in
8.3-ounce  cans under the  Hansen's(R)  Diet Red brand name. Our Diet Red energy
drink is sweetened with Splenda and Acesulfame-K. We market our energy, Diet Red
energy,  Energade and E2O Energy  Water(R)  drinks in clear bottles  through our
full service  distributor  network.  We market our E2O Energy Water(R) drinks in
blue  bottles  to our  direct  retail  customers.  In 2003 we  introduced  a new
carbonated  energy drink under the  Hansen's(R)  Deuce brand name, in a 16-ounce
can, but with a different flavor than our existing  Hansen's(R) Energy drinks in
8.3-ounce cans.

     Monster  Energy(TM)  Drinks.  In 2002, we launched a new carbonated  energy
drink under the Monster Energy(TM) brand name, in 16-ounce cans, which is almost
double the size of our  regular  energy  drinks in  8.3-ounce  cans and the vast
majority of  competitive  energy  drinks  currently  on the market.  Our Monster
Energy(TM)  drink contains  different  types and levels of supplements  than our
Hansen's(R)  energy drinks and is marketed through our full service  distributor
network.  In 2003,  we  introduced a low carb version of our Monster  Energy(TM)
energy drink.

     Lost(R) Energy Drinks.  In 2004, we launched a new carbonated  energy drink
under the Lost(R) brand name, in 16-ounce  cans. The Lost(R) brand name is owned
by Lost  International LLC and the drinks are produced,  sold and distributed by
us under exclusive license from Lost International LLC.

     Juice  Products  and  Smoothies.  Our fruit  juice  product  line  includes
Hansen's(R)  Natural  Old  Fashioned  Apple  Juice which is packaged in 64-ounce
P.E.T. plastic bottles and 128-ounce  polypropylene  bottles and White Grape and
Purple Grape juices, and Apple Strawberry, Apple Grape and Apple Cranberry juice
blends,  in 64-ounce P.E.T.  plastic bottles.  These  Hansen's(R) juice products
contain 100% juice (except Apple  Cranberry which contains 27% juice) as well as
Vitamin C. Certain of these  products  also contain added  calcium.  Hansen's(R)
juice products compete in the shelf-stable juice category.  In 2002, we extended
our fruit juice and juice blend  product  line by  introducing  certain of these
products in 10-ounce  P.E.T.  plastic  bottles and in 2003 further  extended our
fruit juice product line by introducing a 100% Apple Juice in aseptic pouches in
a 6.75-ounce size.

     In March  1995,  we  introduced  a line of fruit juice  smoothie  drinks in
11.5-ounce aluminum cans. Certain flavors were subsequently offered in glass and
P.E.T.  plastic  bottles.  Hansen's fruit juice  smoothies have a smooth texture
that is thick  but  lighter  than a nectar.  Hansen's  smoothies  in  11.5-ounce
aluminum cans contain approximately 35% juice while the juice levels of Hansen's
smoothies in glass and P.E.T.  plastic bottles is 25%. Our fruit juice smoothies
provide 100% of the recommended daily intake for adults of Vitamins A, C & E and
represented Hansen's entry into what is commonly referred to as the "functional"
beverage  category.  Hansen's(R)  fruit  juice  smoothies  are  available  in 15
flavors:  strawberry  banana,  peach berry,  mango pineapple,  guava strawberry,
pineapple coconut,  apricot nectar, tropical passion,  whipped orange, cranberry
twist, a cranberry  raspberry lite as well as the blast line  comprising  Island
Blast, Colada Blast, Power Berry Blast, Vita Blast and Banana Blast.



     In 2001,  we  introduced  a new line of soy  smoothies  in 32- and 11-ounce
aseptic packaging in five flavors: berry splash,  tropical breeze, orange dream,
lemon chiffon and peach passion. The soy smoothies contain soy protein and fruit
juices.

     Sparkling  Apple Cider. In 2002, we introduced a Sparkling Cider 100% juice
drink in a  1.5-liter  Magnum  glass  bottle.  However,  due to  reports of some
bottles breaking we promptly voluntarily recalled the product. We are pursuing a
claim against the  third-party  bottler for the costs and losses incurred by us.
We will reevaluate  relaunching this product once certain  production issues are
resolved.

     We market  the above  juice and  smoothie  products  to our  direct  retail
customers.

     Iced  Teas,  Lemonades  and  Juice  Cocktails.  We  introduced  Hansen's(R)
ready-to-drink iced teas and lemonades in 1993. Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink iced
teas are available in three  flavors:  Original with Lemon,  Tropical  Peach and
Wildberry.  Lemonades  are  available  in one  flavor:  Original  Old  Fashioned
Lemonade.  Hansen's(R) juice cocktails were introduced in 1994 and are available
in three flavors: kiwi strawberry melon, tangerine pineapple with passion fruit,
and  California  paradise  punch.  We  introduced a variety 12 pack of iced teas
during  the  first  half of 2001,  which  experienced  limited  success.  We are
continuing  to  market  this  package.  Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink  iced  teas,
lemonades  and juice  cocktails  were  packaged  in  16-ounce  wide-mouth  glass
bottles.  At the end of 2002, we converted this line from 16-ounce glass bottles
to 16-ounce polypropylene bottles.

     Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink  iced  teas are made  with  decaffeinated  tea.
Hansen's(R)  juice  products and smoothies are made with high quality juices and
products  that  contain  less than 100% fruit  juice are also made with  natural
flavors, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid and other ingredients.

     In 1999, we introduced a line of specialty  teas in 20-ounce glass bottles,
which  we named  our  "Gold  Standard"  line.  We  subsequently  introduced  two
additional  green tea  flavors as well as two diet green  flavors  and six juice
cocktails.  We are  discontinuing  certain of the specialty  teas and all of the
juice cocktails but are continuing to market three regular green tea flavors and
the diet peach green tea flavor.  Our Gold Standard  line contains  supplements,
but at lower levels than in our  functional  drinks.  We continue to package our
Gold Standard Line in unique  20-ounce glass bottles.  Additionally,  in 2002 we
introduced  two of our iced tea  products,  namely green tea and  original  with
lemon in 10.14-ounce aseptic packages.

     Juices for Children.  In 1999,  we  introduced  two new lines of children's
multi-vitamin  juice drinks in 8.45-ounce aseptic packages.  Each drink contains
eleven  essential  vitamins  and six  essential  minerals.  Each  line has three
flavors.  We  introduce  new flavors in place of existing  flavors  from time to
time.  One of these two lines is a  dual-branded  100% juice  line named  "Juice
Blast(R)" that was launched in  conjunction  with Costco  Wholesale  Corporation
("Costco") and is sold  nationally  through Costco stores.  The other line was a
10% juice line named  "Hansen's  Natural  Multi-Vitamin  Juice Slam(R)" that was
available to all of our customers.  During 2000, we repositioned  that line as a
100% juice  line under the Juice  Slam(R)  name and are  marketing  that line to
grocery store chain customers,  the health food trade,  and other customers.  In
2002, we changed the size of the Juice Blast(R)  package to 6.75-ounces  and are
in the process of changing the size of the Juice Slam(R)  package to 6.75 ounces
as well.

     In May 2001, we acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business.  The Junior
Juice(R)  product line is comprised of seven flavors of 100% juice in 4.23-ounce
aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. Six flavors of the Junior Juice(R)
line have  calcium  added and all  flavors  have  vitamin C added.  The  current
flavors in the Junior Juice(R) line are apple, apple berry,  orange twist, apple
grape, mixed fruit, fruit punch, and white grape.



     Nutrition Bars and Cereals.  In 2000, we introduced a new line of nutrition
food bars under the  Hansen's(R)  brand name.  This line is made from grains and
fruit. In addition,  we introduced a new line of premium G.M.O.  free (free from
genetically modified organisms) cereals under the Hansen's(R) brand name. During
the first half of 2001, we introduced a line of functional food bars and towards
the end of the year  introduced  a line of  active  nutrition  bars,  which  are
specially formulated for adults who are older than 50 years of age. Sales of the
bars and cereals have been  disappointing  and we have discontinued all of these
lines other than the nutrition food bar line.

     Hard e Product Line.  In 2000,  we introduced a malt-based  drink under the
name Hard e, which contains up to  five-percent  alcohol.  The Hard e product is
not marketed  under the  Hansen's(R)  name.  Sales of this product line are very
limited.

     Bottled  Water.  Our still water  products were  introduced in 1993 and are
primarily sold in 0.5-liter plastic bottles to the food service trade.

  Other Products

     We  continue to  evaluate  and,  where  considered  appropriate,  introduce
additional  flavors and other types of  beverages  to  complement  our  existing
product  lines.  We  will  also  evaluate,  and  where  considered  appropriate,
introduce  functional   foods/snack  foods  that  utilize  similar  channels  of
distribution  and/or are  complementary to our existing products and/or to which
the Hansen's(R) brand name is able to add value.

Manufacture and Distribution

     We do not  directly  manufacture  our products  but instead  outsource  the
manufacture to third party bottlers and packers.

     We purchase concentrates,  juices, flavors, vitamins, minerals,  nutrients,
herbs,  supplements,  caps,  labels,  trays, boxes and other ingredients for our
beverage  products  which are delivered to our various third party  bottlers and
packers.  Depending  on the  product,  the third  party  bottlers or packers add
filtered  water and/or high  fructose corn syrup,  or sucrose,  or cane sugar or
Splenda brand sweetener,  Acesulfame-K  and/or citric acid or other  ingredients
and supplements for the manufacture and packaging of the finished  products into
approved containers.  In the case of sodas and other carbonated  beverages,  the
bottler/packer  adds  carbonation  to the  products  as part  of the  production
process.

     We are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase of and delivery
to our third party  bottlers and packers of the containers in which our beverage
products are packaged.

     The ingredients for our nutrition food bars are purchased by our co-packers
from various suppliers for manufacturing and packaging of the finished bars.

     All of our  beverage  products  are  manufactured  by various  third  party
bottlers  and packers  situated  throughout  the United  States and Canada under
separate   arrangements  with  each  of  such  parties.   The  majority  of  our
co-packaging arrangements are on a month-to-month basis. However, certain of our
material co-packing arrangements are described below:

     (a) Our agreement with Southwest Canning and Packaging,  Inc. ("Southwest")
pursuant to which Southwest packages a portion of our Hansen's(R) natural sodas.
This contract continues  indefinitely and is subject to termination upon 60 days
written notice from either party;

     (b) Our agreement with Nor-Cal Beverage Co., Inc.  ("Nor-Cal")  pursuant to
which Nor-Cal  packages a portion of our  Hansen's(R)  juices in P.E.T.  plastic
bottles. This contract continues until 2008 and is renewable annually thereafter
from year-to-year unless terminated by Hansen's not less than 60 days before the
end of the then current term.



     (c) Our agreement with Seven-Up/RC Bottling Company of Southern California,
Inc.  ("Seven-Up")  pursuant  to  which  Seven-Up  packages  a  portion  of  our
Monster(TM)  and Lost(R)  brand energy  drinks and a portion of our  Hansen's(R)
natural  sodas.  This  contract  continues  until  March  2008 and is  renewable
annually  thereafter.  Upon  termination  prior to such time we are  entitled to
recover  certain  equipment  we  have  purchased  and  installed  at  Seven-Up's
facility; and

     (d) Our agreement  with Tree Top, Inc.  ("Tree Top") pursuant to which Tree
Top packages a portion of our Hansen's  juices in P.E.T.  plastic  bottles.  The
Tree Top  agreement is for a period of one (1) year and is renewable  thereafter
from  year-to-year for additional one (1) year terms unless terminated by either
party.  Either party is entitled,  at any time,  to terminate  the  agreement on
60 day's written notice.

     Hard e malt-based drinks are manufactured for HEB by Reflo, Inc. ("Reflo"),
pursuant to a manufacturing  and  distribution  agreement  ("Reflo  Agreement").
Either party may elect to terminate  the Reflo  Agreement at any time on 90 days
notice. Reflo administers the sales and distribution of such products throughout
the United States under the terms of the Reflo  Agreement,,  excluding  Arizona,
California,  Nevada and Oregon where HEB is itself responsible for the sales and
distribution of such products.  Hard e is currently  distributed in five states.
However, in many of such states, distribution is on a limited scale.

     In many  instances,  equipment  is  purchased  by us and  installed  at the
facilities of our packers to enable them to produce certain of our products.  In
general,  such  equipment  remains our property and is to be returned to us upon
termination of the packing arrangements with such packers or is amortized over a
pre-determined  number  of  cases  that  are to be  produced  at the  facilities
concerned.

     We pack certain  products  outside of the West Coast region to enable us to
produce  products  closer to the markets where they are sold and thereby  reduce
freight costs. As volumes in markets outside of California  grow, we continue to
secure additional packing  arrangements closer to such markets to further reduce
freight costs.

     Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise,  particularly
with new  products,  and may be less  precise  during  periods of rapid  growth,
particularly  in new  markets.  If we  materially  underestimate  demand for our
products  or are  unable  to  secure  sufficient  ingredients  or raw  materials
including,  but not limited to, glass,  P.E.T./plastic  bottles,  cans,  labels,
flavors or supplement ingredients or certain sweetners, or packing arrangements,
we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis.

     Although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are
terminable  upon  request,  we  believe a short  disruption  or delay  would not
significantly  affect our revenues since alternative  packing  facilities in the
United  States with  adequate  capacity  can usually be obtained for many of our
products at commercially reasonable rates and/or, within a reasonably short time
period.  However, there are limited packing facilities in the United States with
adequate  capacity  and/or  suitable  equipment for many of our newer  products,
including  our energy  drinks and  functional  drinks in 8.3-ounce  and 16-ounce
cans, Gold Standard line, aseptic juice products,  Energade(R),  sparkling apple
cider in 1.5-liter  magnum glass bottles,  soy smoothies,  MonsterTM and Lost(R)
energy  drinks in 16-ounce cans and  sparkling  lemonades  and orangeade  lines.
There are also limited shrink sleeve labeling facilities  available to us in the
United States with adequate  capacity for our E2O Energy Water(R).  A disruption
or delay in production of any of such products  could  significantly  affect our
revenues from such products as alternative  co-packing  facilities in the United
States with adequate  capacity may not be available for such products  either at
commercially  reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if
at all. In  addition,  with  regard to the Hard e product,  while there are many
co-packing  facilities in the United  States with  adequate  capacity that could
produce such product,  due to regulatory  issues it may not be feasible for such
product  to be packed  at  alternative  packaging  facilities  on short  notice.
Consequently,  a disruption  in  production  of such  products  could affect our
revenues.   We  continue  to  seek  alternative  and/or  additional   co-packing
facilities  in the  United  States  or Canada  with  adequate  capacity  for the
production  of our various  products to minimize the risk of any  disruption  in
production.



     We have entered  into  distribution  agreements  for  distribution  in most
states of Hansen's(R) energy drinks,  Monster Energy(TM) drinks,  Lost(R) energy
drinks, Diet Red energy drinks,  Energade(R) energy sports drinks and E2O Energy
Water(R).  In many  states  however,  distribution  is only on a limited  scale.
Certain of our products are sold in Canada.  We also sell a limited range of our
products to  distributors  outside of the United  States,  including  the United
Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Guam, the Caribbean, the United Arab Emirates and India.

     We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into
agreements  with regional  bottlers or other direct store delivery  distributors
having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.  Many of our
bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture  and/or distribute
other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many cases,
such products compete directly with our products.

     We continue to take steps to reduce our inventory  levels in an endeavor to
lower our warehouse and distribution costs.

     During 2003, we continued to expand  distribution  of our natural sodas and
smoothies outside of California. We expanded our national sales force to support
and grow sales, primarily of Hansen's(R) energy drinks, Monster EnergyTM drinks,
Diet Red energy drinks, Energade(R) energy sports drinks and E2O Energy Water(R)
and we intend to continue to build such sales force in 2004.

     Our Blue  Sky(R)  products  are sold  primarily  to the health  food trade,
natural food chains and  mainstream  grocery  store  chains,  through  specialty
health food distributors.

     We have been  awarded  an  exclusive  contract  by the State of  California
("State")  Department of Health  Services,  Women,  Infant and Children  ("WIC")
Supplemental  Nutrition Branch ("DHS") to supply 100% apple juice and 100% apple
grape juice, in 64-ounce P.E.T. plastic bottles. The contract is for a period of
three  years with a further  one-year  extension  option to be  mutually  agreed
between  Hansen's  and the State of  California.  We bid the lowest net cost per
unit in terms of the wholesale price, less a rebate to the State.

     We expect to sign formal  written  agreements  with the State in accordance
with the bid process in due course.  Delivery of the first products to the trade
is expected to begin in advance of the July 12, 2004  commencement  date for the
contract.

     At the present time,  multiple  manufacturers are supplying apple juice for
the WIC program.  The new award makes Hansen's the exclusive  supplier.  We will
also be the exclusive  supplier for the blended fruit juice category,  a new WIC
category,  with our 100% Apple  Grape  Juice.  The WIC  contract  is expected to
expand the distribution of Hansen's juices,  resulting in increased exposure for
the Hansen's brand.  WIC-approved  items are stocked by the grocery trade and by
WIC-only stores.  Products are purchased by WIC consumers with vouchers given by
the DHS to qualified  participants.  The DHS  estimates  that  Hansen's  will be
supplying  24.5  million  units per year of 64 oz.  apple  juice and 5.4 million
units per year of 64 oz.  apple grape juice  pursuant  to this  contract.  These
estimates from the State, which we cannot independently verify or confirm, could
result in an  increase in net sales for the company of more than $20 million per
annum.  However,  juices sold pursuant to this contract will be at lower margins
than those of the Company's traditional juice business.



     Langer Juice Company  ("Langer") filed a protest against the DHS's award of
the  blended  fruit  juice  category to the Company and Tree Top filed a protest
against the DHS's award of the shelf stable  ready-to-drink apple juice category
to the Company.  During February 2004 the hearing officer duly designated by the
DHS dismissed  both the Langer and Tree Top protests.  In March Tree Top filed a
petition  for a writ of mandate  directing  the DHS to set aside their  decision
awarding the apple juice  contract to Hansen and to issue that award to Tree Top
or alternatively to require that the State rebid the apple juice contract.  Such
petition is presently pending.

     Our principal  warehouse  and  distribution  center and  corporate  offices
relocated to our current  facility in October 2000. In January 2004 we leased an
additional warehouse facility in Corona to consolidate additional space that had
been leased by us on short term  leases from time to time to meet our  increased
warehousing  needs due to  increases  in both sales  volumes  and  products  and
terminated  the two short term  leases  concerned.  We continue to take steps to
reduce our  inventory  levels  wherever  possible,  in an  endeavor to lower our
warehouse and distribution costs. See also "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES."

Raw Materials and Suppliers

     The  principal  raw  materials  used by us comprise  aluminum  cans,  glass
bottles and P.E.T.  plastic bottles as well as juices, high fructose corn syrup,
sucrose and sucralose,  the costs of which are subject to  fluctuations.  Due to
the consolidations that have taken place in the glass industry over the past few
years,  the prices of glass bottles  continue to increase.  The price of plastic
bottles and  aluminum  cans is  expected  to  increase in the future.  This will
continue to exert pressure on our gross margins.

     Generally,  raw  materials  utilized  by us in  our  business  are  readily
available from numerous sources. However, certain raw materials are manufactured
by only one  company.  Sucralose,  which is used  alone or in  combination  with
Acesulfame-K in the Company's  low-calorie  products,  is purchased by us from a
single manufacturer.  Cans for our energy and functional drinks (8.3 ounces) are
only manufactured by one company in the United States.

     With  regard to fruit  juice and  juice-drink  products,  the  industry  is
subject to the  variability  of weather  conditions,  which may result in higher
prices and/or lower consumer demand for juices.

     We  purchase   beverage   flavors,   concentrates,   juices,   supplements,
high-fructose corn syrup, cane sugar, sucrose, sucralose and other sweeteners as
well as nutrition food bars and other  ingredients,  from independent  suppliers
located in the  United  States  and  abroad,  and  cereals  from an  independent
supplier located abroad.

     Generally,  flavor suppliers hold the proprietary  rights to their flavors.
Consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors
and certain of our concentrates  readily available to us and we may be unable to
obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice.
We have identified alternative suppliers of many of the supplements contained in
many of our beverages.  However,  industry-wide shortages of certain fruits, and
fruit juices,  and supplements and sweeteners have been and could,  from time to
time in the future,  be  experienced,  which could  interfere  with and/or delay
production of certain of our products.

     We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of
our  flavors  and  concentrates  from  other  suppliers  as well as to  conclude
arrangements  with  suppliers  which would enable us to obtain access to certain
concentrates  or  product  formulae  in  certain  circumstances.  We  have  been
partially  successful in these endeavors.  Additionally,  in a limited number of
cases,  contractual  restrictions  and/or  the  necessity  to obtain  regulatory
approvals  and  licenses  may limit our  ability to enter into  agreements  with
alternative suppliers and manufacturers and/or distributors.

     In connection with the development of new products and flavors, independent
suppliers  bear a large portion of the expense of product  development,  thereby
enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively  low cost. We have
historically developed and successfully  introduced new products and flavors and
packaging  for our products and intend to continue  developing  and  introducing
additional new beverages and flavors.



Competition

     The  beverage  industry  is  highly  competitive.  The  principal  areas of
competition are pricing, packaging,  development of new products and flavors and
marketing  campaigns.  Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced
by a relatively large number of manufacturers,  most of which have substantially
greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.

     Important  factors  affecting our ability to compete  successfully  include
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective
development  of new,  unique  cutting edge  products,  attractive  and different
packaging,  branded  product  advertising  and  pricing.  We  also  compete  for
distributors  who will  concentrate  on marketing our products over those of our
competitors,  provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf
space in retail outlets.  Competitive  pressures in the alternative,  energy and
functional beverage categories as well as in the cereal,  nutrition food bar and
flavored malt beverage  categories could cause our products to be unable to gain
or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion, which could have a
material adverse affect on our business and results.

     Over the past three years we have experienced  substantial competition from
new entrants in the energy drink category.  A number of companies who market and
distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in larger volume packages,  such as 16-
and 20-ounce glass bottles,  including Sobe, Snapple Elements and Arizona,  have
added  supplements to their products with a view to marketing  their products as
"functional" or "energy" beverages or as having functional benefits.  We believe
that many of those products  contain lower levels of supplements and principally
deliver  refreshment.  In addition,  many  competitive  products are  positioned
differently  than our  energy  or  functional  drinks.  Our  smoothies  and Gold
Standard lines are positioned more closely against those products.

     We compete not only for consumer acceptance, but also for maximum marketing
efforts by multi-brand  licensed  bottlers,  brokers and  distributors,  many of
which have a principal  affiliation  with  competing  companies and brands.  Our
products  compete with all liquid  refreshments and with products of much larger
and  substantially  better  financed  competitors,  including  the  products  of
numerous  nationally and  internationally  known producers such as The Coca Cola
Company, PepsiCo, Inc., Cadbury Schwepps, which includes Dr. Pepper/Seven-up, RC
Cola, Snapple,  Mistic and Stewart's brands,  Nestle Beverage Company,  Anheuser
Busch and Ocean  Spray.  More  specifically,  our  products  compete  with other
alternative beverages,  including new age beverages, such as Snapple,  Elements,
Mistic,  Arizona,  Clearly  Canadian,  Sobe,  Stewart's,   Everfresh,  Nantucket
Nectars,  Vitamin Water,  Fuse,  VeryFine,  V8 Splash and Smoothies,  Calistoga,
Propel Fitness Water,  AquaFina,  Dasani, Reebok, and Crystal Geyser brands. Due
to the  rapid  growth  of  the  alternative  beverage  segment  of the  beverage
marketplace,  certain large companies such as The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo,
Inc. have introduced products in that market segment which compete directly with
our  products  such as Nestea,  Fruitopia,  Lipton,  Propel,  AquaFina,  Dasani,
Adrenaline Rush, Amp, KMX and Dole. Our products also compete with private label
brands such as those carried by grocery store chains and club stores.

     Our fruit juice smoothies  compete directly with Kern's,  Jumex,  Jugos del
Valle and Libby's  nectars,  V8  Smoothies,  as well as with single  serve juice
products produced by many competitors. Such competitive products are packaged in
glass and P.E.T.  bottles ranging from 8- to 48-ounces in size and in 11.5-ounce
aluminum cans. The juice content of such competitive  products ranges from 1% to
100%.

     Our apple and other juice products  compete directly with Tree Top, Mott's,
Martinelli's,  Welch's, Ocean Spray, Tropicana,  Minute Maid, Langers, Apple and
Eve,  Seneca,  Northland  and also with  other  brands of apple  juice and juice
blends, especially store brands.

     Our energy  drinks,  including  Hansen's(R)  energy,  Diet Red,  Hansens(R)
energy Deuce,  Monster  Energy(TM) and Lost(R) energy in 8.3- and 16-ounce cans,
compete directly with Red Bull,  Adrenaline Rush, Amp, 180, KMX, Venom,  Extreme
Energy Shot, Rockstar, No Fear, US energy, Red Devil,  Lipovitan,  MET-Rx, Hype,
XTC, and many other brands and our other functional drinks compete directly with
Elix, Lipovitan, MET-Rx, Think, and other brands.



     Our E2O Energy  Water(R) and still water  products  compete  directly  with
Vitamin Water, Reebok,  Propel, Dasani,  Aquafina,  Evian, Crystal Geyser, Naya,
Palomar Mountain,  Sahara,  Arrowhead,  Dannon,  and other brands of still water
especially store brands.

     The nutrition food bar and cereal categories as well as flavored malt-based
drink categories are also highly competitive. Principal areas of competition are
pricing,  packaging,  development  of new  products  and flavors  and  marketing
campaigns.  Our nutrition  food bars compete with products of other  independent
bar  companies  such as Power Bar,  Balance  Bar,  Gatorade,  Kashi,  Cliff Bar,
MET-Rx, and numerous other bars.

     Our Hard e product competes  directly with wine coolers,  such as Seagram's
and Bartles and James and  flavored  low alcohol  beverages  such as Mike's Hard
Lemonade,  Hooper's Hooch, Doc Otis Hard Lemonade,  Smirnoff Ice, Skyy Blue/Blue
Skyy,  Zima and Rick's Spiked Lemonade and other flavored malt and alcohol based
drinks.  Many of these products are produced by large national and international
manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and
distribution  resources than Hansen.  Such  companies  include  Anheuser  Busch,
Miller Brewing Company, Coors, Gallo Winery, and Diageo plc.

Sales and Marketing

     We focus on consumers  who seek  products  that are perceived to be natural
and  healthy  and  emphasize  the  natural   ingredients   and  the  absence  of
preservatives,  sodium, artificial coloring and caffeine in our beverages (other
than our energy drinks) and the addition to most of our products, of one or more
supplements.  We reinforce this message in our product packaging.  Our marketing
strategy  with  respect to our  nutrition  food bars and cereals is similarly to
focus on consumers  who seek bars and cereals  that are  perceived to be natural
and  healthy.   We  emphasize  the  natural   ingredients  and  the  absence  of
preservatives  and,  in the case of the  cereals,  the fact that they are G.M.O.
free.  Our marketing  strategy with respect to our Hard e product is to focus on
adult  consumers  who  seek an  alcohol-based  beverage  that  is good  tasting,
fashionable and meets consumers' needs.

     Our sales and  marketing  strategy  is to focus our  efforts on  developing
brand  awareness  and trial  through  sampling  both in stores  and at events in
respect of all our beverage,  food and alcoholic beverage  products.  We use our
branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events at which we distribute
our  products to  consumers  for  sampling.  We utilize  "push-pull"  methods to
achieve  maximum shelf and display  space  exposure in sales outlets and maximum
demand  from  consumers  for  our  products  including  advertising,   in  store
promotions and in store  placement of point of sale  materials and racks,  prize
promotions,  price promotions,  competitions,  endorsements from selected public
and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes
such as breast cancer  research as well as extreme  sports  figures and sporting
events such as the Hansen's Energy Pro Pipeline Surfing competition,  marathons,
10k runs,  bicycle  races,  volleyball  tournaments  and other health and sports
related activities, including extreme sports, particularly supercross, freestyle
motor cross, surfing,  skateboarding,  wakeboarding,  skiing, snowboarding, BMX,
Mountain  Biking,  snowmobile  racing,  etc.  and also  participate  in  product
demonstrations, food tasting and other related events. Posters, print, radio and
television  advertising together with price promotions and coupons are also used
to promote the Hansen's(R) brand.

     Additionally,   during  2003  we  entered  into  a  multi-year  sponsorship
agreement to advertise on the new Las Vegas Monorail ("Monorail Agreement") with
the Las Vegas  Monorail  Company  ("LVMC")  which includes the right to vend our
Monster  Energy(TM) drinks and natural sodas on all stations.  It is anticipated
that the initial term of the Monorail  Agreement  will commence in May 2004. The
initial  term of the Monorail  Agreement  ends on the first  anniversary  of its
commencement  date.  Not less than 120 days before the expiration of the initial
term and each renewal  term,  as the case may be, We have the right to renew the
Monorail  Agreement  for a  further  one  year  term  up to a  maximum  of  nine
additional  one year terms and the LVMC has the  right,  not  withstanding  such
election by us, to terminate  the Monorail  Agreement at the  expiration  of the
then current term.



     We  believe  that one of the keys to success in the  beverage  industry  is
differentiation;  such as making Hansen's(R)  products visually distinctive from
other  beverages  on the  shelves  of  retailers.  We review  our  products  and
packaging  on an  ongoing  basis and,  where  practical,  endeavor  to make them
different,  better and unique.  The labels and graphics for many of our products
are   redesigned   from  time  to  time  to  maximize   their   visibility   and
identification,  wherever  they may be placed in stores and we will  continue to
reevaluate the same from time to time.

     Where  appropriate  we  partner  with  retailers  to assist  our  marketing
efforts.  For example,  while we retain  responsibility for the marketing of the
Juice  Slam(R)  line  of  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks,  Costco  has
undertaken sole responsibility for the marketing of the Juice Blast(R) line.

     We  increased   expenditures  for  our  sales  and  marketing  programs  by
approximately 22% in 2003 compared to 2002. As of February 28, 2004, we employed
114 employees in sales and marketing activities.

Customers

     Our customers are typically retail and specialty chains,  club stores, mass
merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors and health
food distributors.  In 2003, sales to retailers represented 47% of our revenues,
sales to full service distributors represented 37% of our revenues, and sales to
health food distributors represented 10% of our revenues.

     Our major  customers  include  Costco,  Trader  Joe's,  Sam's  Club,  Vons,
Ralph's,  Wal-Mart,  Safeway  and  Albertson's.   One  customer,  Costco  (which
purchases  a number of  different  products  from  Hansen's  regionally  and one
product  nationally),  accounted for  approximately  15% of our sales in 2003. A
decision by Costco or any other major  customer  to decrease  amounts  purchased
from the  Company  or to cease  carrying  our  products  could  have a  material
negative  effect  on  our  financial  condition  and  consolidated   results  of
operations.

Seasonality

     Sales of ready-to-drink  beverages are somewhat  seasonal,  with the second
and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume
of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather  conditions.  Sales
of  our  beverage   products  may  become   increasingly   subject  to  seasonal
fluctuations as more sales occur outside of California.

Intellectual Property

     We own  numerous  trademarks  that  are  very  important  to our  business.
Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use
and/or their  registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found
to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as
long as the  trademarks are in use. We also own the copyright in and to numerous
statements made and content appearing on the packaging of our products.

     The  Hansen's(R)  trademark is crucial to our business.  This  trademark is
registered  in the U.S.  Patent and  Trademark  Office and in various  countries
throughout the world. The Hansen's(R)  trademark is owned by us and was acquired
from a trust (the "Trust") which was created by an agreement between HBC and the
predecessor company of Fresh Juice Company of California ("FJC") (the "Agreement
of Trust").  The Trust licensed to HBC in perpetuity on an exclusive  world-wide
royalty-free basis the right to use the Hansen's(R) trademark in connection with
the manufacture,  sale and  distribution of carbonated  beverages and waters and
shelf stable fruit juices and drinks containing fruit juices.  In addition,  the
Trust  licensed to HBC, in perpetuity,  on an exclusive  world-wide  basis,  the
right to use the Hansen's(R) trademark in connection with the manufacture,  sale
and distribution of certain non-carbonated  beverages and water in consideration
of royalty payments. There was a similar license agreement between the Trust and
HBC with regard to  non-beverage  products.  No royalties were payable on sodas,
energy drinks, juices,  lemonades,  juice cocktails,  fruit juice Smoothies, the
Signature  Soda  line  or on  the  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks.  As
explained below, no royalty expenses were incurred during 2003, 2002 or 2001.



     HBC, FJC's  predecessor  and the Trust also entered into a Royalty  Sharing
Agreement  pursuant to which royalties  payable by third parties procured by FJC
or its  predecessor  or HBC are initially  shared between the Trust and HBC and,
after a specified  amount of royalties  have been  received,  are shared equally
between HBC and FJC.  Under the terms of the  Agreement  of Trust,  FJC receives
royalty  income  paid to the  Trust in excess  of Trust  expenses  and a reserve
therefor.

     Effective  September 22, 1999, we entered into an Assignment  and Agreement
with FJC pursuant to which we acquired  exclusive  ownership of the  Hansen's(R)
trademark  and trade names.  Under the  Assignment  and  Agreement,  among other
matters,  we acquired all FJC's rights as grantor and  beneficiary of the Trust,
all FJC's rights as licensee under certain license  agreement  pursuant to which
FJC has the right to manufacture, sell and distribute fresh juice products under
the  Hansen's(R)  trademark  and all  FJC's  rights  under the  Royalty  Sharing
Agreement  referred to above, as well as certain  additional rights, for a total
consideration  of  $775,010,  payable  over three  years.  FJC is  permitted  to
continue to  manufacture,  sell and  distribute  fresh juice  products under the
Hansen's(R)  trademark  for a period of five years i.e.  until  September  2004.
Consequently,  we now have full ownership of the  Hansen's(R)  trademark and our
obligation  to pay  royalties  to,  and to share  royalties  with,  FJC has been
terminated.  As of December 31, 2002, the total  consideration  had been paid to
FJC and no further amounts are payable to FJC.

     We have  applied to register a number of  trademarks  in the United  States
including, but not limited to, Hard e(TM), Monster(TM), Monster Energy(TM) and M
(stylized) Monster(TM).

     We own in our own right, a number of trademarks including,  but not limited
to, Hansen's(R), A New Kind a Buzz(R), Unleash the Beast(R), Hansen's energy(R),
Blue   Energy(R),   Energade(R),   Hansen's   E2O  Energy   Water(R),   Hansen's
slim-down(R), Power Formula(R), THE REAL DEAL(R), LIQUIDFRUIT(R),  Imported from
Nature(R),  California's  Natural Choice(R),  California's  Choice(R),  Medicine
Man(R), Dyna Juice(R),  Equator(R),  Hansen's power(R),  bewell(R),  anti-ox(R),
d-stress(R),   stamina(R),   Aqua  Blast(R),   Antioxjuice(R)   Intellijuice(R),
Defense(R), Immunejuice(R),  Hansen's Natural Multi-Vitamin Juice Slam(R), Juice
Blast(R)  and  Red  Rocker(R)  in the  United  States  and the  Hansen's(R)  and
"Smoothie(R)" trademarks in a number of countries around the world.

     In September  2000,  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the Blue Sky
Natural  Beverage  business,  we, through our wholly owned  subsidiary Blue Sky,
acquired the Blue Sky(R) trademark, which is registered in the United States and
Canada.

     In May  2001,  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the  Junior  Juice
Beverage  business,  we,  through  our wholly  owned  subsidiary  Junior  Juice,
acquired  the  Junior  Juice(R)  trademark,  which is  registered  in the United
States.

     On April 4, 2000,  the United States  Patent and Trademark  Office issued a
patent to us for an invention  related to a shelf structure  (rolling rack) and,
more particularly,  a shelf structure for a walk-in cooler. Such shelf structure
is utilized by us to secure  shelf space for and to  merchandise  our energy and
functional  drinks in cans in  refrigerated  Visi coolers and walk-in coolers in
retail stores.



Government Regulation

     The production,  distribution  and sale in the United States of many of our
products is subject to the Federal  Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act;  the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational  Safety and Health
Act; various environmental  statutes; and various other federal, state and local
statutes and  regulations  applicable to the production,  transportation,  sale,
safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.

     In  connection  with Hard e, the  production  and  marketing  of  alcoholic
beverages  is subject  to the rules and  regulations  of the Bureau of  Alcohol,
Tobacco  and  Firearms  and in each  state,  is also  subject  to the  rules and
regulations of state  regulatory  agencies.  The Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and
Firearms and state regulatory  agencies also regulate the labeling of containers
containing  alcoholic  beverages  including,   without  limitation,   statements
concerning product name and ingredients as well as advertising and marketing, in
connection therewith.

     California law requires that a specific  warning appear on any product that
contains a component listed by the State as having been found to cause cancer or
birth  defects.  The  law  exposes  all  food  and  beverage  producers  to  the
possibility  of having to provide  warnings  on their  products  because the law
recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning
is not  required.  Consequently,  even trace  amounts of listed  components  can
expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels.  Products containing
listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to
the product  solely by a municipal  water supply are  generally  exempt from the
warning requirement. While none of our beverage products are required to display
warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any
of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are
unable to predict  whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have
an impact on costs or sales of our products.

     Bottlers  of  our  beverage   products   presently  offer   non-refillable,
recyclable  containers  in all areas of the United  States and  Canada.  Some of
these  bottlers also offer  refillable  containers,  which are also  recyclable.
Measures have been enacted in various  localities and states that require that a
deposit be charged for certain non-refillable  beverage containers.  The precise
requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product
stewardship  proposals  have been  introduced  in states and  localities  and in
Congress,  and we anticipate  that similar  legislation  or  regulations  may be
proposed  in the  future at the local,  state and  federal  levels,  both in the
United States and elsewhere.

     Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local
environmental  laws and  regulations.  Compliance with these  provisions has not
had, and we do not expect such  compliance to have, any material  adverse effect
upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Employees

     As of February 28, 2004, we employed a total of 173 employees,  159 persons
on a full-time basis. Of our 173 employees,  we employ 59 in administrative  and
quality control capacities and 114 persons in sales and marketing capacities. We
have  not  experienced  any  work  stoppages,  and we  consider  relations  with
our employees to be good.

Compliance with Environmental Laws

     In  California,  we are  required  to collect  redemption  values  from our
customers  and to remit  such  redemption  values  to the  State  of  California
Department of Conservation  based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain
carbonated and non-carbonated  products sold. In certain other states and Canada
where  Hansen's(R)  products are sold, we are also required to collect  deposits
from our customers and to remit such deposits to the  respective  state agencies
based  upon  the  number  of  cans  and  bottles  of  certain   carbonated   and
non-carbonated products, sold in such states.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     Our  corporate  offices and main  warehouse  are  located at 1010  Railroad
Street, Corona, California 92882. Our lease for this facility expires in October
2010.  The  area  of  the  facility  is   approximately   113,600  square  feet.
Additionally,  in January 2004 we entered into a lease for additional  warehouse
space in Corona,  California.  The area of this facility is approximately 80,000
square  feet.  This lease will expire at the end of March 2008 with an option to
extend the lease until October 2010. We also rent additional  warehouse space on
a short-term basis from time to time in public  warehouses  situated  throughout
the United States and Canada.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In March 2001, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Central  District of  California  against South Beach  Beverage  Company LLC
("Sobe"),  for  patent  infringement,   violation  of  trademark  rights,  false
advertising, unfair competition,  trespass to chattels and tortious interference
with business  relations  arising from Sobe's unlawful  conduct and unauthorized
use of our  property  and our  patent  in  respect  of our  rolling  rack  shelf
structure,  Sobe's improper business  practices,  interference with our right to
conduct  business,   injunctive  relief  and  unspecified  monetary  damages.  A
settlement  agreement was concluded  between the parties and pursuant  thereto a
consent  judgment and permanent  injunction was issued pursuant to which Sobe is
enjoined from certain conduct and competitive activities.

     In December 2002, a non-profit  organization  describing itself as Citizens
for Responsible  Business Inc., filed a complaint  against us together with more
than  a  hundred  additional  defendants  comprising  retailers,   distributors,
manufacturers  and suppliers,  in the Superior  Court of San Francisco.  In that
complaint,  the plaintiff  sought  preliminary and permanent  injunctive  relief
enjoining  the Company  and all other  defendants  from  selling  food  products
advertised  as "ginseng" or "siberian  ginseng" that are not derived from plants
classified within the genus "panax", for restitution and disgourgement of monies
obtained from the sale of products advertised as "ginseng" or "siberian ginseng"
which were not derived from plants  classified  within the genus "panax" or were
derived from  eleuthero  plants,  attorneys  fees and other relief.  In or about
April 2003 the action was settled and the Company was dismissed from the case on
terms favorable to the Company.

     During 2002, in response to our cease and desist letter to Skyy Spirits LLC
in which we alleged infringement by Skyy Spirits and/or its licensee of our Blue
Sky(R)  trademark,  Skyy Spirits filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the  Northern  District  of  California  for a  declaratory  order and
additional  relief.  We filed a  counterclaim  against  Skyy  Spirits and joined
Miller Brewing  Company in the proceedings in which we have sought an injunction
and claimed  damages,  including an accounting  for profits  earned by both Skyy
Spirits and Miller Brewing  Company,  from the sale of the  infringing  beverage
products and further  relief.  The trial in this matter has been  scheduled  for
hearing in April 2004.



     During 2003,  in response to a cease and desist  letter from the  Coca-Cola
Company and its subsidiary Odwalla,  Inc. in which they complained of the use by
us of the Monster  trademark and name, we filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the Southern  District of California for a declaratory  order
and additional relief. The Company is engaged in settlement discussions with the
Coca-Cola  Company and Odwalla,  Inc. If no settlement  is reached,  the Company
will  vigorously  pursue  the  matter.  The  Company  believes  that it has good
prospects of success.

     Furthermore,  we are subject to litigation  from time to time in the normal
course of  business.  Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of such
litigation,  based on the facts known to us and after consultation with counsel,
we believe that such litigation  will not have a material  adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

     Except as described above,  there are no material pending legal proceedings
to  which  we or any of our  subsidiaries  is a  party  or to  which  any of our
properties is subject,  other than ordinary and routine litigation incidental to
our business.

Our Business

     Overview

     We  develop,  market,  sell and  distribute,  in the main,  a wide range of
branded  beverages.  The  majority  of our  beverages  fall  within the  growing
"alternative"  beverage  category.  The  principal  brand  names under which our
beverages are marketed are Hansen's(R),  Monster Energy(TM), Blue Sky(R), Junior
Juice(R),  and Lost(R).  We own all of our  above-listed  brand names other than
Lost(R)  which we  produce,  market,  sell  and  distribute  under an  exclusive
licensing arrangement with Lost International LLC.

     Our  company  principally  generates  revenues,  income  and cash  flows by
developing,  producing,  marketing,  selling and distributing  finished beverage
products. We generally sell these products to retailers as well as distributors.

     We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands including
advertising costs,  sponsorship fees and special promotional events. We focus on
developing  brand  awareness  and trial  through  sampling both in stores and at
events.  Retailers and distributors receive rebates,  promotions,  point of sale
materials, merchandise displays and coolers. We also use in-store promotions and
in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price
promotions,  competitions,  and sponsorship of, and endorsements from,  selected
public and  extreme  sports  figures  and  causes.  Consumers  receive  coupons,
discounts and  promotional  incentives.  These  marketing  expenditures  help to
enhance  distribution  and availability of our products as well as awareness and
increase  consumer   preference  for  our  brands.   Greater   distribution  and
availability, awareness and preference promotes long term growth.

     During 2003, we continued to expand our existing  product lines and further
develop our  markets.  In  particular,  we continue to focus on  developing  and
marketing  beverages  that fall within the category  generally  described as the
"alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks.

     We  believe  that one of the keys to success in the  beverage  industry  is
differentiation;  such as making Hansen's(R)  products visually distinctive from
other  beverages  on the  shelves  of  retailers.  We review  our  products  and
packaging  on an  ongoing  basis and,  where  practical,  endeavor  to make them
different,  better and unique.  The labels and graphics for many of our products
are   redesigned   from  time  to  time  to  maximize   their   visibility   and
identification,  wherever  they may be placed in stores and we will  continue to
reevaluate the same from time to time.

     We again achieved record sales in 2003. The increase in gross and net sales
in 2003 was  primarily  attributable  to sales of our Monster  Energy(R)  drink,
which was introduced in April 2002,  including our low carbohydrate  ("lo-carb")
Monster Energy(R) drink which was introduced in 2003, as well as increased sales
of Natural  Sodas,  in particular  Diet Natural  Sodas,  our Energy Deuce drink,
Junior  Juice,  Diet  Energy,  apple  juice and, to a lesser  extent,  sparkling
beverages. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased
sales  primarily  of energy  drinks in  8.3-ounce  cans,  Smoothies,  E2O Energy
Water(R),  Soy Smoothies,  Energade(R) energy sports drinks, and teas, lemonades
and cocktails.

     During 2003,  sales outside of California  represented 47% of our aggregate
sales, as compared to approximately 42% of our aggregate sales in 2002. Sales to
distributors  outside  the United  States  during 2003  amounted  to  $1,612,000
compared to $1,242,000 in 2002.

     Our customers are typically retail and specialty chains,  club stores, mass
merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors and health
food distributors.  In 2003, sales to retailers represented 47% of our revenues,
sales to full service distributors  represented 37% of our revenues and sales to
health food distributors represented 10% of our revenues.



     In 2003,  we introduced a carbonated  lo-carb  Monster  Energy(R)  drink in
16-ounce  cans,  a carbonated  energy Deuce drink in 16-ounce  cans, a diet root
beer Natural Soda, a 100% Apple Juice in aseptic  pouches,  and regular and diet
sparkling Lemonades and Orangeades in 12-ounce glass bottles.

     Sales of our dual-branded 100% juice line named "Juice Blast(R)", which was
launched  in  conjunction  with  Costco and is sold  nationally  through  Costco
stores,  were lower in 2003 than in 2002. We have, in  conjunction  with Costco,
introduced  new  flavors in place of certain of the  existing  flavors  and will
continue to  introduce  new flavors in an effort to ensure that the variety pack
remains fresh and different for consumers.

     In  September  2000,  HBC,  through its wholly owned  subsidiary  Blue Sky,
acquired the Blue Sky(R)  Natural Soda  business.  The Blue Sky(R)  Natural Soda
brand is the leading  natural  soda in the health  food  trade.  Blue Sky offers
natural sodas,  premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and
anti-oxidant  vitamins,  organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a
Blue Energy drink in  8.3-ounce  cans.  During the year,  we continued to expand
distribution  of the Blue Sky  products  into  mainstream  grocery  chain stores
throughout the country.

     In May 2001,  HBC,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Junior  Juice,
acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business. The Junior Juice(R) product line
is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce  aseptic packages and
is targeted at toddlers.

     During 2003, we entered into several new  distribution  agreements  for the
sale of our products,  both within and outside the United  States.  As discussed
under "ITEM 1 BUSINESS - MANUFACTURE  and  DISTRIBUTION",  we anticipate that we
will continue  building our national sales force in 2004 to support and grow the
sales of our products.

     A chain grocery store strike in Southern California, which commenced during
the last quarter of 2003, adversely affected sales of those of our products that
are carried by the stores concerned. However, the drop in sales of such products
was partially  offset by increased  sales of certain of those  products that are
carried by other retailers in Southern California.

     In 2002,  we  introduced a Sparkling  Cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5 liter
Magnum glass bottle.  However,  due to limited reports of some bottles breaking,
we promptly  recalled  the  product.  We are  pursuing a claim for the costs and
losses incurred by us. We will reevaluate  relaunching this product once certain
production issues are resolved to our satisfaction.

     At the beginning of 2004, we launched a new  carbonated  energy drink under
the Lost(R)  brand name,  in a 16-ounce  can. The Lost(R) brand name is owned by
Lost  International LLC and the drinks are produced,  sold and distributed by us
under exclusive license from Lost International LLC.

     During  2004,  we were  awarded  an  exclusive  contract  by the  State  of
California,   Department  of  Health   Services   Women,   Infant  and  Children
Supplemental  Nutrition  Branch, to supply 100% Apple juice and 100% Apple Grape
juice in 64-ounce PET plastic  bottles.  See "ITEM 1 BUSINESS - MANUFACTURE  and
DISTRIBUTION."

     We continue to incur  expenditures  in connection  with the development and
introduction of new products and flavors.

     Value Drivers of our Business

     We  believe  that  the  key  value  drivers  of our  business  include  the
following:

o    Profitable  Growth - We  believe  healthy  brands - properly  supported  by
     marketing  and  innovation,   targeted  to  a  broad  consumer   base-drive
     profitable  growth.  We  continue  to  broaden  our  family of  brands.  In
     particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy
     drinks to  provide  more  alternatives  to  consumers.  We are  focused  on
     maintaining or increasing  profit margins.  We believe that tailored brand,
     package,  price and channel  strategies help achieve  profitable growth. We
     are implementing  these  strategies with a view to accelerating  profitable
     growth.



o    Cost  Management - The principal  focus of cost management will continue to
     be on supplies and cost reduction.  One key area of focus, for example,  is
     to  decrease  raw  material   costs,   co-packing   fees  and  general  and
     administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key
     area of focus is the  reduction in inventory  levels.  However,  due to the
     expansion in the number of our  products as well as increased  sales levels
     in 2003, overall inventory levels increased.

o    Efficient Capital Structure - Our capital structure is intended to optimize
     our costs of capital.  We believe our strong capital position,  our ability
     to raise funds at low  effective  cost and  overall low costs of  borrowing
     provide a competitive advantage.

     We believe that these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result
in (1)  maintaining  and  improving  our  gross  profit  margin;  (2)  providing
additional  leverage over time through  reduced  expenses as a percentage of net
operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure
of  success  is and will be  reflected  in our  current  and  future  results of
operations.

     Gross and net operating revenues, gross profits,  operating income, and net
income and net income per share  represent key  measurements  of the above value
drivers.  In 2003,  gross operating  revenues  totaled $138.5  million,  a 19.9%
increase from 2002. Net operating  revenues totaled $110.4 million,  an increase
of 19.9% over 2002. Gross profit totaled $43.8 million in 2003, a 31.7% increase
from 2002.  Operating income was $9.8 million compared to $5.3 million for 2002.
Net income was $5.9 million as compared to $3.0 million for 2002. Net income per
share  (diluted)  was  $0.55  from  $0.29  per  diluted  share  in  2002.  These
measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2004 and beyond.  See
also "Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the
Year Ended December 31, 2002.

     In 2003, the Company had working  capital of $17.2 million  compared to $15
million as of December 31,  2002.  In 2003,  our net cash  provided by operating
activities was approximately $5.5 million, a 101% increase from 2002.  Principal
uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory,  increases in accounts receivable
and other assets,  acquisition of property and equipment and trademark  licenses
and  trademarks.  Repayment of our debt and accounts  payable are expected to be
and remain our principal  recurring use of cash and working  capital funds.  See
also LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

     Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

     Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks
that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our company.  Increase in
consumer and regulatory  awareness of the health  problems  arising from obesity
and inactive lifestyles  represents a challenge.  We recognize that obesity is a
complex and serious public health  problem.  Our commitment to consumers  begins
with our broad  product  line and a wide  selection  of diet,  light and lo-carb
beverages,  juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks.
We  continuously  strive  to  meet  changing  consumer  needs  through  beverage
innovation, choice and variety.

     Our historical  success is  attributable,  in part, to our  introduction of
different and innovative  beverages.  Our future  success will depend,  in part,
upon our  continued  ability to develop and introduce  different and  innovative
beverages,  although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order
to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce
different and  innovative  beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality,
health,   method  of  distribution,   brand  image  and  intellectual   property
protection.  The beverage industry is subject to changing  consumer  preferences
and shifts in consumer  preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge
such preferences.



     In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company's
future financial results include, but are not limited to:

     o    maintenance of our brand images and product quality;

     o    profitable  expansion  and  growth  of our  family  of  brands  in the
          competitive market place (See also "ITEM 1 BUSINESS - COMPETITION" and
          "SALES AND MARKETING");

     o    restrictions  on imports  and  sources of supply;  duties or  tariffs;
          changes  in  government  regulations;  o  protection  of our  existing
          intellectual  property  portfolio of trademark licenses and trademarks
          and the continuous  pursuit of new and  innovative  trademarks for our
          expanding product lines; and

     o    the imposition of additional restrictions.

     We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:

     o    growth potential for  non-alcoholic  beverage  categories  including -
          energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports
          drinks and water;

     o    new product  introductions  intended  to  contribute  to higher  gross
          profits;

     o    premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth;

     o    significant  package,  pricing and channel  opportunities  to maximize
          profitable growth; and

     o    proper positioning to capture industry growth.





Results of Operations


     Results of Operations  for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the
Year Ended December 31, 2002

     Gross Sales.  For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross sales were $138.5
million, an increase of $23.0 million or 19.9% higher than gross sales of $115.5
million for the year ended  December  31,  2002.  The increase in gross sales is
primarily  attributable to the  introduction of new products and increased sales
of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales."

     Net Sales.  For the year ended  December  31,  2003,  net sales were $110.4
million,  an increase of $18.3  million or 19.9%  higher than net sales of $92.0
million for the year ended  December  31,  2002.  The  increase in net sales was
primarily  attributable  to sales of our  Monster  Energy(TM)  drink,  which was
introduced in April 2002, as well as increased  sales of Natural  Sodas,  Junior
Juice and, to a lesser extent,  sparkling  beverages.  The increase in net sales
was partially  offset by decreased sales of functional  drinks,  smoothies,  E2O
Energy Water,  Energade(R)  energy sports drinks,  and children's  multi-vitamin
juice drinks as well as an increase in  discounts,  allowances  and  promotional
payments.

     Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $43.8  million for the year ended  December
31, 2003,  an increase of $10.5  million or 31.7% over the $33.2  million  gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2002. Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales was 39.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003 which was higher than gross
profit as a  percentage  of net sales of 36.1% for the year ended  December  31,
2002. The increase in gross profit was primarily  attributable  to increased net
sales.  Although a greater  percentage of our sales  comprised  products  having
higher  gross  margins than the prior year,  the increase in profit  margins was
partially reduced by higher  promotional  payments and allowances to promote our
products.



     Total Operating  Expenses.  Total operating expenses were $33.9 million for
the year ended  December  31,  2003,  an increase of $6.0  million or 21.5% over
total operating  expenses of $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Total  operating  expenses as a percentage  of net sales  slightly  increased to
30.8% for the year  ended  December  31,  2003,  from  30.4% for the year  ended
December  31,  2002.  The increase in total  operating  expenses  was  primarily
attributable to increased  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses.  The
increase in total operating  expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily
attributable  to the  comparatively  larger  increase  in  selling,  general and
administrative expenses than the increase in net sales.

     Selling,  General and Administrative.  Selling,  general and administrative
expenses were $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of
$6.0 million or 21.5% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $27.9
million  for  the  year  ended   December   31,  2002.   Selling,   general  and
administrative  expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.7% for the
year ended  December  31, 2003 from 30.3% for the year ended  December 31, 2002.
Selling  expenses  were $20.1  million for the year ended  December 31, 2003, an
increase of $4.0 million or 25.1% over selling expenses of $16.1 million for the
year ended  December 31,  2002.  Selling  expenses as a percentage  of net sales
increased to 18.2% for the year ended  December 31, 2003 from 17.4% for the year
ended  December  31,  2002.  The  increase  in selling  expenses  was  primarily
attributable to increased  distribution  (freight) and storage  expenses,  trade
development activities including cooperative arrangements with our distributors,
sponsorships and promotions,  in-store  demonstrations and merchandise  displays
which was partially  offset by decreased  expenditures  for graphic  design.  In
addition,  we  incurred  expenses  of  approximately  $267,000  during  2003  in
connection with our sponsorship of the Las Vegas Monorail as part of our efforts
to promote our Monster product line.  General and  administrative  expenses were
$13.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 2003, an increase of $2.0 million
or 16.6% over general and administrative  expenses of $11.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002. General and administrative  expenses as a percentage of
net sales were 12.5% for the year ended  December  31,  2003 which was  slightly
lower than general and  administrative  expenses as a percentage of net sales of
12.9% for the year  ended  December  31,  2002.  The  increase  in  general  and
administrative  expenses was  primarily  attributable  to an increase in payroll
costs  as we  expanded  our  headcount,  as well  as fees  paid  for  legal  and
accounting services and increased travel and insurance expenses. The decrease in
general and  administrative  expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily
attributable to the increase in net sales and the  comparatively  lower increase
in payroll costs.

     Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark
license and  trademarks  was $62,000 for the year ended  December 31,  2003,  an
increase of $7,000 from  amortization  of trademark  license and  trademarks  of
$55,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2002. The increase in  amortization  of
trademark license and trademarks was due to the acquisition of trademarks during
the year ended December 31, 2003.

     Operating  Income.  Operating  income was $9.8  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2003,  compared to $5.3  million for the year ended  December 31,
2002. The $4.5 million increase in operating  income was primarily  attributable
to increased gross profits,  which was partially  offset by increased  operating
expenses.

     Net Nonoperating Expense. Net nonoperating expense was $67,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2003, which was $161,000 lower than net nonoperating  expense
of $228,000  for the year ended  December  31, 2002.  Net  nonoperating  expense
consists of interest and  financing  expense and interest  income.  Interest and
financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $73,000,  as compared
to $231,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2002.  The decrease in interest and
financing  expense was  primarily  attributable  to decreased  interest  expense
incurred on our borrowings  which was primarily  attributable to the decrease in
outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates.  Interest and royalty income
for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $6,000,  as compared to interest income
of $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in interest  income
was primarily  attributable  to an increase in the cash available for investment
during the year ended December 31, 2003.



     Provision for Income  Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December  31, 2003 was $3.8  million  which was an  increase of $1.8  million as
compared to the  provision  for income  taxes of $2.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002.  The  increase in  provision  for income taxes was  primarily
attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal
and state tax rate for 2003 was 39.2%,  which was lower than the  effective  tax
rate of 40.2% for 2002 due to the  increase  in the  apportionment  of sales and
related state taxes to various states outside of California.

     Net Income.  Net income was $5.9  million for the year ended  December  31,
2003,  which was an increase  of $2.9  million as compared to net income of $3.0
million for the year ended  December  31,  2002.  The increase in net income was
primarily  attributable  to the  $10.5  million  increase  in gross  profit  and
decrease in  nonoperating  expense of $161,000  for the year ended  December 31,
2003 which was partially offset by increased  operating expenses of $6.0 million
and an increase in the provision of income taxes of $1.8 million.

     Results of Operations  for the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the
Year Ended December 31, 2001

     Gross Sales.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, gross sales were $115.5
million,  an increase of $15.8 million or 15.8% higher than gross sales of $80.7
million for the year ended  December  31,  2001.  The increase in gross sales is
primarily  attributable to the  introduction of new products and increased sales
of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales."

     Net  Sales.  For the year ended  December  31,  2002,  net sales were $92.0
million,  an increase of $11.3  million or 14.1%  higher than net sales of $80.7
million for the year ended  December  31,  2001.  The  increase in net sales was
primarily  attributable  to sales  of our  Monster  EnergyTM  drink,  which  was
introduced  in April 2002,  as well as  increased  sales of Natural  Sodas,  E2O
Energy Water(R),  which was introduced in June 2001,  Energade(R)  energy sports
drinks,  which were  introduced in July 2001,  apple juice,  and Soy  Smoothies,
which were introduced in December 2001. We also  benefited,  to a lesser extent,
from  increased  sales of the  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks,  Junior
Juice(R),  which was  acquired  in May 2001,  and  smoothies  in P.E.T.  plastic
bottles.  The increase in net sales was partially  offset by decreased  sales of
Signature  Soda, Hard e, functional  drinks,  teas,  lemonades and cocktails and
smoothies  in  cans  as  well  as  an  increase  in  discounts,  allowances  and
promotional payments, notably higher coupon costs.

     Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $33.2  million for the year ended  December
31,  2002,  an increase of $4.3  million or 15.2% over the $28.9  million  gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2001. Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales was 36.1% for the year ended  December 31, 2002 which was slightly  higher
than  gross  profit as a  percentage  of net  sales of 35.8% for the year  ended
December 31, 2001.  The increase in gross profit was primarily  attributable  to
increased  net  sales.  Although  a greater  percentage  of our sales  comprised
products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit
margins was reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our
products notably higher coupon costs.

     Total Operating  Expenses.  Total operating expenses were $28.0 million for
the year ended  December  31,  2002,  an increase of $4.7  million or 19.9% over
total operating  expenses of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Total  operating  expenses as a percentage of net sales  increased to 30.4 % for
the year ended  December  31, 2002,  from 28.9% for the year ended  December 31,
2001. The increase in total  operating  expenses was primarily  attributable  to
increased selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  The increase in total
operating  expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily  attributable  to
the  comparatively  larger  increase  in  selling,  general  and  administrative
expenses than the increase in net sales.



     Selling,  General and Administrative.  Selling,  general and administrative
expenses were $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of
$5.1 million or 22.3% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $22.8
million  for  the  year  ended   December   31,  2001.   Selling,   general  and
administrative  expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.3% for the
year ended  December 31, 2002,  from 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Selling  expenses  were $16.1  million for the year ended  December 31, 2002, an
increase of $3.7 million or 29.9% over selling expenses of $12.4 million for the
year ended  December 31,  2001.  Selling  expenses as a percentage  of net sales
increased to 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2002, from 15.3% for the year
ended  December  31,  2001.  The  increase  in selling  expenses  was  primarily
attributable  to  increased   distribution   (freight)  and  storage   expenses,
advertising,   point-of-sale   materials  and  merchandise  displays,   in-store
demonstrations  and  graphic  design.  The  increase  in  selling  expenses  was
partially  offset by a  decrease  in  expenditures  for  premiums.  General  and
administrative expenses were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
an increase of $1.4 million or 13.3% over general and administrative expenses of
$10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  General and  administrative
expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the year ended December 31,
2002 which was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in
general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in
payroll  costs,  charitable  contributions,  fees paid for legal and  accounting
services  and   increased   travel   expenses  as  well  as  other  general  and
administrative  expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as
a  percentage  of net sales was  primarily  attributable  to the increase in net
sales and the comparatively lower increase in payroll costs.

     Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark
license and  trademarks  was $55,000 for the year ended  December  31,  2002,  a
decrease of $452,000 from  amortization  of trademark  license and trademarks of
$507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in  amortization  of
trademark  license  and  trademarks  was due to the  adoption  of  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 142 in the first  quarter of 2002
(Note  1  of  the  financial   statements)  which  eliminated   amortization  on
indefinite-lived intangible assets.

     Operating  Income.  Operating  income was $5.3  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2002,  compared to $5.6  million for the year ended  December 31,
2001. The $258,000  decrease in operating  income was primarily  attributable to
increased  operating  expenses,  which was partially  offset by increased  gross
profit.

     Net Nonoperating  Expense.  Net  nonoperating  expense was $228,000 for the
year ended  December 31, 2002,  which was $291,000  lower than net  nonoperating
expense of $519,000  for the year ended  December  31,  2001.  Net  nonoperating
expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest
and  financing  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2002 was  $231,000,  as
compared to $528,000  for the year ended  December  31,  2001.  The  decrease in
interest and financing expense was primarily  attributable to decreased interest
expense  incurred on our  borrowings  which was  primarily  attributable  to the
decrease in outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates.  Interest income
for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $3,000,  as compared to interest income
of $9,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest  income
was primarily  attributable  to a reduction in the cash available for investment
during the year ended December 31, 2002.

     Provision for Income  Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was $2.0 million  which was  comparable  to the  provision for
income taxes of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective
combined federal and state tax rate for 2002 was 40.2%,  which was comparable to
the effective tax rate of 40.0% for 2001.

     Net Income.  Net income was $3.0  million for the year ended  December  31,
2002,  which was  comparable to net income for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The $4.3 million  increase in gross profit and decrease in nonoperating  expense
of  $291,000  for the year  ended  December  31,  2002 was  offset by  increased
operating expenses of $4.7 million.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

     As of December 31, 2003,  the Company had working  capital of  $17,196,000,
compared to working capital of $14,950,000 as of December 31, 2002. The increase
in  working  capital  was  primarily  attributable  to net income  earned  after
adjustments  for certain  noncash  expenses,  primarily  depreciation  and other
amortization,  amortization of trademark license and trademarks,  and a decrease
in deposits and other assets and an increase in deferred  income taxes which was
partially  offset by payments made in reduction of long-term  debt and increased
expenditures for the acquisition of property, trademark license and trademarks.

     Net cash provided by operating  activities  for the year ended December 31,
2003 was  $5,484,000,  compared to cash  provided  by  operating  activities  of
$2,727,000  during 2002.  The increase in cash provided by operating  activities
was primarily attributable to decreases in accounts receivable,  and an increase
in accounts payable,  income taxes payable,  accrued  compensation,  and accrued
liabilities which was partially offset by increases in inventories. Purchases of
inventories,  increases in accounts receivable and other assets,  acquisition of
property and equipment,  acquisition of trademark  licenses and trademarks,  and
repayment of our line of credit and accounts  payable are expected to remain our
principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds.

     Net cash used in investing  activities for the year ended December 31, 2003
was $2,438,000 as compared to net cash used in investment  activities of $92,000
in 2002.  The increase in net cash used in investing  activities  was  primarily
attributable to increased purchases of property and equipment and an increase in
trademarks as well as a decrease in  expenditures  for deposits and other assets
in 2003 which was  partially  offset by proceeds  from the sale of property  and
equipment.  Management,  from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital
equipment,  particularly,  specific  items of production  equipment  required to
produce certain of our products, merchandise display racks, vans and promotional
vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment and businesses compatible with
the image of the Hansen's(R)  brand, as well as the  introduction of new product
lines.

     Net cash used in financing  activities  was  $2,486,000 for the year ending
December  31,  2003,  as compared to net cash used in  financing  activities  of
$2,344,000  in 2002.  The increase in net cash used in financing  activities  as
compared to the prior year was  primarily  attributable  to increased  principal
payments of long-term  debt,  which was partially  offset by increased  proceeds
from the issuance of common stock during 2003.

     HBC has a  credit  facility  from  Comerica  Bank-California  ("Comerica"),
consisting of a revolving line of credit and a term loan. The utilization of the
revolving  line of credit by HBC was dependent  upon certain  levels of eligible
accounts  receivable  and inventory  from time to time.  Such  revolving line of
credit and term loan are secured by substantially all of HBC's assets, including
accounts  receivable,  inventory,  trademarks,  trademark  licenses  and certain
equipment.  In accordance  with the provisions of the credit  facility,  HBC can
borrow up to $12.0 million under its line of credit, reducing to $6.0 million by
September  2004.  The revolving  line of credit remains in full force and effect
through September 2005. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based
on bank's base (prime) rate, plus an additional  percentage of up to 0.5% or the
LIBOR rate, plus an additional  percentage of up to 2.5%, depending upon certain
financial  ratios of HBC from time to time.  At December  31,  2003,  HBC had no
balances  outstanding under the credit facility and borrowing capacity available
to the Company from Comerica under the credit facility was $7,800,000.

     The  terms  of the  Company's  line of  credit  contain  certain  financial
covenants including certain financial ratios and annual net income requirements.
The line of credit contains  provisions  under which  applicable  interest rates
will be adjusted in increments  based on the  achievement  of certain  financial
ratios.  The Company was in compliance with its financial  ratios and annual net
income  requirements  and  obtained a waiver from  Comerica  with regards to its
capital expenditure limitations at December 31, 2003.



     If any event of default  shall occur for any reason,  whether  voluntary or
involuntary,  Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of
credit  immediately due and payable,  exercise rights and remedies  available to
secured parties under the Uniform  Commercial Code,  institute legal proceedings
to foreclose upon the lien and security  interest granted or for the sale of any
or all collateral.

     Purchase  obligations  represent  commitments  made by the  Company and its
subsidiaries  to various  suppliers for raw materials used in the  manufacturing
and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms.

     Other  commitments  represent our obligations  under our agreement with the
Las Vegas Monorail Company. See also "ITEM 1 - SALES AND MARKETING."

     The following represents a summary of the Company's contractual obligations
and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2003:



     Management  believes that cash  available from  operations,  including cash
resources and the revolving  line of credit,  will be sufficient for our working
capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials, payments of tax
liabilities,  debt  servicing,  expansion and  development  needs,  purchases of
shares of our  common  stock,  as well as any  purchases  of  capital  assets or
equipment through December 31, 2004.

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements

     Critical Accounting Policies

     The Company's  consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting  principals  generally  accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP".)  GAAP  requires the Company to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that
affect the reported amounts in our consolidated  financial  statements including
various  allowances and reserves for accounts  receivable and  inventories,  the
estimated  lives of long-lived  assets and trademarks and trademark  licenses as
well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions
that occur in the normal  course of  business.The  following  summarize the most
significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company:

     Trademark  License  and  Trademarks  -  Trademark  license  and  trademarks
     primarily  represent the Company's  exclusive  ownership of the Hansen's(R)
     trademark in connection  with the  manufacture,  sale and  distribution  of
     beverages and water and non-beverage products. The Company also owns in its
     own right, a number of other  trademarks in the United States as well as in
     a number of  countries  around the world.  The  Company  also owns the Blue
     Sky(R)  trademark,  which was  acquired in September  2000,  and the Junior
     Juice(R)  trademark,  which was  acquired  in May 2001.  During  2002,  the
     Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under
     the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company  discontinued  amortization  on
     indefinite-lived  trademark  licenses and  trademarks  while  continuing to
     amortize remaining trademark licenses and trademarks over one to 25 years.



     In  accordance  with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate  our  trademark  license and
     trademarks  annually for  impairment.  We measure  impairment by the amount
     that the carrying  value exceeds the estimated  fair value of the trademark
     license  and  trademarks.  The fair  value is  calculated  using the income
     approach.  Based on our annual impairment  analysis performed in the fourth
     quarter  of 2003,  the  estimated  fair  values of  trademark  license  and
     trademarks exceeded the carrying value.

     Long-Lived Assets - Management regularly reviews property and equipment and
     other long-lived assets,  including certain identifiable  intangibles,  for
     possible  impairment.  This review occurs  annually,  or more frequently if
     events or changes in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  amount of the
     asset may not be  recoverable.  If there is  indication  of  impairment  of
     property and equipment or amortizable  intangible  assets,  then management
     prepares  an  estimate  of future  cash  flows  (undiscounted  and  without
     interest  charges)  expected  to  result  from the use of the asset and its
     eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount
     of the asset,  an impairment  loss is recognized to write down the asset to
     its estimated fair value.  The fair value is estimated at the present value
     of  the  future  cash  flows  discounted  at  a  rate   commensurate   with
     management's  estimates of the business  risks.  Annually,  or earlier,  if
     there is  indication of  impairment  of  identified  intangible  assets not
     subject to amortization,  management compares the estimated fair value with
     the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write
     down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying
     amount.  Preparation of estimated  expected future cash flows is inherently
     subjective  and is based  on  management's  best  estimate  of  assumptions
     concerning expected future conditions. No impairments were identified as of
     December 31, 2003.

     Management  believes that the accounting  estimate related to impairment of
     its long lived assets, including its trademark license and trademarks, is a
     "critical  accounting  estimate"  because:  (1) it is highly susceptible to
     change from period to period because it requires company management to make
     assumptions  about cash flows and discount  rates;  and (2) the impact that
     recognizing  an  impairment  would  have  on  the  assets  reported  on our
     consolidated  balance  sheet,  as well as net  income,  could be  material.
     Management's  assumptions  about  cash  flows and  discount  rates  require
     significant  judgment  because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated
     in the past and are expected to continue to do so.

     In estimating future revenues,  we use internal  budgets.  Internal budgets
     are developed based on recent revenues data for existing  product lines and
     planned timing of future  introductions of new products and their impact on
     our future cash flows.

     Advertising  and  Promotional   Allowances  -  The  Company   accounts  for
     advertising  production  costs by expensing such production costs the first
     time the related advertising takes place. In addition, the Company supports
     its customers with promotional  allowances,  a portion of which is utilized
     for marketing and indirect  advertising  by them. In certain  instances,  a
     portion of the  promotional  allowances  payable to customers  based on the
     levels of sales to such customers,  promotion  requirements or expected use
     of the  allowances,  are  estimated by the Company.  If the level of sales,
     promotion  requirements  or use of the  allowances  are different from such
     estimates,  the  promotional  allowances  could,  to the  extent  based  on
     estimates,  require adjustments.  During 2002, the Company adopted Emerging
     Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 01-9 which requires certain sales promotions
     and  customer  allowances  previously  classified  as selling,  general and
     administrative expenses to be classified as a reduction of sales or as cost
     of goods sold.  The Company has conformed its  presentation  of advertising
     and promotional allowances to comply with the provisions of EITF No. 01-9.

     Accounts Receivable - The Company evaluates the collectibility of its trade
     accounts  receivable based on a number of factors.  In circumstances  where
     the Company  becomes aware of a specific  customer's  inability to meet its
     financial  obligations to the Company,  a specific reserve for bad debts is
     estimated  and recorded  which  reduces the  recognized  receivable  to the
     estimated  amount the Company  believes will  ultimately  be collected.  In
     addition to specific  customer  identification  of potential bad debts, bad
     debt charges are recorded  based on the Company's  recent past loss history
     and  an  overall   assessment  of  past  due  trade   accounts   receivable
     outstanding.



     Inventories  -  Inventories  are  stated at the  lower of cost to  purchase
     and/or  manufacture the inventory or the current  estimated market value of
     the inventory.  The Company regularly  reviews its inventory  quantities on
     hand and  records a  provision  for excess  and  obsolete  inventory  based
     primarily on the Company's  estimated forecast of product demand and/or its
     ability to sell the products concerned and production requirements.  Demand
     for the Company's products can fluctuate significantly. Factors which could
     affect demand for the Company's products include  unanticipated  changes in
     consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors, which may
     result in  cancellations  of advance  orders or a reduction  in the rate of
     reorders  placed  by  customers  and/or  continued  weakening  of  economic
     conditions.  Additionally,  management's estimates of future product demand
     may be  inaccurate,  which could  result in an  understated  or  overstated
     provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.

     Income  Taxes - Current  income tax  expense is the amount of income  taxes
     expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or
     liability is established for the expected future  consequences of temporary
     differences  in the  financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and
     liabilities.  The Company  considers  future  taxable  income and  ongoing,
     prudent and feasible tax planning  strategies in assessing the value of its
     deferred tax assets. If the Company  determines that it is more likely than
     not that these  assets will not be  realized,  the Company  will reduce the
     value  of  these  assets  to  their  expected  realizable  value,   thereby
     decreasing net income.  Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily
     based on the Company's  judgment.  If the Company  subsequently  determined
     that the  deferred  tax  assets,  which  had been  written  down,  would be
     realized  in the  future,  the value of the  deferred  tax assets  would be
     increased,   thereby   increasing  net  income  in  the  period  when  that
     determination  was  made.  See Note 7 in Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
     Statements.

     Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

     In November 2002, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
FASB  Interpretation  No.  ("FIN") 45,  "Guarantor's  Accounting  and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees,  Including  Indirect  Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others," an  interpretation  SFAS Nos. 5, 57 and 107, and  rescission of FIN 34,
"Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 elaborates
on the  disclosures  to be made  by the  guarantor  in its  interim  and  annual
financial  statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued.  It also  requires  that a guarantor  recognize,  at the  inception of a
guarantee,  a  liability  for the fair  value of the  obligation  undertaken  in
issuing the guarantee.  The initial  recognition and  measurement  provisions of
this  interpretation  are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued
or modified  after  December 31, 2002,  while the  provisions of the  disclosure
requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods
ending after  December  15, 2002.  The Company  adopted such  interpretation  on
November  1,  2002  with  no  material  impact  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements.

     In January  2003,  the FASB  issued FIN 46(R),  "Consolidation  of Variable
Interest  Entities,"  an  interpretation  of ARB No. 51, and revised in December
2003. FIN 46(R) requires certain variable  interest  entities to be consolidated
by the primary  beneficiary of the entity if the equity  investors in the entity
do not have the  characteristics  of a controlling  financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities  without
additional  subordinated  financial  support  from other  parties.  FIN 46(R) is
effective  for all new  variable  interest  entities  created or acquired  after
December 31, 2003. For variable  interest  entities created or acquired prior to
December 31,  2003,  the  provisions  of FIN 46(R) must be applied for the first
interim or annual period  beginning  after March 15, 2004.  The Company does not
expect  that the  adoption  of FIN  46(R)  will  have a  material  impact on its
consolidated  financial  position,  results of operations or cash flows,  as the
Company has no interests in variable interest entities.



     In May  2003,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS No.  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain
Instruments with  Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity," as amended by
various  FASB  staff  positions  posted in  October  and  November  2003,  which
establishes  standards  for  how  an  issuer  classifies  and  measures  certain
financial  instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS
No. 150 requires that an issuer  classify a financial  instrument that is within
its scope which may have previously been reported as equity,  as a liability (or
an asset in some  circumstances).  This  statement  is effective  for  financial
instruments  entered  into or  modified  after  May 31,  2003 and  otherwise  is
generally effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15,  2003,  except for  mandatorily  redeemable  financial  instruments  of
nonpublic entities, which are subject to the provision of this statement for the
first fiscal  period  beginning  after  December 15, 2004.  The Company does not
believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have a significant  impact on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Sales

     The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales
for the past five years.  Data from any one or more quarters is not  necessarily
indicative of annual results or continuing trends.

     Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means a
unit of  measurement  equal to 192 U.S.  fluid  ounces of finished  beverage (24
eight-ounce  servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces
of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases
(or unit case  equivalents)  of  beverages  directly or  indirectly  sold by the
Company. Sales of food bars and cereals are expressed in actual cases. A case of
food bars and cereals is defined as follows:

o    A fruit and grain  bar and  functional  nutrition  bar case  equals  ninety
     1.76-ounce bars.
o    A natural cereal case equals ten 13-ounce boxes measured by volume.
o    An active nutrition bar case equals thirty-two 1.4-ounce bars.

     The Company's  quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that
are primarily  the result of increased  demand in the warmer months of the year.
It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first
and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.  Because the primary  historical market
for Hansen's products is California,  which has a year-long  temperate  climate,
the  effect  of  seasonal  fluctuations  on  quarterly  results  may  have  been
mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution
of Hansen's  products  expands  outside of  California.  The Company has not had
sufficient experience with many its newer product introductions and consequently
has no  knowledge of the trends  which may occur with such  products.  Quarterly
fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of
new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more
pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of
the sales of its finished products,  soda concentrates and increased advertising
and promotional expenses. See also "ITEM 1. BUSINESS - SEASONALITY."

Inflation

     The Company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations for the periods presented.

Forward Looking Statements

     The Private Security  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a
safe harbor for forward looking  statements made by or on behalf of the Company.
The Company and its  representatives  may from time to time make written or oral
forward looking statements,  including  statements  contained in this report and
other  filings with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  and in reports to
shareholders  and  announcements.  Certain  statements  made in this  report may
constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the
Securities Act 1933, as amended, and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended)  regarding the  expectations  of management with respect to
revenues,  profitability,  adequacy of funds from  operations  and our  existing
credit  facility,  among other things.  All statements  which address  operating
performance,  events or developments that management expects or anticipates will
or may occur in the future including statements related to new products,  volume
growth, revenues,  profitability,  adequacy of funds from operations, and/or the
Company's  existing  credit  facility,  earnings  per share  growth,  statements
expressing  general optimism about future operating  results and  non-historical
information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act.

     These  statements  are qualified by their terms and/or  important  factors,
many of which are outside our control, involve a number of risks,  uncertainties
and  other  factors,  that  could  cause  actual  results  and  events to differ
materially  from  the  statements  made  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the
following:

     o    Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital
          expansion plans and general operating activities;

     o    Decreased  demand for our products  resulting from changes in consumer
          preferences;

     o    Changes in demand  that are  weather  related,  particularly  in areas
          outside of California;

     o    Competitive  products and pricing  pressures and the Company's ability
          to gain or maintain its share of sales in the  marketplace as a result
          of actions by competitors;



     o    The introduction of new products;

     o    An inability to achieve  volume growth  through  product and packaging
          initiatives;

     o    Laws and regulations, and/or any changes therein, including changes in
          accounting  standards,   taxation  requirements  (including  tax  rate
          changes,  new  tax  laws  and  revised  tax law  interpretations)  and
          environmental  laws as well as the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act,
          the Dietary  Supplement Health and Education Act, and regulations made
          thereunder or in connection therewith, as well as changes in any other
          food and drug laws,  especially those that may affect the way in which
          the  Company's  products  are  marketed  and/or  labeled  and/or sold,
          including the contents  thereof,  as well as laws and  regulations  or
          rules made or enforced by the Food and Drug Administration  and/or the
          Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and  Firearms,   and/or  Federal  Trade
          Commission, and/or certain state regulatory agencies;

     o    Changes in the cost and  availability of raw materials and the ability
          to  maintain  favorable  supply  arrangements  and  relationships  and
          procure  timely  and/or  adequate  production  of  all  or  any of the
          Company's products;

     o    The  Company's  ability to achieve  earnings  forecasts,  which may be
          based on projected  volumes and sales of many product types and/or new
          products,  certain of which are more profitable than others. There can
          be no  assurance  that the Company will  achieve  projected  levels or
          mixes of product sales;

     o    The Company's ability to penetrate new markets;

     o    The marketing efforts of distributors of the Company's products,  most
          of which distribute products that are competitive with the products of
          the Company;

     o    Unilateral decisions by distributors,  grocery chains, specialty chain
          stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or
          any of the Company's products that they are carrying at any time;

     o    The terms and/or availability of the Company's credit facility and the
          actions of its creditors;

     o    The  effectiveness  of  the  Company's   advertising,   marketing  and
          promotional programs;

     o    Changes in product category consumption;

     o    Unforeseen economic and political changes;

     o    Possible recalls of the Company's products; and

     o    The Company's ability to make suitable arrangements for the co-packing
          of any of its products  including,  but not limited to, its energy and
          functional drinks in 8.3-ounce slim cans and 16-ounce cans,  smoothies
          in  11.5-ounce  cans,  E2O  Energy  Water(R),   Energade(R),   Monster
          Energy(R)  and  Lost(R)  energy  drinks,   soy  smoothies,   sparkling
          orangeades and lemonades in glass bottles and other products.

     The foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive.

     Our actual results could be materially different from the results described
or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty
of  estimates,  forecasts  and  projections  and may be  better  or  worse  than
anticipated.  Given these uncertainties,  you should not rely on forward-looking
statements.  Forward-looking  statements represent our estimates and assumptions
only as of the date that they  were  made.  We  expressly  disclaim  any duty to
provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions
associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes
in  circumstances  or  expectations  or the occurrence of  unanticipated  events
except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.



ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

     In the normal  course of  business,  our  financial  position is  routinely
subject to a variety of risks.  The  principal  market risks (i.e.,  the risk of
loss arising from adverse  changes in market rates and prices) which the Company
is exposed to are  fluctuations  in commodity  prices  affecting the cost of raw
materials and changes in interest  rates of the Company's long term debt. We are
also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our
ability to recover  increased  costs  through  higher  pricing is limited by the
competitive  environment in which we operate. We are also subject to other risks
associated  with the business  environment  in which we operate,  including  the
collectability of accounts receivable.

     At December 31, 2003, the majority of the Company's debt consisted of fixed
rather than  variable  rate debt.  The amount of variable  rate debt  fluctuates
during the year based on the Company's cash  requirements.  If average  interest
rates were to increase one percent for the year ended December 31, 2003, the net
impact on the Company's pre-tax earnings would have been insignificant.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

     The  information  required to be furnished in response to this Item follows
the signature page hereto at pages 55 through 75.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES  IN  AND  DISAGREEMENTS  WITH  ACCOUNTANTS  ON  ACCOUNTING  AND
     FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

     None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     Under  the  supervision  and  with  the   participation  of  the  Company's
management,  including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial  Officer,
we  have  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of our
disclosure  controls and  procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report.  Based  upon this  evaluation,  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and Chief
Financial  Officer have  concluded  that the Company's  disclosure  controls and
procedures are adequate and effective to ensure that material information we are
required  to  disclose in reports  that we file or submit  under the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,  summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.

     There have been no significant  changes in internal  control over financial
reporting  that occurred  during the fiscal  period  covered by this report that
have materially  affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially  affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

$1,000 for each meeting of the Board of Directors  attended.  Outside  directors
were also  entitled to $500 for each  committee  meeting  attended in person and
$250 for each committee meeting attended by telephone.

Compensation  Committee  Interlocks and Insider  Participation  in  Compensation
Decisions

     The  Company's  Compensation  Committee is composed of Mr.  Epstein and Mr.
Vindergauz.  No  interlocking  relationships  exist  between  any  member of the
Company's  Board of Directors or  Compensation  Committee  and any member of the
board of directors or compensation  committee of any other company,  nor has any
such  interlocking   relationship   existed  in  the  past.  No  member  of  the
Compensation  Committee  is or was  formerly  an officer or an  employee  of the
Company.

Employee Stock Option Plan

     The Company has a stock  option plan (the  "Plan")  that  provided  for the
grant of options to purchase up to  3,000,000  shares of the common stock of the
Company to certain key  employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries.  Options
granted  under the Plan may either be incentive  stock options  qualified  under
Section 422 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  or non-qualified
options.  Such options are exercisable at fair market value on the date of grant
for a period of up to ten years.  Under the Plan,  shares subject to options may
be purchased for cash, or for shares of common stock valued at fair market value
on the date of purchase.  Under the Plan, no  additional  options may be granted
after July 1, 2001.

     During 2001, the Company adopted the Hansen Natural  Corporation 2001 Stock
Option Plan ("2001 Option Plan"). The 2001 Option Plan provides for the grant of
options to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company to
certain key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options granted under
the 2001 Stock Option Plan may be incentive  stock  options under Section 422 of
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),  nonqualified stock options,
or stock appreciation rights.

     The Plan and the 2001  Option  Plan are  administered  by the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company,  comprised of directors  who
satisfy  the  "non-employee"  director  requirements  of Rule  16b-3  under  the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and the "outside director" provision of Section
162(m) of the Code.  Grants  under  the Plan and the 2001  Option  Plan are made
pursuant to  individual  agreements  between the Company and each  grantee  that
specifies the terms of the grant, including the exercise price, exercise period,
vesting and other terms thereof.

Outside Directors Stock Option Plan

     The Company has an option plan for its outside  directors  (the  "Directors
Plan") that  provides for the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of
100,000  shares of common  stock of the Company to  directors of the Company who
are not and have not been employed by or acted as consultants to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  or affiliates  and who are not and have not been nominated to
the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to a contractual arrangement.  On
the date of the annual meeting of stockholders at which an eligible  director is
initially  elected,  each  eligible  director  is entitled to receive a one-time
grant of an option to purchase  6,000 shares  (12,000  shares if the director is
serving on a committee of the Board) of the Company's  Common Stock  exercisable
at the closing  price for a share of common stock on the date of grant.  Options
become exercisable  one-third each on the first, second and third anniversary of
the date of grant; provided that all options held by an eligible director become
fully and  immediately  exercisable  upon a change in  control  of the  Company.
Options granted under the Directors Plan that are not exercised generally expire
ten years after the date of grant. Option grants may be made under the Directors
Plan for ten years from the effective date of the Directors  Plan. The Directors
Plan is a "formula plan" so that a non-employee director's  participation in the
Directors  Plan does not  affect  his  status as a  "disinterested  person"  (as
defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Hansen Natural Corporation
Corona, California



We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Hansen Natural
Corporation and  subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the years ended  December  31,  2003,  2002 and 2001.  Our audits also
included  the  financial   statement   schedule  listed  in  Item  15(b).  These
consolidated  financial statements and this financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated  financial statements and this financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of Hansen Natural  Corporation  and
subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  2003  and  2002,  and the  results  of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002 and
2001 in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  presents  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other  intangible  assets as a
result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill
and Other  Intangible  Assets,  effective  January 1, 2002. As also discussed in
Note 1, effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the consensus in Emerging
Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01-9,  "Accounting for Consideration  Given
by a Vendor to a  Customer  (Including  a  Reseller  of a  Vendor's  Products),"
resulting in the  presentation of certain sales promotion  expenses and customer
allowances as a reduction of net sales and increase of cost of sales rather than
operating  expenses.  The consolidated  financial  statements for the year ended
December 31, 2001 have been revised to reclassify  such expenses and  allowances
as a reduction  of net sales and increase of cost of sales  consistent  with the
2003 and 2002 presentation, in accordance with EITF 01-9.

1.       ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Organization - Hansen Natural  Corporation  (the "Company" or "Hansen") was
incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1990. The Company is a holding company and
has no operating business except through its direct  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,
Hansen Beverage  Company  ("HBC") which was  incorporated in Delaware on June 8,
1992 and Hard e Beverage  Company ("HEB") formerly known as Hard Energy Company,
and previously  known as CVI Ventures,  Inc., which was incorporated in Delaware
on April 30, 1990.  HBC conducts the vast  majority of the  Company's  operating
business and generates  substantially all of the Company's  operating  revenues.
References  herein  to  "Hansen"  or the  "Company"  when used to  describe  the
operating  business of the Company are  references to the business of HBC unless
otherwise  indicated,  and  references  herein to HEB when used to describe  the
operating  business of HEB, are  references to the Hard e brand  business of HEB
unless otherwise indicated.

     In addition, HBC, through its wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  Blue Sky Natural
Beverage Co. ("Blue Sky") and Hansen Junior Juice Company  ("Junior Juice") owns
and operates the natural soda business  under the Blue Sky(R)  trademark and the
Junior Juice beverage business under the Junior Juice trademarks, respectively.

     Nature of Operations -- Hansen markets and distributes  Hansen's(R) Natural
Sodas,   Signature  Sodas,  fruit  juice  and  soy  Smoothies,   Energy  drinks,
Energade(R)  energy  sports  drinks,  E20 Energy  Water(R),  functional  drinks,
Sparkling  Lemonades  and  Orangeades,  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks in  aseptic
packaging,  Junior Juice(R)  juice,  iced teas,  lemonades and juice  cocktails,
apple juice,  cider and juice  blends,  as well as nutrition  bars,  Blue Sky(R)
brand  carbonated  beverages,  Monster  EnergyTM brand energy drinks and Lost(R)
Energy  brand  energy  drinks.  The  Company's  subsidiary,   HEB,  markets  and
distributes Hard e malt beverages.

     Basis of Presentation - The accompanying  consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States of America ("generally accepted accounting principles").

     Principles  of  Consolidation  - The  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements  include the  accounts of Hansen and its wholly  owned  subsidiaries,
HBC,  HEB,  Blue  Sky  and  Junior  Juice  since  their   respective   dates  of
incorporation.  All intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

     Reclassifications  -  Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made  in  the
consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2003 presentation.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company  considers  certificates of deposit
with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash  and  cash
equivalents.  The Company  maintains  cash  deposits with major banks which from
time to time may exceed  federally  insured  limits.  The  Company  periodically
assesses the financial  condition of the institutions and believes that the risk
of any loss is minimal.

     Inventories  - Inventories  are valued at the lower of first-in,  first-out
(FIFO) cost or market value (net realizable value).



     Property  and  Equipment  -  Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost.
Depreciation of furniture, office equipment,  equipment and vehicles is based on
their  estimated  useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated  using the
straight-line  method.  Amortization  of leasehold  improvements is based on the
lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is
calculated using the straight-line method.

     Trademark  License  and  Trademarks  -  Trademark  license  and  trademarks
represents the Company's  exclusive  ownership of the  Hansen's(R)  trademark in
connection with the  manufacture,  sale and  distribution of beverages and water
and non-beverage  products.  The Company also owns in its own right, a number of
other trademarks in the United States as well as in a number of countries around
the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky(R)  trademark,  which was acquired
in September 2000, and the Junior Juice(R) trademark,  which was acquired in May
2001. The Company  amortizes its trademark  license and trademarks  over 1 to 25
years. Upon the adoption of Statement of Financial  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 142,
the Company ceased the amortization of indefinite life assets.

     Long-Lived Assets - Management regularly reviews property and equipment and
other  long-lived  assets,  including  certain  identifiable  intangibles,   for
possible impairment.  This review occurs annually,  or more frequently if events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable.  If there is  indication of impairment of property and equipment or
amortizable  intangible assets,  then management  prepares an estimate of future
cash flows  (undiscounted  and without interest charges) expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If these cash flows are less
than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write
down the asset to its estimated  fair value.  The fair value is estimated at the
present value of the future cash flows  discounted at a rate  commensurate  with
management's  estimates of the business risks. Annually, or earlier, if there is
indication  of  impairment  of  identified  intangible  assets  not  subject  to
amortization,  management  compares the  estimated  fair value with the carrying
amount  of the  asset.  An  impairment  loss is  recognized  to  write  down the
intangible  asset to its  fair  value if it is less  than the  carrying  amount.
Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and
is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future
conditions. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2003.

     Revenue  Recognition - The Company  records revenue at the time the related
products are shipped and the risk of ownership has passed.  Management  believes
an adequate  provision  against net sales has been made for  estimated  returns,
allowances and cash discounts based on the Company's historical experience.

     Freight  Costs and  Reimbursement  of Freight  Costs - In  accordance  with
Emerging  Issues Task Force  ("EITF") No.  00-10,  "Accounting  for Shipping and
Handling Fees and Costs,"  reimbursements of freight charges are recorded in net
sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For the years ended
December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001,  freight-out  costs amounted to $7.0 million,
$5.8 million and $4.2 million,  respectively, and have been recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the accompanying  consolidated statements
of income.

     Advertising  and  Promotional   Allowances  -  The  Company   accounts  for
advertising  production  costs by expensing such production costs the first time
the related  advertising  takes  place.  Advertising  expenses  amounted to $8.8
million,  $7.3 million and $4.3  million for the years ended  December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001,  respectively.  Advertising  expenses  were  included in selling,
general and administrative  expenses with the exception of coupon expenses which
were included as a reduction of net sales. In addition, the Company supports its
customers,  including distributors,  with promotional  allowances,  a portion of
which  is  utilized  for  marketing  and  indirect  advertising  by  them.  Such
promotional  allowances  amounted  to $17.2  million,  $13.5  million  and $12.2
million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.



     Change  in  Accounting  for  Promotional  Allowances  - Prior to 2002,  the
Company   included  its   promotional   allowances   in  selling,   general  and
administrative  expenses.  Effective  the first  quarter  of 2002,  the  Company
adopted the consensus of the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's  ("FASB")
EITF No. 01-9,  "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or
a Reseller of the Vendor's  Products," which addresses various issues related to
the income statement  classification of certain promotional payments,  including
consideration  from a vendor to a reseller or another  party that  purchases the
vendor's  products.  EITF No.  01-9 was  issued in  November  2001 and  codified
earlier  pronouncements.  The consensus  requires  certain sales  promotions and
customer allowances previously classified as selling, general and administrative
expenses to be  classified as a reduction of net sales or as cost of goods sold.
The Company  adopted EITF No. 01-9 on January 1, 2002.  The effect of the change
in  accounting  related  to the  adoption  of EITF No.  01-9 for the year  ended
December 31, 2003 was to decrease  net sales by  $19,452,566,  increase  cost of
goods sold by $80,530 and decrease selling, general, and administrative expenses
by  $19,533,096  and for the year ended  December  31, 2002 was to decrease  net
sales by  $14,846,875,  increase  cost of goods sold by  $220,394  and  decrease
selling,  general and administrative  expenses by $15,067,269.  The consolidated
financial  statements  for the year ended December 31, 2001 have been revised to
reclassify such expenses and allowances as a reduction of net sales and increase
of cost of sales in accordance  with EITF 01-9.  For the year ended December 31,
2001, $11,621,396 has been reclassified as a reduction to net sales and $341,332
as an  increase  in cost of sales,  both of which were  previously  reported  as
selling, general and administrative expenses.

     Income Taxes - The Company  accounts for income taxes under the  provisions
of SFAS No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes." This  statement  requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  for the future  consequences
of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax
returns.  Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the
event the future  consequences of differences  between financial reporting bases
and tax bases of the Company's  assets and liabilities  result in a deferred tax
asset,  SFAS No. 109 requires an evaluation of the  probability of being able to
realize  the future  benefits  indicated  by such asset.  A valuation  allowance
related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

     Stock-Based  Compensation - The Company accounts for its stock option plans
in  accordance  with  Accounting   Principles  Board  ("APB")  Opinion  No.  25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related  Interpretations.  Under
APB Opinion No. 25, no compensation  expense is recognized  because the exercise
price of the Company's  employee  stock  options  equals the market price of the
underlying  stock at the date of the grant.  In December  2002,  the FASB issued
SFAS  No.  148,   "Accounting   for  Stock-Based   Compensation-Transition   and
Disclosure."  SFAS No. 148  amends  SFAS No.  123,  Accounting  for  Stock-based
Compensation,  and is effective immediately upon issuance. SFAS No. 148 provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based  employee  compensation as well as amending
the  disclosure  requirements  of SFAS No.  123 to  require  interim  and annual
disclosures about the method of accounting for stock-based  compensation and the
effect  of the  method  used  on  reported  results.  The  Company  follows  the
requirements of APB Opinion No. 25 and the disclosure-only provision of SFAS No.
123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. Had compensation  cost for the Company's option
plans  been  determined  based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in
the years 2001 through 2003  consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
Company's  net income and net income per common share would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts indicated below:

     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using

     Net Income Per Common Share - In  accordance  with SFAS No. 128,  "Earnings
per  Share,"  net income per common  share,  on a basic and  diluted  basis,  is
presented  for all  periods.  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted
net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted  average
number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding, if dilutive.
Weighted average common equivalent shares include stock options and purchases of
the Company's common stock, held in treasury, using the treasury stock method.

     Concentration  Risk - Certain of the Company's  products utilize components
(raw materials and/or co-packing  services) from a limited number of sources.  A
disruption  in the  supply of such  components  could  significantly  affect the
Company's  revenues  from  those  products,   as  alternative  sources  of  such
components  may not be available at  commercially  reasonable  rates or within a
reasonably short time period.  The Company continues to take steps on an ongoing
basis to secure the availability of alternative  sources for such components and
minimize the risk of any disruption in production.

     One customer  accounted for approximately 15%, 18% and 18% of the Company's
sales for the years ended  December 31,  2003,  2002 and 2001,  respectively.  A
decision by that, or any other major customer,  to decrease the amount purchased
from the  Company  or to cease  carrying  the  Company's  products  could have a
material  adverse effect on the Company's  financial  condition and consolidated
results of operations.

     During 2003, 2002 and 2001,  sales outside of California  represented  47%,
42% and 39% of the aggregate sales of the Company, respectively.

     Credit Risk - The  Company  sells its  products  nationally,  primarily  to
retailers  and  beverage  distributors.  The  Company  performs  ongoing  credit
evaluations  of its  customers and generally  does not require  collateral.  The
Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses,  and historically,  such
losses have been within management's expectations.



     Fair Value of Financial  Instruments  - At December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the
carrying values of cash,  accounts  receivable and accounts payable  approximate
fair  value  because  of the  short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.
Long-term debt bears interest at a rate comparable to the prime rate; therefore,
management  believes  the  carrying  amount for the  outstanding  borrowings  at
December 31, 2003 approximates fair value.

     Use of Estimates - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Segment Information - The Company's operating segments have been aggregated
into one reportable segment due to similarities of the economic  characteristics
and nature of  operations  among the  operations  represented  by the  Company's
various product lines.

     Change in Accounting for Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets - Effective
January 1, 2002, the Company  adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill
and Other  Intangible  Assets." This statement  discontinued the amortization of
goodwill and indefinite-lived  intangible assets, subject to periodic impairment
testing.  Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company  evaluated the useful lives
of its various  trademark  licenses and trademarks and concluded that certain of
the  trademark  licenses  and  trademarks  have  indefinite  lives.  Unamortized
trademark  licenses and trademarks  deemed to have indefinite lives ceased to be
amortized  effective  January  1,  2002 and are  subject  to  annual  impairment
analysis. Had the non-amortization  provision of SFAS No. 142 been adopted as of
January  1,  2001,  net  income  and net  income  per share for the years  ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 would have been adjusted as follows:

     Upon  adoption  of SFAS No. 142 and as of December  31, 2002 and 2003,  the
trademark  licenses and trademarks were tested for impairment in accordance with
the  provisions  of SFAS  No.  142.  Fair  values  were  estimated  based on the
Company's best estimate of the expected  present value of future cash flows.  No
amounts were impaired at those times. In addition, the remaining useful lives of
trademark licenses and trademarks being amortized were reviewed and deemed to be
appropriate.  The  following  provides  additional  information  concerning  the
Company's trademark licenses and trademarks as of December 31:

     All  amortizing  trademark  licenses and  trademarks  have been assigned an
estimated  finite useful life, and are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over
the number of years that approximate  their respective useful lives ranging from
1 to 25 years (weighted average life of 19 years).  The straight-line  method of
amortization  allocates  the cost of the  trademark  licenses and  trademarks to
earnings  in  proportion  to the amount of  economic  benefits  obtained  by the
Company in that report period.  Total amortization expense during the year ended
December  31,  2003 was  $61,888.  As of December  31,  2003,  future  estimated
amortization  expense  related to amortizing  trademark  licenses and trademarks
through the year ended December 31, 2008 is:

     Newly Issued Accounting  Pronouncements - In November 2002, the FASB issued
FASB  Interpretation  No.  ("FIN") 45,  "Guarantor's  Accounting  and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees,  Including  Indirect  Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others," an  interpretation  SFAS Nos. 5, 57 and 107, and  rescission of FIN 34,
"Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 elaborates
on the  disclosures  to be made  by the  guarantor  in its  interim  and  annual
financial  statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued.  It also  requires  that a guarantor  recognize,  at the  inception of a
guarantee,  a  liability  for the fair  value of the  obligation  undertaken  in
issuing the guarantee.  The initial  recognition and  measurement  provisions of
this  interpretation  are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued
or modified  after  December 31, 2002,  while the  provisions of the  disclosure
requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods
ending after  December  15, 2002.  The Company  adopted such  interpretation  on
November  1,  2002  with  no  material  impact  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements.

     In January  2003,  the FASB  issued FIN 46(R),  "Consolidation  of Variable
Interest  Entities-an  interpretation  of ARB No.  51," and  revised in December
2003. FIN 46(R) requires certain variable  interest  entities to be consolidated
by the primary  beneficiary of the entity if the equity  investors in the entity
do not have the  characteristics  of a controlling  financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities  without
additional  subordinated  financial  support  from other  parties.  FIN 46(R) is
effective  for all new  variable  interest  entities  created or acquired  after
December 31, 2003. For variable  interest  entities created or acquired prior to
December 31,  2003,  the  provisions  of FIN 46(R) must be applied for the first
interim or annual period  beginning  after March 15, 2004.  The Company does not
expect  that the  adoption  of FIN  46(R)  will  have a  material  impact on its
consolidated  financial  position,  results of operations or cash flows,  as the
Company has no interests in variable interest entities.



     In May  2003,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS No.  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain
Instruments with  Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity," as amended by
various  FASB  staff  positions  posted in  October  and  November  2003,  which
establishes  standards  for  how  an  issuer  classifies  and  measures  certain
financial  instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS
No. 150 requires that an issuer  classify a financial  instrument that is within
its scope which may have previously been reported as equity,  as a liability (or
an asset in some  circumstances).  This  statement  is effective  for  financial
instruments  entered  into or  modified  after  May 31,  2003 and  otherwise  is
generally effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15,  2003,  except for  mandatorily  redeemable  financial  instruments  of
nonpublic entities, which are subject to the provision of this statement for the
first fiscal  period  beginning  after  December 15, 2004.  The Company does not
believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have a significant  impact on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 2.       ACQUISITIONS

     On May 25, 2001, the Company acquired, through its subsidiary Junior Juice,
the Junior Juice beverage business of Pasco Juices,  Inc.,  including the Junior
Juice(R)  trademarks and assumption of certain  liabilities for a purchase price
of $946,677.  The Junior Juice(R) products are comprised of 100% juices targeted
at toddlers.

     The  acquisition  has been  accounted  for  under  the  purchase  method of
accounting  in  accordance  with APB  Opinion No. 16,  "Business  Combinations."
Accordingly,  the purchase price,  inclusive of certain  acquisition  costs, was
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on a valuation of
their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.  The purchase price for
the  acquisition  of Junior Juice was financed by the issuance of a note payable
to Pasco  Juice,  Inc.,  payable over five years and the  assumption  of certain
liabilities (Note 5).

     Trademarks acquired are evaluated and amortized in accordance with SFAS No.
142. The  operating  results of Junior Juice have been included in the Company's
results of operations since the date of acquisition.

5.   LONG-TERM DEBT

     HBC has a  credit  facility  from  Comerica  Bank-California  ("Comerica"),
consisting of a revolving line of credit and a term loan. Such revolving line of
credit  and term  loan  were  secured  by  substantially  all of  HBC's  assets,
including accounts  receivable,  inventory,  trademarks,  trademark licenses and
certain equipment. In accordance with the provisions of the credit facility, HBC
can borrow up to $12.0 million under its revolving  line of credit,  reducing to
$6.0 million by September  2004.  The revolving  line of credit  remains in full
force and effect through  September 2005.  Interest on borrowings under the line
of  credit  is  based  on the  bank's  base  (prime)  rate,  plus an  additional
percentage of up to 0.5% or the LIBOR rate, plus an additional  percentage of up
to 2.5%, depending upon certain financial ratios of the Company. The Company had
no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit at December 31, 2003.

     The  terms  of the  Company's  line of  credit  contain  certain  financial
covenants including certain financial ratios and annual net income requirements.
The line of credit contains  provisions  under which  applicable  interest rates
will be adjusted in increments  based on the  achievement  of certain  financial
ratios.  The Company was in compliance with its financial  ratios and annual net
income  requirements  and  obtained a waiver from  Comerica  with regards to its
capital expenditure limitations at December 31, 2003.

     During 2000,  the Company  entered into capital  leases for  acquisition of
certain  vehicles,  payable  over a  five-year  period and  having an  effective
interest rate of 8.8%. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the assets  acquired under
capital leases had a net book value of $121,178 and $285,085, net of accumulated
depreciation of $418,465 and $301,422, respectively.

    Long-term debt consists of the following

6.       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Operating Leases - The Company leases its warehouse  facility and corporate
offices under a 10 year lease  beginning  October  2000,  when the Company first
occupied  the  facility.  The  facility  lease and certain  equipment  and other
noncancelable  operating  leases  expire  through 2010.  The facility  lease has
scheduled rent increases which are accounted for on a straight-line  basis. Rent
expense under such leases amounted to $660,616,  $643,827,  and $644,454 for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In January 2004, the
Company entered into a lease for additional  warehouse space. This lease expires
in March 2008 with an option to renew through 2010.

     Future  minimum  rental  payments  at  December  31,  2003 under the leases
referred to above are as follows:

        Year ending December 31:
        2004                                              $       893,359
        2005                                                      970,359
        2006                                                    1,017,128

                                                         ==================

     Purchase  Commitments  - The Company has purchase  commitments  aggregating
approximately  $22,711,000,  which represent commitments made by the Company and
its subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the manufacturing and
packaging of its products. These obligations vary in terms.

     Advertising  Commitment - In March 2003,  HBC entered  into an  advertising
display  agreement  ("Monorail  Agreement")  with the Las Vegas Monorail Company
("LVMC") in terms of which HBC was granted the right,  in  consideration  of the
payment by HBC to LVMC of the sum of $1,000,000 per year, payable quarterly,  to
advertise and promote its products on a designated four car monorail  vehicle as
well as the right to sell certain of its  products on all monorail  stations for
payment of additional consideration.

     It is  anticipated  that the initial  term will  commence in May 2004.  The
initial  term of the Monorail  Agreement  ends on the first  anniversary  of its
commencement  date.  Not less than 120 days before the expiration of the initial
term and each renewal  term,  as the case may be, HBC has the right to renew the
Monorail  Agreement  for a  further  one  year  term  up to a  maximum  of  nine
additional  one year  terms  and the LVMC has the  right,  notwithstanding  such
election by HBC, to terminate  the Monorail  Agreement at the  expiration of the
then current term.

     Employment and Consulting Agreements - On June 1, 2003, the Company entered
into an  employment  agreement  with  Rodney C. Sacks and  Hilton H.  Schlosberg
pursuant to which Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg render services to the Company as
its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  and its Vice Chairman,  President and
Chief Financial Officer, respectively. The agreements provide for an annual base
salary of $230,000 each for the 7 months ended December 31, 2003,  increasing to
$245,000 for the year ending December 31, 2004 and increasing by a minimum of 5%
for each subsequent  twelve-month  period during the employment period,  plus an
annual bonus in an amount determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors
of the Company as well as certain fringe benefits for the period commencing June
1, 2003 and ending December 31, 2008.

     Litigation  - The  Company  is  subject  to, and  involved  in,  claims and
contingencies  related to lawsuits and other  matters  arising out of the normal
course of  business.  The  ultimate  liability  associated  with such claims and
contingencies,  if any, is not likely to have a material  adverse  effect on the
financial condition of the Company.



     During 2002,  in response to a cease and desist  letter to Skyy Spirits LLC
in which the Company alleged infringement by Skyy Spirits and/or its licensee of
the  Company's  Blue Sky(R)  trademark,  Skyy  Spirits  filed a complaint in the
United  States  District  Court for the Northern  District of  California  for a
declaratory  order and  additional  relief.  The  Company  filed a  counterclaim
against Skyy Spirits and joined Miller  Brewing  Company in the  proceedings  in
which the Company has sought an  injunction  and claimed  damages,  including an
accounting for profits  earned by both Skyy Spirits and Miller Brewing  Company,
from the sale of the infringing  beverage products and further relief. The trial
in this matter has been scheduled for hearing in April 2004.

     During 2003,  in response to a cease and desist  letter from the  Coca-Cola
Company and its subsidiary Odwalla,  Inc. in which they complained of the use by
us of the  Monster  trademark  and name,  the Company  filed a complaint  in the
United  States  District  Court for the Southern  District of  California  for a
declaratory  order and additional  relief.  The Company is engaged in settlement
discussions  with the  Coca-Cola  Company and Odwalla,  Inc. If no settlement is
reached,  the Company will vigorously  pursue the matter.  The Company  believes
that it has good prospects of success.

     Guarantees  - The Company  from time to time enters into  certain  types of
contracts that  contingently  require the Company to indemnify  parties  against
third party claims.  These contracts primarily relate to: (i) certain agreements
with the Company's officers, directors and employees under which the Company may
be required to  indemnify  such  persons  for  liabilities  arising out of their
employment relationship,  (ii) certain distribution or purchase agreements under
which the Company may have to indemnify the Company's  customers from any claim,
liability  or loss  arising  out of any  actual or  alleged  injury  or  damages
suffered  in  connection  with the  consumption  or  purchase  of the  Company's
products,  and (iii) certain real estate leases,  under which the Company may be
required to indemnify  property  owners for liabilities and other claims arising
from the Company's use of the applicable premises.

     The terms of such obligations vary. Generally,  a maximum obligation is not
explicitly  stated.  Because the obligated  amounts of these types of agreements
often are not explicitly  stated,  the overall maximum amount of the obligations
cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the Company believes that its insurance
coverage  is  adequate to cover any  liabilities  or claims  arising out of such
instances referred to above. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to
make significant payments for these obligations and accordingly, the Company has
valued these obligations at $0 on its consolidated balance sheets as of December
31, 2003 and 2002.

8.       STOCK OPTIONS

     The Company has three stock option plans,  the Hansen  Natural  Corporation
2001 Stock Option Plan ("2001  Option  Plan"),  the  Employee  Stock Option Plan
(the "Plan") and the Outside Directors Stock Option Plan ("Directors Plan").

     During 2001,  the Company  adopted the 2001 Option Plan which  provides for
the grant of options to purchase up to  2,000,000  shares of the common stock of
the  Company to certain  key  employees  of the  Company  and its  subsidiaries.
Options  granted under the 2001 Option Plan may be incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),  nonqualified
stock options,  or stock appreciation  rights.  Stock options are exercisable at
such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of  Directors  of the Company up to a ten-year  period after their date of
grant.  As of December 31, 2003,  options to purchase  915,500  shares of Hansen
common stock had been granted under the 2001 Option Plan and options to purchase
1,084,500  shares of Hansen  common stock remain  available  for grant under the
2001 Option Plan.

     The Plan, as amended,  provided for the granting of options to purchase not
more than  3,000,000  shares  of Hansen  common  stock to key  employees  of the
Company and its subsidiaries through July 1, 2001. Stock options are exercisable
at such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation  Committee of
the Board of Directors  of the Company up to a ten-year  period after their date
of grant,  and no options may be granted  after July 1, 2001.  The option  price
will not be less than the fair market value at the date of grant. As of December
31, 2003,  options to purchase  2,095,700 shares of Hansen common stock had been
granted under the Plan, net of options that have expired.



     The  Directors  Plan  provides  for the grant of options to  purchase up to
100,000  shares of common  stock of the Company to  directors of the Company who
are not and have not been employed by or acted as consultants to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  or affiliates  and who are not and have not been nominated to
the Board of Directors of the Company (the  "Board")  pursuant to a  contractual
arrangement.  On the date of the  annual  meeting of  shareholders,  at which an
eligible  director is initially  elected,  each eligible director is entitled to
receive a one-time grant of an option to purchase 6,000 shares (12,000 shares if
the  director is serving on a committee  of the Board) of the  Company's  common
stock,  exercisable one-third each on the first, second and third anniversary of
the date of grant;  provided,  however,  that options granted as of February 14,
1995,  are  exercisable  66 2/3% on the date of grant and 100% on July 8,  1995;
provided,  further,  that all options held by an eligible  director become fully
and  immediately  exercisable  upon a change in control of the Company.  Options
granted under the Directors  Plan that are not  exercised  generally  expire ten
years  after the date of grant.  Option  grants may be made under the  Directors
Plan for ten years from the effective date of the Directors  Plan. The Directors
Plan is a "formula" plan so that a nonemployee director's  participation in the
