Corporate History

In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons started a business to
sell fresh non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles, California. This business
eventually became Hansen’s Juices, Inc., which subsequently became known
as The Fresh Juice Company of California, Inc. (“FJC”).  FJC retained the right to market and sell
fresh non-pasteurized juices under the Hansen trademark. In 1977, Tim Hansen,
one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a demand for shelf stable
pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods, Inc.
(“HFI”). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen’s Natural
Sodas®. The California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (“CCC”)
acquired certain assets of HFI, including the right to market the Hansen’s®
brand name, in 1990. In 1992, HBC acquired the Hansen’s® brand natural soda and
apple juice business from CCC. Under our ownership, the Hansen beverage
business has significantly expanded and includes a wide range of beverages
within the growing “alternative” beverage category, including in particular,
energy drinks. In 1999, we acquired all of FJC’s rights to manufacture, sell
and distribute fresh non-pasteurized juice products under the Hansen’s®
trademark together with certain additional rights. In 2000, HBC, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary Blue Sky, acquired the natural soda business previously
conducted by Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co., a New Mexico corporation, under the
Blue Sky® trademark. In 2001, HBC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Junior
Juice, acquired the Junior Juice business previously conducted by Pasco Juices, Inc.
under the Junior Juice® trademark.

Industry Overview

The “alternative” beverage category combines
non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single
serve juices and fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks,
energy drinks, sports drinks, and single-serve still water (flavored,
unflavored and enhanced) with “new age” beverages, including sodas that are
considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling beverages.
According to Beverage Marketing Corporation, domestic wholesale sales in 2009
for the “alternative” beverage category of the market are estimated at $29.9
billion representing a decline of approximately 1.0% over the estimated
domestic wholesale sales in 2008 of approximately $30.2 billion (revised from a
previously reported estimate of $26.0 billion).

Reportable
Segments

We
have two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”), whose
principal products comprise primarily energy drinks, and Warehouse (“Warehouse”),
whose principal products comprise primarily juice based and soda beverages. The
DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive
distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells
products primarily directly to retailers. 
Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to the DSD or
Warehouse segments specifically have been allocated to “Corporate &
Unallocated.”


Our DSD segment
represented 91.9%, 90.7% and 89.5% of our consolidated net sales for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our Warehouse
segment represented 8.1%, 9.3% and 10.5% of our consolidated net sales for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

For
financial information about our reporting segments and geographic areas, refer

Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report, incorporated
herein by reference.  For certain risks

Bottled Water -

Our
still water product was introduced in 1993 and is now sold in 0.5-liter plastic
bottles, primarily to the food service trade. Sales of this product line are
very limited.

During
2009, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our
distribution markets.  In particular, we
continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the
category generally described as the “alternative” beverage category, with
particular emphasis on energy type drinks.


Other
Products

We
continue to evaluate and, where considered appropriate, introduce additional
flavors and types of beverages to complement our existing product lines. We
will also evaluate, and may, where considered appropriate, introduce “functional”
foods/snack foods that utilize similar channels of distribution and/or are
complementary to our existing products and/or to which our brand names are able
to add value.

We also develop and supply, on a limited basis, selected beverages in
different formats to a limited number of customers with the objective of
solidifying and/or enhancing our relationship with those customers.

Manufacture and Distribution

We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource the
manufacturing process to third party bottlers and contract packers.

We purchase concentrates, juices, flavors, supplements, cans, bottles,
aseptic boxes, aseptic pouches, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other
ingredients for our beverage products from our suppliers, which are delivered
to our various third party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product,
the third party bottlers or packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients
and supplements for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into
Company-approved containers in accordance with our formulas. In the case of
sodas and other carbonated beverages, the bottler/packer adds carbonation to
the products as part of the production process.

Co-Packing Arrangements

We are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase of and
delivery to our third party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which
our beverage products are packaged.

All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party
bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under
separate arrangements with each party. The majority of our co-packaging
arrangements are on a month-to-month basis. 
However, certain of our co-packing arrangements are described below:

(a)

Our agreement with Gluek Brewing Company
(“Gluek”) pursuant to which Gluek packages certain of our energy drinks. This contract
continues until May 2010 and is automatically extended for additional
terms of one (1) year each, unless either party notifies the other in
writing at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the last day of the
then current term.

(b)

Our agreement with

Carolina
Beer & Beverage

(“Carolina”)
pursuant to which Carolina packages certain of our energy drinks. This contract
continues until April 2010 and is automatically extended for additional
periods of one (1) year each, unless either party notifies the other in
writing at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the last day of the
then current term.

(c)

Our agreement with Safeway, Inc. (“Safeway”)
pursuant to which Safeway packages certain of our energy drinks and Hansen’s
Natural Sodas®. This contract continues until March 2010 and is
automatically renewed annually thereafter, unless terminated by either party
upon six (6) months written notice.

(d)

Our agreement with Nor-Cal Beverage Co.,
Inc. (“Nor-Cal”) pursuant to which Nor-Cal packages certain of our Hansen’s
juices in PET plastic bottles. This contract continues until August 2010


and is automatically renewed for one (1) year
terms thereafter unless terminated by either party not less than ninety (90)
days before the end of the initial term or any renewal period.

(e)

Our agreement with Dairy Farmers of
America, Inc. (“DFA”) pursuant to which DFA packages certain of our energy
drinks. This contract continues until March 2010 and is automatically
renewed for consecutive one (1) year periods, subject to mutually
agreeable pricing, unless either party provides notice of cancellation at least
ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial term or subsequent extension
period. Further, either party may terminate this agreement at its sole
discretion at any time by providing the other party with one hundred eighty
(180) days prior written notification specifying the date of termination.

(f)

Our agreement with the American Bottling
Co. (“American”) pursuant to which American packages certain of our energy
drinks. This contract continues until March 2010 and is automatically

automatically renewable for consecutive one (1) year periods, subject to
mutually agreeable pricing, unless either party provides notice of cancellation
at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial term or subsequent
extension period.

In certain instances, equipment is purchased by us and
installed at the facilities of our co-packers to enable them to produce certain
of our products. In general, such equipment remains our property and is either
returned to us upon termination of the packing arrangements with such
co-packers or is amortized over a pre-determined number of cases that are to be
produced at the facilities concerned.

We pack certain products outside of the West Coast region to enable us
to produce products closer to the markets where they are sold and thereby
reduce freight costs. As distribution volumes increase in both our domestic and
international markets, we continue to secure additional packing arrangements
closer to such markets to further reduce freight costs.

Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise,
particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid
growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for
our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials
including, but not limited to PET/plastic bottles, aseptic boxes, cans, glass,
labels, flavors, juice concentrates, or supplement ingredients or certain
sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on
a short-term basis.

(See “Part I,
Item 1A – Risk Factors”)

.

Although our production arrangements are generally of short duration or
are terminable upon our request, we believe a short disruption or delay would
not significantly affect our revenues because alternative packing facilities in
the United States with adequate capacity can usually be obtained for many of
our products at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short
time period.


However, there are limited packing facilities in the
United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Europe with
adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for certain of our products,
including Monster Energy®, Nitrous

TM

Monster Energy®, X-Presso Monster

TM

-Hammer and Lost® Energy

TM

energy drinks, Rumba®, Samba and Tango energy juice
drinks, our Java Monster

TM

product line and our aseptic juice products. A
disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly
affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in
the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom or Europe, as
the case may be, with adequate capacity may not be available for such products
either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
period, if at all. Consequently, a disruption in production of such products
could affect our revenues. We continue to seek alternative and/or additional
co-packing facilities in the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the
United Kingdom and Europe with adequate capacity for the production of our
various products to minimize the risk of a disruption in production.

Distribution
Agreements

Certain of our
distribution agreements are described below:

(a)

During the second quarter of 2006, we
entered into the Monster Beverages Off-Premise Distribution Coordination
Agreement and the Allied Products Distribution Coordination Agreement (jointly,
the “Off-Premise Agreements”) with Anheuser-Busch, Inc., a Missouri
corporation (“AB”). Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select Anheuser-Busch
distributors (the “AB Distributors”) distribute and sell, in markets designated
by us, our Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

brands non-alcoholic energy drinks and Rumba®,
Samba and Tango brand energy juices, as well as additional products that may be
agreed between the parties.

(b)

During the first quarter of 2007, we
entered into the On-Premise Distribution Coordination Agreement (the “On-Premise
Agreement”) with AB. Under the On-Premise Agreement, AB manages and coordinates
the sale, distribution and merchandising of Monster Energy® energy drinks to
on-premise retailers including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories
approved by us.

(c)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
entered into the Monster Energy Distribution Coordination Agreement (the “TCCC
North American Coordination Agreement”) with The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”).
Pursuant to the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement, we have designated,
and in the future may designate, territories in which bottlers from TCCC’s
network of partially owned and independent bottlers, including Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.
(“CCE”), Coca-Cola Bottling Company (“CCBC”), CCBCC Operations, LLC (“Consolidated”),
United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC (“United”), and other TCCC independent
bottlers (collectively, the “TCCC North American Bottlers”) will distribute and
sell primarily our Monster Energy® beverages (the “Products”) in the United
States and Canada.

(d)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
entered into the Monster Energy Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to
which CCE was appointed to distribute, directly and through certain
sub-distributors, the Products in portions of twenty-four U.S. states (the “U.S.
Territories”). We may designate additional territories within reasonable
proximity to the U.S. Territories and CCE will use reasonable good faith
efforts to add the additional territories. During the fourth quarter of 2008,
we entered into the Monster Energy Canadian Distribution Agreement with CCBC,
pursuant to which CCBC has been appointed to distribute, directly and through
certain sub-distributors, the Products in Canada, with performance commencing
on January 1, 2009. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we
entered into distribution agreements with Consolidated, United and other TCCC
North American Bottlers for the distribution of the Products in various
territories within the United States.


(e)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
entered into the Monster Energy International Coordination Agreement (the “TCCC
International Coordination Agreement”) with TCCC. Pursuant to the TCCC
International Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may
designate, countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC distributors to
distribute and sell the Products.

(f)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
entered into the Monster Energy International Distribution Agreement and the
Monster Energy Belgium Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE
has been appointed to distribute directly, and through certain sub-distributors,
the Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and
Monaco.

(g)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
entered into a distribution agreement with Comercializadora Eloro, S.A., a
subsidiary of Grupo Jumex, for exclusive distribution throughout Mexico,
excluding the Baja and Sonora regions, of our Monster Energy® and Monster
Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks as well as select Java Monster

TM

product line
drinks. Distribution under this agreement commenced January 26, 2009.

(h)

During the second quarter of 2009, we
entered into a distribution agreement with Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd. for
exclusive distribution throughout Australia of certain of our Monster Energy®
energy drinks. Distribution under this agreement commenced in July 2009.

(i)

During the second quarter of 2006, we
entered into a distribution agreement with Cadbury Bebidas, S.A. de C.V. (“Cadbury
Bebidas”), for exclusive distribution by Cadbury Bebidas throughout Mexico,
excluding Baja California, of our Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

energy
products. In December 2008, this distributor was notified of the
termination of its distribution agreement on January 25, 2009.

Distribution levels vary by product and geographic location. Gross
sales outside the United States accounted for $168.0 million, $94.2 million and
$53.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The reclassification of a portion of our gross sales to certain
military customers to gross sales to customers within the United States from
gross sales to customers outside the United States resulted in a decrease in
gross sales outside the United States of $2.1 million and $1.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, over amounts
previously reported.

We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering
into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery
distributors with established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.
Many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture
and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage
products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products.

During 2009, we continued to expand distribution of our products in both
the domestic and international markets, and our Monster Energy® drinks are now
sold in more than 40 countries around the world. We expanded our sales force to
support and grow sales, primarily of our Monster Energy® drinks, our Java
Monster

TM

product line, our Monster Hitman Energy
Shooter

TM

’s, our Nitrous

TM

Monster Energy®
product line and our X-Presso Monster

TM

-Hammer
energy drink.

Our Blue Sky® products are sold primarily to the health food trade,
natural food chains and mainstream grocery store chains, through specialty
health food distributors.


Raw Materials and
Suppliers

The
principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are aluminum
cans, PET plastic bottles as well as juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk
and cream, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. Overall, the prices
of aluminum cans, PET plastic bottles, certain juice concentrates and milk and
cream decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008. In particular, prices of apple
concentrate decreased significantly. We have secured a major part of our 2010
supply of apple concentrate at prices below the overall prices incurred in
2009. Sugar prices were higher in 2009.

We purchase beverage flavors, concentrates, juices, supplements, cane
sugar, sucrose, sucralose and other sweeteners as well as other ingredients
from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.

Generally, raw materials utilized by us in our business are readily
available from numerous sources. However, certain raw materials are
manufactured by only one company.  We
purchase sucralose, which is used alone or in combination with Acesulfame-K in
our low-calorie products, flavors, vitamin blends and herbs from single
manufacturers. Additionally, certain of our cans are only manufactured by
single companies in the United States.

With regard to our Java Monster

TM

product line, the dairy industry is subject to
shortages and higher demand from time to time, which may result in higher prices.

With regard to our fruit juice and juice-drink products, the industry
is subject to variability of weather conditions, which may result in higher
prices and/or lower consumer demand for juices.

Generally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their
flavors.  Consequently, we do not have
the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our
concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these
flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. We have
identified alternative suppliers of many of the supplements contained in many
of our beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain fruits and fruit
juices, and supplements and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time
in the future be, experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay
production of certain of our products.

We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for
certain of our flavors and concentrates as well as to negotiate arrangements
with suppliers which would enable us to obtain access to certain concentrates
or flavor formulas in certain circumstances. We have been partially successful
in these endeavors. Additionally, in a limited number of cases, contractual
restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses
may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers and
manufacturers and/or distributors.

In connection with the development of new products and flavors,
independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense of product
development, thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at a relatively
low cost. We have historically developed and successfully introduced new
products, flavors and packaging for our products and intend to continue
developing and introducing additional new beverages and flavors.

Competition

The
beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are
pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing
campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a
relatively large number of companies, many of which have substantially greater
financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.


Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and
effective development and marketing of new, unique cutting edge products,
attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. We
also compete for distributors who will focus on the sale of our products ahead
of those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution and
secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the “alternative”,
energy, coffee and “functional” beverage categories could cause our products to
be unable to gain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results.

We have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the
energy drink and energy shot categories. A number of companies who market and
distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in larger volume packages, such as 16-
and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including Sobe, Snapple, Arizona and
Fuse, have added supplements to their products with a view to marketing their
products as “functional” or energy beverages or as having “functional”
benefits. We believe that many of those products contain lower levels of
supplements and principally deliver refreshment. In addition, many competitive
products are positioned differently from our energy or “functional” drinks. Our
smoothies and tea lines are positioned more closely against those products.

We compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum
marketing efforts by multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors,
many of which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and brands.
Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much
larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of
numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc.
(“PepsiCo”), The Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (the “DPS Group”),
Red Bull Gmbh, Kraft Foods, Inc., Nestle Beverage Company, Tree Top and
Ocean Spray. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local
in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those
carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.

Our natural sodas compete directly with traditional soda products
including those marketed by TCCC, PepsiCo and the DPS Group, as well as with
carbonated beverages marketed by smaller or primarily local companies such as
Jones Soda Co., Clearly Canadian Beverage Company, Crystal Geyser, J.M. Smucker
Company and with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store
chains, convenience store chains and club stores.

Our fruit juice smoothies compete directly with Kern’s, Jumex, Jugos
del Valle and Libby’s Nectars, and V8 Smoothies, as well as with single serve
juice products produced by many competitors. 
Such competitive products are packaged in glass and PET bottles ranging
from 8- to 48-ounces in size and in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans. The juice content
of such competitive products ranges from 1% to 100%.

Our apple and other juice products compete directly
with Tree Top, Mott’s, Martinelli’s, Welch’s, Ocean Spray, Tropicana, Minute
Maid, Langers, Apple and Eve, Seneca, Northland, Juicy Juice and also with
other brands of apple juice and juice blends, especially store brands.

Our energy drinks, including Hansen’s® energy, Diet
Red Energy®, Monster Energy®, Nitrous

TM

Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy

TM

and Rumba®, Samba and Tango
energy juice in 8.3-ounce and/or 15.5-ounce and/or 16-ounce and/or 24-ounce
and/or 32-ounce and/or 500ml and/or 550ml aluminum cans and/or 500ml glass
bottles, and our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter

TM

’s,
compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full Throttle, No Fear, Amp,
Adrenaline Rush, NOS, Venom, Redline, 180, Red Devil, Rip It, Vitaminenergy,
5-Hour Energy Shot, Stacker 2, Red Bull Energy Shot, Redline Energy Shot, NOS
Energy Shot, Rockstar Energy Shot, Full Throttle Quick Shot, Amp Energy Shot
and many other brands. TCCC and PepsiCo also market and/or distribute
additional products in that market segment such as Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew,
Mountain Dew MDX and Vault.


Our Java Monster

TM

product line and our X-Presso Monster

TM

-Hammer energy drink compete directly with Starbucks Frappuccino,
Starbucks Double Shot, Starbucks Double Shot Energy Plus Coffee and other
Starbucks coffee drinks, Rockstar Roasted, Caribou Coffee, Cinnabon coffee
drinks, Godiva dairy based drinks and Full Throttle Coffee.

Our Peace Tea

TM

product line competes directly with Arizona,
Lipton, Snapple, Nestea, Xing Tea and other tea brands.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our
efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and
product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at
events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull”
methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets
and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising,
in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks,
coolers and barrel coolers, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions,
endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling
and sponsorship of selected causes. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print,
radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons,
may also be used to promote our brands. 
Our extreme sports team endorsements include teams such as the Pro
Circuit – Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross
and Supercross teams, Robby Gordon Racing Team, Ken Block Rally Racing Team and
the Tech 3 Moto GP Team. Our individual athlete and/or personality endorsements
include extreme sports figures and athletes such as NASCAR Camping World Truck Series racer
Ricky Carmichael, World Champion Moto GP motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi,
World Champion Formula 1 racer Jensen Button, television personalities such as
Rob Dyrdek as well as many other athletes that compete in other extreme sports
related activities, particularly, the Winter and Summer X-Games, supercross,
motocross, freestyle motocross, endurocross, Moto GP racing, Formula 1 racing,
surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, BMX, mountain
biking, snowmobile freestyle, snowmobile racing, NASCAR racing, off-road truck
racing, rally racing, etc. Our event endorsements include a wide range of
events such as the Monster Energy® Supercross Series, the AMA Pro Motocross
Championship Series, the Vans Warped Tour, the Australian SuperX Supercross Series and
the Epicenter Music Festival.

We believe that one of the keys to success in the
beverage industry is differentiation, which entails making our products
visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We
review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical,
endeavor to make them better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of
our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and
identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to
reevaluate the same from time to time.

Where appropriate, we partner with retailers to assist our marketing
efforts. For example, while we retain responsibility for the marketing of the
Juice Slam® line of children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks, Costco has
undertaken partial responsibility for the marketing of the Juice Blast® line.

We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by
approximately 7.1% in 2009 compared to 2008. As of December 31, 2009, we
employed 1,141 employees in sales and marketing activities, of which 428 were
employed on a full-time basis.

Customers

Our
customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and
specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers,
convenience chains, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross
sales to our various customer types for the years ended


December 2009, 2008
and 2007 are reflected below. Such information reflects sales made by us
directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service
beverage distributors. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell
certain of our products to the customer types listed below. We do not have
complete details of the sales of our products by our full service distributors
to their respective customers and therefore limit our description of our
customer types to include our sales to such full service distributors without
reference to their sales to their own customers. The allocations below reflect
changes made by us to the categories historically reported.

Our customers include CCE, CCBC, Consolidated, United and other TCCC
North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), AB
Distributors, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore &
Company, Pepsi Canada, ULC (“Pepsi Canada”) (terminated by us effective December 31,
2008), Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway, Inc. and

SUPERVALU, Inc.

A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts
purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material
negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of
operations. CCE, a customer of the DSD segment with sales within specific
markets in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries
in Europe, accounted for approximately 27% of our net sales for the year ended December 13,
2009. The DPS Group, a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for
approximately 13% and 16% of our net sales for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. Our distribution agreement with the DPS Group was
terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The terminated DPS Group
territories are now serviced by a combination of TCCC North American Bottlers
and AB Distributors. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of
both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and
12% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Seasonality

Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat
seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the
highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be
affected by weather conditions. Sales of our beverage products may become
increasingly subject to seasonal fluctuations as more sales occur outside of
California with respect to our products. However, the energy drink category
appears to be less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of
our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal
fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be
affected by other factors, including the introduction of new products, the
opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the
addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of sales of our
finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising, marketing and
promotional expenses.

Intellectual Property

We
presently have approximately 750 registered trademarks and pending applications
in various countries worldwide, and we apply for new trademarks on an ongoing
basis.  Substantially all of our global
trademarks are owned by HBC.  We regard
our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and
similar intellectual property as very important to our business.  We consider Hansen’s Natural Sodas®, Hansen’s®,
Blue Sky®, Junior Juice®, Monster®, Monster Energy®, M Monster Energy®, M
(stylized)®, Java Monster

TM

and Unleash the Beast!® to be our core
trademarks.


We
protect our trademarks by applying for registrations and registering our
trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with
government agencies in other countries around the world, particularly where our
products are distributed and sold.  We
also register copyrights in the statements, graphics and content appearing on
the packaging of our products.

Depending
upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or
their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to
have become generic.  Registrations of
trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use.

We
enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or
denigrating our trademarks, opposing registration of infringing trademarks, and
initiating litigation as necessary.

Government Regulation

The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of
our products are subject to various federal and state regulations, including
but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health
Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local
statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale,
safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the
United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products
are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.

California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product
that contains a component listed by the State of California as having been
found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage
producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products
because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds
below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of
listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning
labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the
product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water
supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our
beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot
predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to
the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether, or to
what extent, a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of
our products.

Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that
require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage
containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other
deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in
certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar
legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state
and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.

Compliance with Environmental
Laws

Our facilities in the United
States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect
such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital
expenditures, net income or competitive position.

In California, we are required to collect redemption
values from our customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of
California Department of Conservation based upon the number of cans and bottles
of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other states
and Canada where Hansen’s® products are sold, we are also required to collect
deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective state
agencies based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and
non-carbonated products sold in such states.


Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we employed a total of
1,430 employees of which 710 were employed on a full-time basis. Of our 1,430
employees, we employed 289 in administrative and operational capacities and
1,141 persons in sales and marketing capacities.

ITEM 1A.       RISK
FACTORS

In addition to the other information in this report,
you should carefully consider the following risks. If any of the following
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating
results could be materially adversely affected. The risk factors summarized
below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not
currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating
results.

Changes
in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products.

There is increasing
awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. This may
reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability.

Consumers are seeking greater variety in their
beverages. Our future success will depend,
in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and
innovative beverages. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must
continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be
competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no
assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers
will continue to purchase our products in the future. Additionally, many of our
products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during
recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins, which would
adversely affect our results of operations. Product lifecycles for some
beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years
before consumers’ preferences change. The beverages we currently market are in
varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that
such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and
shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such
preferences. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and
packaging initiatives. We also may be unable to penetrate new markets. If
our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of
operations will be adversely affected.

Significant
changes in government regulation may hinder sales.

The production, distribution and sale in the United
States of many of our products are subject to various federal and state
regulations, including, but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational
Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and various other
federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production,
transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such
products. New statutes and regulations may also be instituted in the future.  If a regulatory authority finds that a
current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of
these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled
and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, thus adversely affecting
our financial condition and operations. In particular, California law requires
that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed
by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth
defects. While we do not believe that any of our beverage products are required
to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important
component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the
future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under
this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.

Public
health officials and health advocates are focusing on obesity, especially among
children, and are encouraging consumers to reduce consumption of sweetened
beverages. Possible new local and/or county and/or state and/or federal taxes,
increased regulation on labeling and negative publicity may reduce sales of our
products and may adversely affect our financial condition or results of
operations.


Additionally,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently proposed revising
regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on
food and beverage products.  If
definitive regulation is promulgated, we may incur significant costs to alter
our existing packaging materials to comply with such regulations.  Additionally, revised serving size
information may impact and/or reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and
consumption of our products by our consumers.

The
ongoing economic downturn and continued uncertainty in the financial markets
and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of
the major countries in which we do business may adversely affect our industry,
business and results of operations.

The global credit and financial markets have continued
to experience extreme disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and
credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic
growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic
stability. There can be no assurance that there will not be further
deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic
conditions. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a
number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future
business activities. The current adverse global economic conditions and
tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone
spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their
existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties
experienced by our suppliers or customers could result in product delays,
increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable
to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the
credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions, and if the
current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our
business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Operations
outside the United States expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in
international markets.

Our
gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 12.8%,
8.0% and 5.2% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and our growth strategy includes expanding
our international business. If we are unable to expand distribution of our
products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely
affected. In many international markets, we have relatively little or no
operating experience. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain
international operations and promote our brands internationally. We face and
will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign
operations, including: economic or political instability in our international
markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign
profits to the United States, including possible taxes or withholding
obligations on any repatriations; and the imposition of tariffs or trade
restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to
sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Also, our operations outside of the United States are subject to
risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local
operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption, credit risk of
local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences.

Fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.

We are
exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales,
expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar. We have not used instruments to hedge certain foreign currency
risks and are not protected against foreign currency fluctuations. As a result,
our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. Moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results
from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be
unsustainable over time.


Increased competition could hurt our business.

The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of
competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and
marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced
by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially
greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.

Important
factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and
flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective
development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different
packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with
all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially
better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and
internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Red Bull Gmbh, the DPS
Group, Kraft Foods Inc., and Nestle Beverage Company. We also compete with companies
that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations such as Tree Top
and Ocean Spray. Our products also compete with private label brands such as
those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club
stores. Our Java Monster

TM

product line competes directly with Starbucks
Frappuccino, Starbucks Double Shot, Starbucks Double Shot Energy Plus Coffee
and other Starbucks coffee drinks, Rockstar Roasted, Caribou Coffee, Cinnabon
coffee drinks, Godiva dairy based drinks and Full Throttle Coffee.

There can be no assurance that we will not encounter
difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position
due to competition in the beverage industry. If our revenues decline, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

We derive a substantial portion of revenues from
our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the “energy drink” category could
adversely affect our operating results.

A substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks,
including in particular our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Our DSD
segment, which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 91.9% of net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2009. Any decrease in the sales of
our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect
our future revenues and net income. Historically, we have experienced
substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category. Our
energy drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full Throttle, No Fear,
Amp, Adrenaline Rush, NOS, Venom, Redline, 180, Red Devil, Rip It,
Vitaminenergy, Starbucks Double Shot, Starbucks Double Shot Energy Plus Coffee,
Rockstar Roasted, Full Throttle Coffee, 5-Hour Energy Shot, Stacker 2, Red Bull
Energy Shot, Redline Energy Shot, NOS Energy Shot, Rockstar Energy Shot, Full
Throttle Quick Shot, Amp Energy Shot and many other brands. A number of
companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different
packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including Sobe,
Snapple, Arizona, Fuse, and Vitamin Water, have added supplements to their
products with a view to marketing their products as “functional” or energy
beverages or as having “functional” benefits. 
In addition, certain large companies such as TCCC and PepsiCo, market
and/or distribute products in that market segment such as Pepsi Max, Mountain
Dew, Mountain Dew MDX and Vault. Competitive pressures in the energy drink
category could impact our revenues or we could experience price erosion or
lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business and results.

We rely
on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are
unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers
and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or
unavailable to us, our business could suffer.

We do not directly manufacture our products, but
instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers.

In the event of a disruption or delay, we
may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially
reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. In addition,
there are limited alternative packing facilities in the United States, Canada,
Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Europe with adequate capacity and/or
suitable equipment for many of


our products, including Hansen’s® brand energy drinks
in 8.3-ounce cans, our PET tea line, Hansen’s® Sparkling beverages in
10.5-ounce sleek cans, aseptic juice products, juices in 64-ounce PET plastic
bottles, Monster Energy®, Nitrous

TM

Monster Energy®, X-Presso Monster

TM

-Hammer, Lost® Energy

TM

and Rumba®, Samba, Tango energy drinks in
6.75-ounce and/or 8.3-ounce and/or 12-ounce and/or 15.5-ounce and/or 16-ounce
and/or 24-ounce and/or 32-ounce and/or 500ml aluminum cans and/or 550ml BRE aluminum
cans and/or 500ml glass bottles and/or 12-ounce, 15-ounce and 24-ounce aluminum
cap cans, our Java Monster

TM

product line in 15-ounce aluminum cans,
Monster Hitman Energy Shooter

TM

’s, our
Peace Tea

TM

product
line in 23-ounce aluminum cans and other products. A disruption or delay in
production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from
such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the United States and
abroad with adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at
commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if
at all. Consequently, a disruption in production of such products could
adversely affect our revenues.

We rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our DSD
products.  If we are unable to maintain
good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure
such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer.

We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering
into agreements with regional bottlers or other direct store delivery
distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution
organizations. Many of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and
manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands
and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including
energy drinks. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products.

The
TCCC North American Bottlers and AB Distributors are our primary domestic and
international distributors of our Monster Energy® beverages. If we are unable
to maintain good relationships with the TCCC North American Bottlers and AB
Distributors, or if the TCCC North American Bottlers and/or AB Distributors do
not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors,
sales of our Monster Energy® beverages could be adversely affected. The
recently announced proposed transactions between CCE and TCCC could affect our
existing distribution arrangements. Detailed deal terms have not yet been fully
disclosed. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact the
proposed transactions could have on the distribution of our products.

The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our
success. If our DSD brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers
and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and
distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market and promote
our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our
competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

Our customers are material to our success.  If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer.

Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience
chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers
to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at
any time, which could cause our business to suffer.

The DPS Group, a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for
approximately 13% and 16% of our net sales for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. Our distribution agreement with the DPS Group was
terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The related terminated
distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of the TCCC North
American Bottlers and AB Distributors. If the TCCC North American Bottlers
and/or AB Distributors are generally not as successful in selling our products
as the DPS Group was, this could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and consolidated results of operations.


CCE, a customer of the DSD segment with sales in specific markets in
the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries in Europe,
accounted for approximately 27% of our net sales for the year ended December 31,
2009. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD
and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and 12% of our net
sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. A decision by CCE, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club) or
any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease
carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and consolidated results of operations.

Increases
in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could
harm our business.

The principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, PET plastic
bottles, as well as juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk and cream, the
costs of which are subject to fluctuations. In addition, certain of our co-pack
arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain
of their own cost increases. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the
above or any other raw materials or ingredients will rise in the future and
whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We
do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks
associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials.

In addition, some of these raw materials, such as
certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers.

Our
failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect
our business and financial results.

We may
not correctly estimate demand for our products. 
Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise,
particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid
growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for
our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials
including, but not limited to, PET plastic bottles, cans, glass, labels,
sucralose, flavors, supplements, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, or
packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term
basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates,
supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the
future, be experienced. Such shortages could interfere with and/or delay
production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect
on our business and financial results. We generally do not use hedging
agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk.

The costs
of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we
may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers.

Many of our packaging supplies contracts allow our
suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on
changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce
those packaging supplies, such as resin for PET bottles, aluminum for cans and
pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. These changes in the prices we pay for
our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by
product and supplier. In some cases, we fix the prices of certain packaging
supplies for a reasonable period. In other cases, we bear the risk of increases
in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the
commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. We do not use derivative
instruments to manage this risk. If the costs of these packaging supplies
increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through
corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.


We rely
upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers.  If we are unable to source our flavors on
acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our
business.

Generally,
flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. Consequently, we
do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of
our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain these
flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. If we must
replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our
ability to deliver products to our customers which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our
intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such
rights could materially adversely affect our business.

We own numerous trademarks that are very important
to our business.  We also own the
copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products.
We regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as
critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property with
registered and common law trademarks and copyrights, restrictions on disclosure
and other actions to prevent infringement. However, there can be no assurance
that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and
similar proprietary rights. If we lose some or all of our intellectual property
rights, our business may be materially adversely affected.

If we are
unable to maintain brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product
recalls, our business may suffer.

Our success depends on our ability to build and
maintain brand image for our existing products, new products and brand
extensions. We have no assurance that our advertising, marketing and
promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products’ brand image
and on consumer preferences. Product quality and/or ingredient content issues,
efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product
contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the
affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. We may be
required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific
co-packers, markets or batches. Product recalls could adversely affect our
profitability and our brand image. We do not maintain recall insurance.

While
we have to date not experienced any credible product liability litigation,
there is no assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the
future. In the event we were to experience product liability claims or a
product recall, our financial condition and business operations could be
materially adversely effected.

If we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels
or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient
quantities, or if our retailers’ inventory levels are too high, our operating
results will be adversely affected.

If we do not accurately
anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take
to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our
results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our
shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or
retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be
delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis,
we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the
inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too
high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would
unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results.

If we are
not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an
adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find
suitable replacements.


Our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon
the services of our senior management. 
We do not maintain key person life insurance for any members of our
senior management. The loss of services of either Mr. Sacks, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Schlosberg, President and Chief Financial
Officer, Mr. Hall, President of the Monster Beverage Division, or any other key
members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until
suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of personnel
with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to
locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.

Climate
change may negatively affect our business.

There is concern that a gradual increase in global
average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around
the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters.
While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of
our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural
productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability or increase the
cost of certain key ingredients used in our products. Increased frequency or
duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production
capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the
availability of and/or result in higher prices for juice concentrates and
natural flavors, or impact demand for our products. In addition, public
expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in
increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to
make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the
effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business
and results of operations. Sales of our products may also be influenced to some
extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Weather
conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which
could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Potential
changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our
financial results.

We cannot predict the impact that future changes in
accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. New
accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could
adversely affect our reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income
tax rates could affect after tax income. 
Equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes
pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers) could affect our products’
affordability and reduce our sales.

Volatility
of stock price may restrict sale opportunities.

Our
stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder
expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our
competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections
by the investment community and public comments by other persons and many other
factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may be unable to achieve
analysts’ earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales
of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable
than others. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve projected
levels or mixes of product sales. As a result, our stock price is subject to
significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at
attractive prices. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, our
stock price high was $44.02 and stock price low was $27.91.

Provisions
in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in
control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.

Our organizational documents may limit changes in
control. Furthermore, as of February 12, 2010, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg
together may be deemed to control approximately 24.8% of our outstanding common
stock. Consequently, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg could exercise
significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders,
including electing directors, amending organizational documents and
disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though
such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders.


Our cash
flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals.

We may
be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure
plans and general operating activities. In addition, the terms and/or
availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our creditors
could affect the financing of our future growth.

Our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may
cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.

At December 31,
2009, we had $328.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $99.3 million in
short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts
in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may
have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and
money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are
subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may
be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various
sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These
market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative
adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition. At the current time, we are not increasing our investments in
auction rate securities nor investing in corporate bonds.

Certain of our short-term investments and all of our
long-term investments are comprised of municipal or educational related or
other public body notes with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”).
The majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating
and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline
insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals,
usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities
was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell
their notes at periodic auctions. At December 31, 2009, we held auction
rate securities with a face value of $96.4 million (amortized cost basis of
$92.0 million). During the year ended December 31, 2009, the auctions for
these auction rate securities failed. We determined that there was an
impairment of our auction rate securities of $12.1 million, resulting in a fair
value of $84.3 million, which is included in short and long-term investments in
our consolidated financial statements. We determined that of the $12.1 million
impairment of our auction rate securities, $7.7 million was deemed temporary. This
amount has been recorded, net of a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31,
2009.  In addition, we determined that
$3.9 million of the impairment was an other-than-temporary impairment and
recorded a charge in other income (expense) in our consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 ($0.5 million had been
previously deemed other-than-temporary and was charged to other income
(expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008.) There is no assurance
that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment
portfolio will succeed. The auction failures appear to have been attributable
to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from
financial advisors and sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction,
the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay
interest at a default rate that is above market rates for similar instruments.
The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or
pay interest at their predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to
35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the
securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties.
As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of
our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently,
these securities, except those that were redeemed at par after December 31,
2009 and 2008, are classified as long-term investments in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

If the
issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to refinance their debts
and call the notes or successfully close future auctions and their credit
ratings deteriorate, we may be required to record additional impairment charges
on these investments in the future. If uncertainties in the credit and capital
markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities
held by us, we may be


required to recognize
additional impairments on these investments. We may be required to wait until
market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity
of the underlying notes (up to 40 years) to realize our investments’
recorded value (See “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative And Quantitative
Disclosures About Market Risks” and “Part II, Item 8, Note 2 and 3 in our
consolidated financial statements).

If we fail to maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in
our Company could be materially and adversely affected.

We are required to maintain both disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective
for the purposes described in “Part II, Item 9A – Controls and Procedures.”
If we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition
or the value of our stock could be materially harmed.

Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to
significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.

We are
a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings,
including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business
practices and false advertising, breach of contract claims, securities actions
and shareholder derivative actions. Material legal proceedings are described
more fully in “Part I, Item 3 – Legal Proceedings” and in Part II,
Item 8, Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K.

Defending
these proceedings will result in significant ongoing expenditures and the
continued diversion of our management’s time and attention from the operation
of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations.
Our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigations or legal
proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our
insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions,
revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock
to decline.

We must continually
maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.

We
rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations. During
2009, we commenced the implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning
system to replace our legacy systems in North America. This implementation
subjects us to take on inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and
changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer
orders, potential disruption of the internal control structure, substantial
capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or
difficulties in transitioning to a new system. The implementation of this
system may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs
the costs of implementation, or at all. Any information technology system
disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an
adverse effect on our business and operations. As of January 2010, we had
completed our North American transition to the SAP enterprise resource planning
system. It is our intention to complete the transition for our international
operations within fiscal 2010. We estimate the remaining costs for
implementation of the initiative will be approximately $0.8 million.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

In October 2006, we entered into a lease
agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and
distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment
provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007,
excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the
commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end
of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution space replaced our
previous warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California.
In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased
offices in Corona, California.

We have sublet a small portion of our previous leased
office, warehouse and distribution space on a month to month basis. In
addition, we continue to utilize the remaining portion of this space as
overflow for our main warehouse. This lease expires in October 2010. We
lease other office and warehouse space domestically and internationally,
including properties in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland and the United
Kingdom. We also rent additional office and warehouse space on a short-term
basis from time to time in the countries in which we operate.

In August 2008, we completed the purchase of 1.09
acres of land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. In December 2009, we
completed the purchase of an additional 2.12 acres of adjacent vacant land for
a purchase price of $1.7 million. The properties are located adjacent to our
leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of
constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of
land to replace our existing leased office space.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In September 2006,
Christopher Chavez purporting to act on behalf of himself and a class of
consumers yet to be defined filed an action in the Superior Court of the State
of California, City and County of San Francisco, against the Company and its
subsidiaries for unfair business practices, false advertising, violation of
California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation
alleging that the Company misleadingly labels its Blue Sky beverages as
manufactured and canned/bottled wholly in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Defendants removed this Superior Court action
to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
under the Class Action Fairness Act, and filed motions for dismissal or
transfer.  On June 11, 2007, the
United States District Court, Northern District of California granted the
Company’s motion to dismiss Chavez’s complaint with prejudice. On June 23,
2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit filed a
memorandum opinion reversing the opinion of the United States District Court
and remanded the case to the United States District Court for further
proceedings.  A class certification
hearing is scheduled for March 2010. The Company has filed a motion to
dismiss the Consumer Legal Remedies Act claims that is set for hearing on March 4,
2010.  Chavez has filed a motion for a
decision on a preemption issue that will be heard on the same day.  The Company believes it has meritorious
defenses to the allegations and plans a vigorous defense.  Discovery has just begun.

On July 11,
2008, the Company initiated an action against Citigroup Inc., Citigroup Global
Markets, Inc., and Citi Smith Barney, in the United States District Court,
Central District of California, for violations of federal securities laws and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, arising out of the Company’s
purchase of auction rate securities.  The
Court granted the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration before the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). 
The matter is now proceeding before FINRA and has been set for hearing
in March 2010.

On August 28,
2008, the Company initiated an action against Oppenheimer Holdings Inc.,
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., and Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc., in the
United States District Court, Central District of California, for violations of
federal securities laws and the Investment Advisors Act, arising out of the
Company’s purchase of auction rate securities. 
The defendants answered the complaint


on October 14, 2008
denying the allegations set forth therein. 
The Oppenheimer action was deemed a related case to the Company’s action
against Citigroup Inc. (described above). 
After the Court granted the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration in
the Citigroup Inc. case, the Company stipulated to arbitration before FINRA,
where the matter is now proceeding and has been set for hearing in August,
2010.  The Company has voluntarily dismissed,
without prejudice, its claims against Oppenheimer Asset Management, Inc.  The Panel denied Oppenheimer Holdings, Inc.’s
motion to be dismissed from the proceeding.

In May 2009,
Avraham Wellman, purporting to act on behalf of himself and a class of consumers
in Canada, filed a putative class action in the Ontario Superior Court of
Justice, in the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, against the Company and its
former Canadian distributor, Pepsi-Cola Canada Ltd., as defendants.  The plaintiff alleges that the defendants
misleadingly packaged and labeled Monster Energy® products in Canada by not
including sufficiently specific statements with respect to contra-indications
and/or adverse reactions associated with the consumption of the energy drink
products.  The plaintiff’s claims against
the defendants are for negligence, unjust enrichment, and making
misleading/false representations in violation of the Competition Act (Canada),
the Food and Drugs Act (Canada) and the Consumer Protection Act, 2002
(Ontario).  The plaintiff claims general
damages on behalf of the putative class in the amount of CDN$20 million,
together with punitive damages of CDN$5 million, plus legal costs and interest.
The plaintiff’s certification motion materials have not yet been filed.  In accordance with class action practice in
Ontario, the Company will not file an answer to the complaint until after the
determination of the certification motion. 
The Company believes that the plaintiff’s complaint is without merit and
plans a vigorous defense.

In
addition to the above matters, the Company is subject to litigation from time
to time in the normal course of business, including claims from terminated
distributors.  Although it is not
possible to predict the outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to
the Company and after consultation with counsel, management believes that such
litigation in the aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Securities
Litigation

— On September 11,
2008, a federal securities class action complaint styled

Cunha v.
Hansen Natural Corp., et al.

was filed in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California (the “District Court”). On September 17,
2008, a second federal securities class action complaint styled

Brown v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al.

was also filed in the
District Court.

On July 14,
2009, the Court entered an order consolidating the actions and appointing lead
counsel and the Structural Ironworkers Local Union #1 Pension Fund as lead
plaintiff.  On August 28, 2009 lead
plaintiff filed a Consolidated Complaint for Violations of Federal Securities
Laws (the “Consolidated Class Action Complaint”).  The Consolidated Class Action Complaint
purports to be brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of the Company’s
stock during the period November 9, 2006 through November 8, 2007
(the “Class Period”).  It names as
defendants the Company, Rodney C. Sacks, Hilton H. Schlosberg, and Thomas J.
Kelly.  Plaintiff principally alleges
that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false and misleading
statements relating to the Company’s distribution coordination agreements with
Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (“AB”) and its sales of “Allied” energy drink lines,
and engaged in sales of shares in the Company on the basis of material
non-public information.  Plaintiff also
alleges that the Company’s financial statements for the second quarter of 2007
did not include certain promotional expenses. 
The Consolidated Class Action Complaint alleges violations of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and
seeks an unspecified amount of damages.

On November 16,
2009, the defendants filed their motion to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action
Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and
9(b), as well as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.  On January 8, 2010, lead plaintiff filed
its opposition to defendants’


motion to dismiss.  Defendants’ reply brief was filed on February 8,
2010 and the Company is awaiting a decision from the Court on the motion.

Derivative
Litigation

— On October 15,
2008, a derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California (the “District Court”), styled

Merckel v. Sacks, et al

. 
On November 17, 2008, a second derivative complaint styled

Dislevy v. Sacks, et al.

was also filed in the District
Court.  The derivative suits were each
brought, purportedly on behalf of the Company, by a shareholder of the Company
who made no prior demand on the Company’s Board of Directors.

On June 29,
2009, the Court entered an order consolidating the Merckel and Dislevy
actions.  On July 13, 2009, the
Court entered an order re-styling the consolidated actions as

In re Hansen Derivative Shareholder Litigation

, appointing
lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and establishing a schedule for the filing of
a consolidated amended complaint and for defendants’ response to such
complaint.

On October 13,
2009, lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the
“Consolidated Derivative Complaint”). 
The Consolidated Derivative Complaint names as defendants certain
current and former officers, directors, and employees of the Company, including
Rodney C. Sacks, Hilton H. Schlosberg, Harold C. Taber, Jr., Benjamin M.
Polk, Norman C. Epstein, Mark S. Vidergauz, Sydney Selati, Thomas J. Kelly,
Mark J. Hall, and Kirk S. Blower, as well as Hilrod Holdings, L.P.  The Company is named as a nominal
defendant.  The factual allegations of
the Consolidated Derivative Complaint are similar to those set forth in the
Consolidated Class Action Complaint described above.  Plaintiff alleges that, from November 2006
to the present, the defendants caused the Company to issue false and misleading
statements concerning its business prospects and failed to properly disclose
problems related to its non-Monster energy drinks, the prospects for the
Anheuser-Busch distribution relationship, and alleged “inventory loading” that
affected the Company’s results for the second quarter of 2007.  Plaintiff further alleges that while the
Company’s shares were purportedly artificially inflated because of those
improper statements, certain of the defendants sold Company stock while in
possession of material non-public information. The Consolidated Derivative
Complaint asserts various causes of action, including breach of fiduciary duty,
aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Cal. Corp. Code §§
25402 and 25403 for insider selling, and unjust enrichment. The suit seeks an
unspecified amount of damages to be paid to the Company and adoption of
corporate governance reforms, among other things.

On January 8,
2010, the Company filed its motion to dismiss the Consolidated Derivative
Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and
23.1.  Plaintiff’s opposition to the
motion was filed on February 22, 2010, and the Company’s reply brief is
required to be filed by March 15, 2010. 
None of the other defendants need answer, move to dismiss, or otherwise
respond to the Consolidated Derivative Complaint until or unless the District
Court orders the Company to file an answer, in which case the other defendants
will have 45 days after the filing of the Company’s answer to move to dismiss
or otherwise respond to the Consolidated Derivative Complaint.

Although the
ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, the
Company believes that the allegations in the Consolidated Class Action
Complaint and the Consolidated Derivative Complaint are without merit. The
Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits.

*Gross
sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating
performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (“GAAP”), and should not be used alone as an indicator
of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross
sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross
sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales
performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or
declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows
evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items,
which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation
of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating
performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as
promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from
customers (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations”).

We
have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise
energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and
soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily
through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment
develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Corporate
and unallocated amounts that do not relate to the DSD or Warehouse segments
specifically have been allocated to “Corporate & Unallocated.”

brand energy drinks and our Java Monster

TM

product line. Any decrease in sales of our
Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or Java Monster

TM

product line
could cause a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income.
Our DSD segment represented 91.9%, 90.7% and 89.5% of our consolidated net
sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our
Warehouse segment represented 8.1%, 9.3% and 10.5% of our consolidated net
sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Competitive
pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating
results (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).

Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our
efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and
product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at
events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize “push-pull”
methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets
and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising,
in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks,
coolers and barrel coolers. We also utilize prize promotions, price promotions,
competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality
endorsements, including from television and other well known sports
personalities, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events,
athletes and teams. In-store posters,


outdoor posters, print, radio and television
advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to
promote our brands.

We
believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is
differentiation, such as making Hansen’s® products visually distinctive from
other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and
packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them
different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products
are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and
identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to
reevaluate the same from time to time.

During
2009, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our
distribution markets, both domestically and internationally.  In particular, we continued to focus on
developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally
described as the “alternative” beverage category, with particular emphasis on
energy type drinks.

All of
our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and
co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate
arrangements with each party.

During
the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Off-Premise Agreements with
AB.  Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select
AB Distributors distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s Monster
Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

brands non-alcoholic energy drinks and Rumba®,
Samba and Tango brand energy juice, as well as additional products that may be
agreed between the parties.

During the fourth
quarter of 2008, we entered into the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement
with TCCC.  Pursuant to the TCCC North
American Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may
designate, territories in which the TCCC North American Bottlers will distribute
and sell primarily our Monster Energy® beverages (the “Products”) in the United
States and Canada.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Distribution
Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE was appointed to distribute, directly
and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in the U.S. Territories. We
may designate additional territories within reasonable proximity to the U.S.
Territories and CCE will use reasonable good faith efforts to add the
additional territories. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the
Monster Energy Canadian Distribution Agreement with CCBC, pursuant to which
CCBC has been appointed to distribute, directly and through certain
sub-distributors, the Products in Canada, with performance commencing on January 1,
2009. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into
distribution agreements with Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American
Bottlers for the distribution of Products in various territories within the United
States.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the TCCC International Coordination
Agreement with TCCC.  Pursuant to the
TCCC International Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the
future may designate, countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC distributors
to distribute and sell the Products.

During
the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy International
Distribution Agreement and the Monster Energy Belgium Distribution Agreement
with CCE pursuant to which CCE has been appointed to distribute directly and
through certain sub-distributors the Products in Great Britain, France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Monaco.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into a distribution
agreement with Comercializadora Eloro, S.A., a subsidiary of Grupo Jumex, for
exclusive distribution throughout Mexico, excluding the Baja and Sonora
regions, of our Monster Energy® and Monster Energy®


Khaos

TM

energy drinks as well as select Java Monster

TM

product line drinks. Distribution under this agreement
commenced January 26, 2009.

During the second quarter of 2009, we entered into a distribution
agreement with Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd. for exclusive distribution
throughout Australia of certain of our Monster Energy® energy drinks.
Distribution under this agreement commenced in July 2009.

Pursuant to the new and/or amended distribution
agreements entered into with certain distributors, net amounts of $5.7 million
and $113.0 million from such distributors, relating to the cost of terminating
certain of our prior distributors, were recorded for the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. Such amounts have been accounted for as deferred
revenue and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of
the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. Distributor
receivables related to these new and/or amended distribution agreements totaled
$5.2 million and $90.7 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Revenue recognized was $7.5 million, $14.3
million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Included in the $14.3 million of revenue recognized for the
year ended December 31, 2008, is $11.6 million related to the acceleration
of deferred revenue balances associated with certain of our prior distributors
who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008.

We
incurred termination costs to certain of our prior distributors amounting to
$1.9 million, $118.1 million and $15.3 million in aggregate for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such termination costs
have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Accrued distributor terminations
as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $3.0 million and $102.3 million,
respectively. In addition, inventory returned to us by certain of our
terminated distributors resulted in a reduction of gross sales of approximately
$9.7 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.

We again achieved record gross sales of $1,309.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2009. The increase in gross sales in 2009 was primarily
attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products,
particularly our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Gross sales for the year
ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made
by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new
per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors
commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in
product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations
to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We
estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31,
2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount
of our customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross sales for
the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase
announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster

TM

product line,
effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended
December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of
purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not
limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing
2007 fourth quarter prices.

For
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our percentage increase
in gross sales was 10.7%, 15.3% and 47.3%, respectively. We believe the decrease
in the year on year percentage growth rate was in part attributable to the decrease
in the overall growth rates of the markets in which we operate, in particular
of the energy drink category, to general economic conditions as well as higher overall
comparable sales levels. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the
merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing
economic conditions, inflation, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates,
prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and gas costs, income tax
rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic
conditions.  In


addition, consumer
purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers’ disposable income, credit
availability and debt levels. A continued or incremental slowdown in both the
U.S. and international economies where we market and distribute our products,
an uncertain economic outlook or prolonged credit crisis could continue to
adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower than
expected net sales and profits on a quarterly or annual basis. During 2009 and
2008, there was significant deterioration in the global and local financial
markets and economic environments, real estate markets and construction
industries, which we believe negatively impacted consumer spending at many
retailers for our products. In response to this, we have taken steps to
increase opportunities to profitably drive sales and to operate our business
more efficiently. If these adverse economic trends worsen, or if our efforts to
counteract the impacts of these trends are not sufficiently effective, there
could be a negative impact on our financial performance and position in future
fiscal periods. For further discussion of the risks to our Company posed by
general economic conditions (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).

Our
growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers
outside the United States amounted to $168.0 million, $94.2 million and $53.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Such sales were approximately 12.8%, 8.0% and 5.2% of gross sales for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The reclassification
of a portion of our gross sales to certain military customers to gross sales to
customers within the United States from gross sales to customers outside the
United States, resulted in a decrease in gross sales outside the United States
of $2.1 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively, over amounts previously reported.

Our
customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and
specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers,
convenience chains, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross
sales to our various customer types for 2009, 2008 and 2007 are reflected
below. Such information reflects sales made by us directly to the customer
types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors. Such
full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the
customer types listed below. We do not have complete details of such full
service distributors’ sales of our products to their respective customers and
therefore limit our description of our customer types to include our sales to
such full service distributors without reference to their sales to their own
customers. The allocations below reflect changes made by us to the categories
historically reported.

Our customers include CCE, CCBC, Consolidated, United and other TCCC
North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), AB
Distributors, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore &
Company, Pepsi Canada (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008), Swire
Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway, Inc. and SUPERVALU Inc. A decision
by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to
cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our
financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCE, a customer of
the DSD segment with sales within specific markets in the United States,
Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries in Europe, accounted for
approximately 27% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31,
2009. The DPS Group, a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for
approximately 13% and 16% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. Our distribution agreement with the DPS Group was
terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The related terminated
distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of


TCCC North American Bottlers and AB Distributors. Wal-Mart, Inc.
(including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions,
accounted for approximately 9%, 11% and 12% of our net sales for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We continue to incur expenditures in connection with
the development and introduction of new products and flavors.

Value Drivers of our
Business

We believe that the key
value drivers of our business include the following:

·

Profitable Growth

– We believe “functional”, “image based” or “better
for you” brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a
broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. 
We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are
expanding our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more
alternatives to consumers.  We are
focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe that tailored branding,
packaging, pricing and channeling strategies help achieve profitable growth. We
are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable
growth.

·

Cost Management

–
The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supply and production
costs. One key area of focus is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees
and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues.
Another key area of focus is the reduction of inventory days on hand.

·

Efficient Capital Structure

– Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to
finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong
capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost
and low overall costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage.

We believe that, subject to increases in the costs
of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly
implemented, will result in: (1) maintaining our gross profit margin; (2) providing
additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net
operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate
measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results
of operations.

Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating
income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the
above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management
focus in 2010 and beyond

(

See “Part II,
Item 7 – Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009
Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008”).

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
working capital of $501.8 million compared to $374.0 million as of December 31,
2008. The increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase
in trade accounts receivable, an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a
decrease in accrued distributor terminations. For the year ended December 31,
2009, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $156.2
million as compared to $199.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Principal uses of cash flows in 2009 were distributor termination fees, repurchases
of our common stock, purchases of inventory, acquisition of property and
equipment and acquisition of trademarks. Purchases of our common stock, purchases
of inventory, payments of accounts payable and income taxes are expected to be
and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the
future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).


Opportunities, Challenges
and Risks

Looking forward, our
management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the
attention of the beverage industry and our Company.  Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and
international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of
our industry and our Company. Our growth strategy includes expanding our
international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international
operations (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”). Decreased consumer
discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and
purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the
health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent
a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health
problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a
wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks,
sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet
changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety.

Our historical success is attributable, in part, to
our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will
depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different
and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to
do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to
develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in
the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and
intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing
consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such
preferences.

In addition, other key challenges and risks that
could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not
limited to:

·

changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;

·

the impact of the slowing economy in the United States and other
countries in which we operate;

·

the potential impact of the consummation of the transactions between
CCE and TCCC;

·

the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

·

maintenance of our brand image and product quality;

·

profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the
competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business - Competition and
Sales and Marketing”);

·

costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;

·

restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs;
changes in government regulations;

·

protection of our existing intellectual
property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to
develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our
expanding product lines;

·

limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such
as the 12-ounce and 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can, and co-packing
availability; and


·

the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions, increasing
concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences.

See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for
additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.

We believe that the following opportunities exist
for us:

·

growth potential for the “alternative”
beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft
drinks and teas, juices and juice drinks and enhanced waters;

·

new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability;

·

premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth;

·

significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize
profitable growth;

·

proper positioning to capture industry growth; and

·

broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and
international markets.

Gross sales, although used
internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not
be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance
with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance
in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been
defined by our internal


reporting
requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating
performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson
performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of
gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any
promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management
believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive
presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in
the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be
deducted from payments received from customers. 
(See” Part II, Item 6 – Selected Financial Data”).

**

Although the expenditures
described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet
GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP
presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and
other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other
companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an
evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and
illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and
other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities.

***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since
some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in
cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such
costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound
freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses.

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31,
2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008

Gross
Sales.*

Gross
sales were $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an
increase of approximately $126.5 million, or 10.7% higher than gross sales of
$1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The increase in gross sales was primarily
attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy
drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to sales
of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our
Nitrous™ Monster Energy® product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy
drink, as well as increased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy
Shooter™ product line and our Hansen’s Natural Sodas®. The increase in gross
sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster™
product line, our Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, apple juice and juice
blends. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively
impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter
due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for
our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to
avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to
transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource
planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1%
of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to
such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers’ purchases
during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our gross sales for the year ended December 31,
2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of
2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java
Monster™ product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross
sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately
2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price
increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute
at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Included in gross sales for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $8.2 million and $14.3
million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Promotional
and other allowances were $166.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2009, an increase of $16.9 million, or 11.4% higher than promotional and other
allowances of $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Promotional
and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from
12.6% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a
result, the percentage increase in gross sales for year ended December 31,
2009 was slightly higher than the percentage increase in net sales.

*Gross
sales – see definition above.


Net Sales.

Net sales were $1,143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an
increase of approximately $109.5 million, or 10.6% higher than net sales of $1,033.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales
was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was
attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy®
Import energy drink, our Nitrous™ Monster Energy® product line and our X-Presso
Monster™-Hammer energy drink as well as increased sales by volume of our Hansen’s
Natural Sodas®. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased
sales by volume of our Java Monster™ product line, our Lost Energy® brand
energy drinks and apple juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31,
2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the
2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing
contribution program for our Monster Energy® distributors commencing January 1,
2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our
announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise
resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that
approximately 1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were
attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our
customers’ purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during
the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in
16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ product line, effective January 1,
2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were
reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our then customers
in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases
our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Net
sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $8.2
million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred
revenue.

Case
sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 110.0 million cases for the year
ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately 7.3 million cases or
7.1% higher than case sales of 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31,
2008. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.40 for the year
ended December 31, 2009 or 3.2% higher than the average net sales price
per case of $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in
the average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the
proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products.

Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,051.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2009, an increase of approximately $113.3 million, or 12.1% higher than net
sales of $937.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase
in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales
by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the
increase in net sales for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain
new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink, our Nitrous™
Monster Energy® product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drink. The
increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially offset by decreased
sales by volume of our Java Monster™ product line and our Lost Energy® brand
energy drinks. Net sales for the DSD segment for the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related
to the recognition of deferred revenue.

Net
sales for the Warehouse segment were $92.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2009, a decrease of approximately $3.8 million, or 4.0% lower than net sales of
$95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net
sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to

decreased sales by volume of apple juice, juice blends,
sports drinks and Junior Juice® aseptic juices. The decrease in net sales for
the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of
Hansen’s Natural Sodas® and aseptic juice drinks as well as a decrease in
promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales.

Gross
Profit.**

* Gross
profit was $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an
increase of approximately $73.5 million, or 13.6% higher than the gross profit
of $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross profit as a
percentage of net sales increased to 53.6% for the year


ended December 31,
2009 from 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The increase in net sales contributed to the
increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage
of net sales was partially attributable to increased sales of DSD segment
products, which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse
segment, as well as a decrease in the percentage of sales within the DSD
segment of the Java Monster™ product line, which have lower gross profit
margins than our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. In addition, the increase
in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a decrease in
the cost of certain raw materials including certain containers and packaging
materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate.

***Gross profit
– see definition above.

Operating
Expenses

.   Total
operating expenses were $275.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2009, a decrease of approximately $100.2 million, or 26.7% lower than total
operating expenses of $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 24.1% for the year
ended December 31, 2009, compared to 36.3% for the year ended December 31,
2008. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was primarily attributable
to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated
with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the decrease in
operating expenses was partially attributable to decreased expenditures of $5.4
million for out-bound freight, decreased expenditures of $3.6 million for merchandise
displays, decreased expenditures of $2.5 million for professional service fees,
including accounting and legal costs, decreased expenditures of $2.4 million
for allocated trade development, decreased expenditures of $2.1 million for
samples, decreased expenditures of $2.2 million for demos and decreased
expenditures of $1.6 million for storage and warehouse costs.  The decrease in operating expenses in dollars
was partially offset by increased expenditures of $12.7 million for
sponsorships and endorsements, increased payroll expenses of $9.6 million,
increased expenditures of $3.5 million for commissions and royalties, increased
expenditures of $2.8 million for travel expenses, $2.8 million of increased
depreciation costs, and increased expenditures of $2.1 million for advertising.
Total operating expenses include costs of $24.1 million, or 2.1% of net sales,
and $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net sales, relating to the launch of the Monster
Energy® brand in Europe for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Included in professional service fees are legal and accounting
fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with
our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices,
related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses,
exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the
costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) professional
service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million,
for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in
connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting
practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net
sales, were 24.3% and 24.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

Contribution
Margin.

Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $389.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately
$173.2 million, or 80.1% higher than contribution margin of $216.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin
for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased sales of Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks and to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to
the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent,
the increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was attributable to
sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy® Import energy drink,
our Nitrous™ Monster Energy® product line and our X-Presso Monster™-Hammer
energy drink. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately $5.5 million higher
than contribution margin of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was
primarily attributable to an increase in gross margin as a result of decreases
in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate,
and by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result
of the


termination of our
exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services,
Women, Infant and Children (“WIC”) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008.
The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with
certain of our 64-ounce juice products.

Operating
Income.

Operating income was $337.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $173.7 million, or 106.2%
higher than operating income of $163.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2008. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2009 from 15.8% for the year ended December 31,
2008.  The increases in operating income
and operating income as a percentage of net sales were primarily due to a
decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross
profit of $73.5 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of
deferred revenue of $8.2 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively; (ii) expenditures of $1.9 million and $118.1
million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors;
and (iii) expenditures for professional service fees, net of insurance
proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants
and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($4.7)
million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.5% and 25.8% for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating income
included operating losses of $6.9 million and $10.9 million for the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in relation to the operations of
MEL, MEEL and MEAU. Operating income included operating losses of $4.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2009, in relation to the operations of
X-Truck and EMF.

Other Income (Expense)

. 
Other income (expense) was ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31,
2009, a decrease of $11.5 million from $9.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased interest revenue
earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments as well as a $3.9
million other-than temporary impairment of long-term investments.

Provision
for Income Taxes

.  Provision for income taxes was $127.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $61.5 million or
94.0% higher than the provision for income taxes of $65.4 million for the years
ended December 31, 2008.  The
increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to increased operating
income of $173.7 million. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was
37.8% and 37.7% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Net Income

. 
Net income was $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
an increase of $100.7 million or 93.2% higher than net income of $108.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The increase
in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses of
$100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. This was
partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $61.5 million
and a decrease in other income (expense) of $11.5 million.

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31,
2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007

Gross
Sales.*

Gross
sales were $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an
increase of approximately $157.1 million, or 15.3% higher than gross sales of
$1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in
gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and
increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy
drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks
(introduced in April 2007), as well as sales of certain new products such
as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter™ (introduced in September 2008), Monster
Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster
Energy® Heavy Metal™ energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). To a
lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales
by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration® vitamin
enhanced water (introduced in July 2008). In addition, the increase in
gross


sales was partially
attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the
acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our
prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in
gross sales was partially offset by inventory returned to us by certain of our
terminated distributors of approximately $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of
2008, decreased sales by volume of juice blends, Lost Energy® brand energy
drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Unbound Energy® brand
energy drinks (introduced in October 2006), Rumba® brand energy juice
(introduced in December 2004), Hansen’s® energy drinks and smoothies in
cans. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a
price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our
Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster™ line
of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We
estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were
reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in
advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $149.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $27.8
million, or 22.9% higher than promotional and other allowances of $121.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Promotional and other
allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.6% from 11.8% for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result, the
percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008
was higher than the percentage increase in net sales.

*Gross
sales – see definition above.

Net Sales.

Net sales were $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an
increase of approximately $129.3 million, or 14.3% higher than net sales of
$904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net
sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased
sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and
our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as
sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter

TM

, Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks and Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™
energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable
to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of
Vidration® vitamin enhanced water.  In
addition, the increase in net sales was partially attributable to the
recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the
deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors
terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was
partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® brand energy
drinks, juice blends, iced teas, Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks, Hansen’s®
energy drinks and Rumba® brand energy juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31,
2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of
2007 for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java
Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1,
2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were
reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in
advance of such price increases.

Case
sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 102.7 million cases for the year
ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 4.2 million cases or 4.3% higher
than case sales of 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31,
2007. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.07 for the
year ended December 31, 2008 or 9.6% higher than the average net sales
price per case of $9.19 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase
in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the
proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as well as the
price increases for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans
effective January 1, 2008, price increases for our Monster Energy® brand
energy drinks in 24-ounce cans effective July 1, 2007 and price increases
in our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks,
effective January 1, 2008. In addition, the increase in the average net
sales price per case was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6
million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance
associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the
fourth quarter of 2008.

Net
sales for the DSD segment were $937.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2008, an increase of approximately $128.1 million, or 15.8% higher than net
sales of $809.8 million for the year


ended December 31,
2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales
by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks and our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee
drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy
Shooter™, Monster Energy® MIXXD™ energy drinks, Monster Energy® Heavy Metal™
energy drinks and Vidration® vitamin enhanced water. In addition, the increase
in net sales for the DSD segment was partially attributable to the recognition
of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue
balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the
fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by
decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy® brand energy drinks, Unbound Energy®
brand energy drinks and Rumba® brand energy juice.

Net
sales for the Warehouse segment were $95.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2008, an increase of approximately $1.2 million, or 1.3% higher than net sales
of $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net
sales was primarily attributable to

increased
sales by volume of apple juice and aseptic juices. The increase in net sales
was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of juice blends, iced teas
and Hansen’s® energy drinks.  Changes in
pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Gross
Profit.**

* Gross
profit was $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an
increase of approximately $70.8 million, or 15.1% higher than the gross profit
of $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross profit as a
percentage of net sales increased slightly to 52.1% for the year ended December 31,
2008 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net
sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to the
recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the
deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors
terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit as a
percentage of net sales was also attributable to increased sales of DSD segment
products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse
segment. Such increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
partially offset by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD
segment of the Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks
that have lower gross profit margins than our Monster Energy® brand energy
drinks and to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including
certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain
juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate as well as increased trade
marketing agreement costs.

***Gross
profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities
include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales,
whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within
another line item such as operating expenses.

Operating
Expenses

.   Total operating expenses were $375.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $138.2
million, or 58.3% higher than total operating expenses of $237.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007. Total operating expenses as a percentage
of net sales was 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
26.2% for year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in operating expenses
in dollars was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million
relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a
lesser extent, the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increased
out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $5.9 million primarily due to
increased volume of shipments and increased freight rates, increased
expenditures of $17.9 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased
expenditures of $4.1 million for sampling programs, increased expenditures of
$3.1 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $1.5
million for in-store demos and increased payroll expenses of $7.3 million
(including a $3.7 million increase in stock-based compensation). The increase
in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by decreased expenditures
of $6.3 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting
fees and decreased expenditures of $3.8 million for merchandise displays. The
individual increases above include costs of $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net


sales, relating to the
launch of the Monster Energy® brand in Europe for the year ended December 31,
2008. Included in legal and accounting fees are professional service fees, net
of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of
stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other
related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $118.1
million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing
distributors; and (ii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of
insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively in connection with our special investigation of
stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other
related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.9% and 23.4% for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Contribution
Margin.

Contribution margin for the DSD segment was
$216.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of
approximately $65.5 million, or 23.3% lower than contribution margin of $281.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the
contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased expenditures
of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing
distributors. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was
offset by increased sales of our Java Monster™ line of non-carbonated dairy
based coffee drinks, the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy
drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Monster Hitman
Energy Shooter™, Monster MIXXD

TM

energy drinks and Monster Heavy Metal

TM

energy
drinks.  Contribution margin for the
Warehouse segment was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
approximately $3.4 million lower than contribution margin of $3.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin
for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross
margin as a result of increases in the costs of certain raw materials,
particularly apple juice concentrate, as well as a change from high fructose
corn syrup to higher priced sugar, which additionally increased in price, for
our soda lines.  The decrease in the
contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by a
reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the
termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department
of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children (“WIC”) Supplemental Nutrition
Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis
in which we participate with our apple, grape, white grape and pineapple
64-ounce juice products.  Juice blends
are not eligible under the new program.

Operating
Income.

Operating income was $163.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $67.4 million,
or 29.2% lower than operating income of $231.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2007. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.8% for the
year ended December 31, 2008 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31,
2007.  The decrease in operating income
and operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an
increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million. Operating income exclusive
of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $14.3 million and $1.9 million
for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable
to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain
distributors; (ii) exclusive of expenditures of $118.1 million and $15.3
million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors;
and (iii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance
proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants
and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($0.2)
million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 25.8% and 28.1% for the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.


Other Income (expense)

.  Other
income (expense) was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an
increase of $1.1 million from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue
earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have
increased significantly over the prior year. This increase was partially offset
by foreign currency transaction losses.

Provision
for Income Taxes

.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2008 was $65.4 million, as compared to $90.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007. The effective combined federal and state tax
rate was 37.7% for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Net Income

. 
Net income was $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
a decrease of $41.4 million or 27.7% lower than net income of $149.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net income was
primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million
due to the items identified above. This was partially offset by an increase in
gross profit of $70.8 million and a decrease in provision for income taxes of
$24.9 million.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Cash flows provided by operating activities –

Net cash provided by operating activities was $156.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared with net cash
provided by operating activities of $199.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating
activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $208.7 million
and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $14.0 million of
stock-based compensation, $5.8 million of depreciation and other amortization, a
$3.9 million impairment on investments and a $0.7 million provision for
doubtful accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by
operations also increased due to an $86.0 million decrease in distributor
receivables, a $9.3 million increase in accrued liabilities, an $8.5 million
decrease in inventory, a $5.0 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, a $3.9
million increase in income taxes payable and a $0.8 million increase in accrued
compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by
operating activities was reduced due to a $99.3 million decrease in accrued
distributor terminations, a $59.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a
$15.8 million decrease in accounts payable, a $6.8 million decrease in deferred
revenue, a $2.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets
and a $3.1 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options.

Cash
flows (used in) provided by investing activities

–

Net cash used
in investing activities was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2009, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $144.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31,
2009, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases
of held-to-maturity investments and property and equipment. For the year ended December 31,
2008, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases
of short- and long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale
investments. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by
investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of
held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale investments. For both periods,
cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets
consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to
support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment,
furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment
used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold
improvements. Management expects that the Company will continue to use a
portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations for purchasing
short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. From time to
time, management considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically
items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products,
storage racks, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers and other
promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and
businesses compatible with the image of our brands.


At December 31,
2009, we had $328.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $99.3 million in
short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts
in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may
have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and
money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are
subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may
be exacerbated by the U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected
various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity
issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an
adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition.

Our long-term investments are comprised of auction
rate securities.  The majority of these
notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally
backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The
applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7
to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically
provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic
auctions. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the auctions
for these auction rate securities failed, and there is no assurance that future
auctions will succeed. The auction failures have been attributable to
inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from
financial advisors and sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction,
the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay
interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar
instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to
accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined default rates and be
auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the
issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities
to third parties.  As a result, our
ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate
securities in the near term may be limited.

At December 31,
2009, the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $96.4
million (amortized cost basis of $92.0 million). A Level 3 valuation was
performed on the Company’s auction rate securities as of December 31,
2009, which indicated an impairment of $12.1 million, a decrease of $2.8
million from $14.9 million as of December 31, 2008, resulting in a fair
value of $84.3 million, which is included in short- and long-term investments.
This valuation utilized a mark to model approach which included estimates for
interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums,
and expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions
are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and
market conditions evolve.

On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 320-10-65, which modifies the
requirements for recognizing other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities
and significantly changes the impairment model for such securities. Under ASC
320-10-65, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if
the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the
security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit
Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s
amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or more likely than not will be
required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost
basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is
limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell
the security, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to
sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any
remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in
other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.  Otherwise, the entire difference between fair
value and amortized cost is charged to earnings.

Under
ASC 320-10-65, an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized through
earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is
more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt
security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if an
investor does not expect to sell a debt security, it must evaluate expected
cash flows to be received and determine if a Credit Loss has occurred. In the
event of a Credit Loss and absent the intent


or requirement to sell a
debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, only the amount associated
with the Credit Loss is recognized as loss in the income statement. The amount
of loss relating to other factors is recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss.

The
Company determined that of the $12.1 million impairment of its auction rate
securities at December 31, 2009, $7.7 million was temporary and $4.4
million was other-than-temporary.  The
other-than-temporary impairment was deemed Credit Loss related. The Company
recorded $3.9 million of other-than-temporary impairment that was deemed Credit
Loss related through earnings during the year ended December 31, 2009
($0.5 million had been previously deemed other-than-temporary and was charged
to interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2008).
At December 31, 2009, $7.7 million of temporary impairment has been
recorded, less a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss.

Based
on our ability to access cash and other short-term investments and based on our
expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of
liquidity of these investments will have a material effect on our liquidity or
working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or
there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may
be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments.

Cash flows used in financing
activities –

Net
cash used in financing activities was $82.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2009, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $98.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31,
2009, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to purchases
of common stock held in treasury of $86.2 million. For the year ended December 31,
2009, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $3.1
million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options
and proceeds of $2.5 million received from the issuance of common stock in
connection with the exercise of certain stock options.

Purchases of inventories,
increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and
equipment, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts
payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to
remain our principal recurring use of cash.

On April 25, 2008, our
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our
common stock.  During the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008, we purchased 2.6 million and 3.9 million shares, respectively,
of common stock at an average purchase price of $33.10 per share and $26.77 per
share, respectively, which we hold in treasury. No shares were purchased during
the year ended December 31, 2007. As
of December 31, 2009, approximately $10.2 million remained available under
the plan for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock.

Debt and
other obligations

–

We have a credit facility with
Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of credit, which was
amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the
credit facility, we increased our available borrowings under the revolving line
of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of
credit is effective through June 1, 2010. Interest on borrowings under the
line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or
varying London Interbank Offered Rates up to 180 days, plus an additional
percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained
by us. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31,
2009. Letters of credit issued on our behalf, totaling $0.2 million under this
credit facility, were outstanding as of December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with
the terms of our line of credit, which contain certain financial covenants,
including certain financial ratios. If any event of default shall occur for any
reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any
portion outstanding on the


line of credit
immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them,
including instituting legal proceedings.

We believe that cash available from operations,
including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient
for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials
and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities,
expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as
well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next
12 months.  Based on our current plans,
at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than
$20.0 million through December 2010. However, future business opportunities
may cause a change in this estimate.

The
following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and
related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2009:

Noncancelable
contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and
other commitments.

Purchase commitments include obligations made by us
and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the
manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms.

In
addition to the above purchase obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement
between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”), the Company has
undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce re-sealable aluminum
beverage cans through December 31, 2010. The Company’s minimum purchase
obligation under this agreement is approximately $27.3 million, subject to
compliance by Rexam with certain conditions.

In
addition to the above purchase obligations, approximately $0.4 million of
recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31,
2009, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.
Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above, we
have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $0.02 million and
interest of $0.01 million as of December 31, 2009.

In
2008, we entered into licensing and programming agreements with SAP America, Inc.
to use its global enterprise resource planning software initiative
to replace our existing legacy software in North America. The Company also
entered into agreements with Axon Solutions, Inc. and Vistex Inc. for the
implementation and configuration of the SAP software. As of January 2010, we
had completed our North American transition to the SAP enterprise resource
planning system. It is our intention to complete the transition for our
international operations within fiscal 2010. We estimate the remaining costs
for implementation of the initiative will be approximately $0.8 million.


In October 2006, we entered into a lease
agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and
distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment
provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007,
excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the
commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end
of each 30 month period. This warehouse and distribution space replaced our
previous warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California. In
September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices
in Corona, California

In August 2008, we completed the purchase of 1.09
acres of land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. In December 2009, we completed
the purchase of an additional 2.12 acres of adjacent vacant land for a purchase
price of $1.7 million. The properties are located adjacent to our leased
warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of
constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of
land to replace our existing office space.

We have sublet a small portion of our previous office,
warehouse and distribution space on a month to month basis. In addition, we
continue to utilize the remaining portion of this space as additional
warehousing to supplement our main warehouse. This lease expires in October 2010.

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements

Critical Accounting
Policies

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.  GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial
statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and
reporting policies and practices:

Investments

– Our investments in debt securities are
classified as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities
that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. All other
securities not included in the held-to-maturity category are classified as
available-for-sale. No securities are held for speculative or trading purposes.
Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates
fair market value. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive
loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Under ASC 320-10-65, a
security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present
value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s
amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if
the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis
and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before
recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary
impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit
Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be
required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost
basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is
recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. We evaluate
whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than temporary at
each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and
includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held,
market and economic trends in the industry and information on the investee
company’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’
financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair
value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may
influence the operations of the


issuer
and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.

Accounts
Receivable

– We
evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number
of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer’s
inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad
debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the
estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to
specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are
recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due
trade accounts receivable outstanding.

Inventories

– Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated
market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on
hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily
on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our
ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can
fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products
include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and
economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of
advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or
continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management’s
estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an
understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.

Long-Lived
Assets

–

Management regularly reviews property and equipment and
other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable
intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of
property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management
prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the
asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its
estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the
future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates
of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31,
2009 or 2008.

Management
believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived
assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a “critical
accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to
change from period to period because it requires company management to make
assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that
recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated
balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management’s
assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment
because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are
expected to continue to do so.

Intangibles

– Intangibles are comprised primarily of
trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in
connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water,
non-beverage products and the Monster Energy® trademark in connection with the
manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in
our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in
a number of countries around the world. We also own the Blue Sky® trademark,
which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice® trademark,
which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the
provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-


lived
trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks
over one to 25 years.

In accordance with ASC
350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is
an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of
identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares
the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset.  An impairment loss is recognized to write
down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying
amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach.  However, preparation of estimated expected
future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best
estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on
management’s impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31,
2009, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values.

In estimating future
revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on
recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and
planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our
future cash flows.

Revenue
Recognition

– We
recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is
reasonably assured.

Generally,
ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the
products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate
function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to
our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also
distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that
they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished
goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other
allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50.

Management
believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and
spoilage based on our historical experience.

Cost of
Sales

– Cost of
sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of
products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as
certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the
manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw
materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales.  Raw materials include cans, bottles, other
containers, ingredients and packaging materials.

Operating
Expenses

–
Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to
transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as
well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store
demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials
and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design
expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs,
professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to
certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation
and other general and administrative costs.

Stock-Based Compensation

– We account for share-based
compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair
values. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the
fair value of our stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our
employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are


generally subject to vesting restrictions and are
generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately
expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of
an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be
realized by an employee. We use historical data to estimate the expected price
volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The
risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not
consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key
assumptions, we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or
income tax expense, which could be material to our results of operations.

Income
Taxes

– The
Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set
forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined
based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during
the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is
recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the
Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax
planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not
be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the
valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in
which such determination is made.

The
Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all
years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts,
circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax
positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will
be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that
may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority
that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax
positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be
sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

See Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies – Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” for a full
description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective
expected dates of adoption and effects on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

Sales

The
table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the
past five years.  Data from any one or
more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing
trends.

Sales of beverages are
expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal
to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or
concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. The
Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case
equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us.

Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal
trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months
of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower
during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary
historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long
temperate climate, the effect of seasonal


fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however,
such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of our products
expands outside of California. Our experience with our energy drink products
suggests they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage
of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase,
seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may
also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products,
the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced,
the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of
our finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and
promotional expenses.  (See “Part I,
Item 1 – Business – Seasonality”).

¹

Net Revenues for the fourth quarter of
2008 included the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the
acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our
prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Average price per
case exclusive of this recognition was $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months
and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively.

Inflation

We do not believe that inflation had a significant
impact on our results of operations for the periods presented.

Forward-Looking Statements

The
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a safe
harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.  Certain statements made in this report may
constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and
Section 21.E of the Exchange Act, as amended) regarding the expectations

statement of future
economic performance contained in management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations, including statements related to
new products, volume growth and statements encompassing general optimism about
future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the
words “believes,” “thinks,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” and similar

The
foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time
in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not
exhaustive.  See “Part I, Item 1A –
Risk Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties
and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors
described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could
cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed
in any of our forward-looking statements. 
Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results.
Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results
described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent
uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse
than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates
and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim
any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates
and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order
to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of
unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities
laws.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
  DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the
normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a
variety of risks.  The principal market
risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and
prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel prices,
commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw
materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum
for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as cane sugar, glucose,
sucrose and milk and cream, which are used in many of our products) and limited
availability of certain raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with
respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased
costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which
we operate. In addition, we are subject to other risks associated with the
business environment in which we operate, including the collectability of
accounts receivable.

We do
not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations
in interest rates and do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. We
do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks
associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials.

Our
gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 12.8%
and 8.0% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our
international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in
foreign exchange rates. These changes result in cumulative translation
adjustments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical 10%
adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31,
2009 to be significant. For the year ended December 31, 2009 we did not
use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency
fluctuations.

We are
primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the
effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our short-term and
long-term investments. Certain of our short-term and long-term investments are
subject to interest rate risk because these investments generally include a
fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these investments are affected
by changes in prevailing interest rates.

At December 31,
2009, we had $328.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $99.3 million in
short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts
in U.S. government agencies, municipal securities or notes (which may have an
auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money
market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject
to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be
exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults, which have affected various
sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. At the
current time, we are not increasing our investments in auction rate securities
nor investing in corporate bonds.

The
applicable interest rate on auction rate securities is reset at pre-determined
intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for auction rate
securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders
to sell their notes. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. Based on an assessment
of fair value as of December 31, 2009, we determined that there was a
decline in fair value of our auction rate securities of $12.1 million. We
determined that of the $12.1 million decline in fair value of our auction rate
securities at December 31, 2009, $7.7 million was deemed temporary. This
amount has been recorded less a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as a component of
other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2009. In addition, we determined
that the remaining $3.9 million was an other-than-temporary Credit Loss and
recorded a charge in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31,
2009 ($0.5 million had been previously deemed


other-than-temporary and
was charged to interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31,
2008). There is no assurance that future auctions of any auction rate
securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. These market risks
associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our
future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (See “Part I,
Item 1A Risk Factors –

Our investments in
marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and
affect the liquidity of these investments”

and “Part I, Item 7 –
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

–

Under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are adequate and
effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and
forms of the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and (2) is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

– Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
management’s evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2009.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which
is included herein.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

– There were no changes in internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,
2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of

Hansen Natural Corporation

Corona, California

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Hansen Natural
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 of the Company and
our report dated March 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedule.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT
SCHEDULE


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hansen Natural Corporation

Corona, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hansen Natural Corporation and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive
income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2009.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
Item 15(a).  These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall consolidated financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the

Company
as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the
criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1,
2010, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization

– Hansen Natural Corporation (the “Company”
or “Hansen”) was incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1990. The Company
is a holding company and has no operating business except through its
consolidated subsidiaries.

Nature of
Operations

– The
Company develops, markets, sells and distributes “alternative” beverage
category natural sodas, fruit juices, juice blends, juice drinks, energy drinks
and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and “functional” drinks,
non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks,
Junior Juice® juices, Junior Juice Water and flavored sparkling beverages under
the Hansen’s® brand name. The Company develops, markets, sells and distributes
energy drinks under the following brand names: Monster Energy®, Monster Hitman
Energy Shooter

TM

, Nitrous

TM

Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

brand names as
well as Rumba®, Samba and Tango brand energy juices. The Company markets, sells
and distributes the Java Monster

TM

line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee +
energy drinks and

X-Presso Monster™-Hammer energy drinks.

The Company markets, sells and
distributes a line of ready-to-drink iced teas under the Peace Tea

TM

brand name,
natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas,
seltzer waters, and energy drinks under the Blue Sky® brand name and enhanced
water beverages under the Vidration

TM

brand name.

Basis of Presentation

– The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the
accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Subsequent
Events

–
Management has reviewed and evaluated subsequent events and transactions
occurring after the balance sheet date through the filing of this annual report
on Form 10-K on March 1, 2010.

Principles of Consolidation

– The Company consolidates all entities
that it controls by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable
interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Variable Interest Entities

–

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company formed two marketing
entities, X-Truck (dissolved in November 2009), in which the Company had a
66.7% ownership interest and EMF, in which the Company has a 50.01% ownership
interest.  In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
ASC 810-10-05-8, the Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of
X-Truck and EMF, as the equity-at-risk is not sufficient to support either
entity’s activities and/or the Company would absorb the majority of expected
losses. Accordingly, the Company has consolidated the results of both X-Truck
and EMF in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The results of
operations and net assets of X-Truck and EMF at December 31, 2009 were not
material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

–

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at
financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company
has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect
to incur any losses in the future.

Investments

– The Company’s investments in debt
securities are classified as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, in
accordance with ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those


HANSEN
NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

securities that the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. All other
securities not included in the held-to-maturity category are classified as
available-for-sale.  No securities are
held for speculative or trading purposes. Held-to-maturity securities are
recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. Under ASC 320-10-65, a security is
considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash
flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost
basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value
of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the
investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of
the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment
exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the
investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell
the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any
remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in
other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates
whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at
each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and
includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held,
market and economic trends in the industry and information on the investee
company’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors’
financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
temporary include length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair
value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may
influence the operations of the issuer and the Company’s intent and ability to
retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for
any anticipated recovery of fair value.

Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on
a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a
specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company,
a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the
recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will
ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of
potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s
recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts
receivable outstanding.

Inventories

– Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in,
first-out (FIFO) cost or market value (net realizable value).

Property and Equipment

– Property and equipment are stated at
cost.  Depreciation of furniture and
fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and
vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is
calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the
terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method.
Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures
that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The
related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated
and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.

Capitalized Software Costs

– In accordance with ASC Topic 350-40,
the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or
obtaining internal use software. Costs incurred in the preliminary project
stage are expensed. All direct external costs incurred to develop internal use
software during the development stage are capitalized and amortized using the
straight-line method over the remaining useful lives. Costs such as maintenance
and training are expensed as incurred.

Intangibles

– Intangibles are comprised of
trademarks representing the Company’s exclusive ownership of the Hansen’s®
trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of
beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy® trademark in
connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and
beverages. The Company also owns a number of other trademarks in the United
States as well as in a number of countries around the world.  In addition, the Company owns the Blue Sky®
trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice®
trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. In accordance with ASC 350,
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are
measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an
impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the
carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value.
If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded.
The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their
respective useful lives, which range from 1 to 25 years. For the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were no impairments
recorded.

Long-Lived Assets

– Management regularly reviews property and equipment
and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible
assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable.  If
there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of
future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash
flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is
recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value
is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a
rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the business risks.
Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective
and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected
future conditions. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, there were no impairment losses recorded.

Foreign
Currency Translation and Transactions

– The accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries
are translated in accordance with ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they
occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the
translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign
currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that
are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or
anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.

Revenue
Recognition

– The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability is reasonably assured.

Generally,
ownership of and title to the Company’s products passes to customers upon
delivery of the products to customers. 
Certain of the Company’s distributors may also perform a separate
function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, ownership of
and title to the Company’s products that are co-packed on the Company’s behalf
by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when
the Company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of
the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. Net sales have been
determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance
with ASC 605-50.

Management
believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and
spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience.


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

Cost of
Sales

– Cost of
sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of
products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as
certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the
manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control
costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales.  Raw materials include cans, bottles, other
containers, ingredients and packaging materials.

Operating
Expenses

–
Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to
transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as
well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs,
costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items,
sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses.  Operating expenses also include such costs as
payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees,
termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors,
depreciation and other general and administrative costs.

Freight-Out Costs

– For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, freight-out costs amounted to $39.8 million, $45.1 million and $40.8
million, respectively, and have been recorded in operating expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Advertising
and Promotional Expenses

– The Company accounts for advertising production costs by expensing
such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. A
significant amount of the Company’s promotional expenses result from payments
under endorsement and sponsorship contracts. Accounting for endorsement and
sponsorship payments is based upon specific contract provisions. Generally,
endorsement and sponsorship payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over
the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance
compliance provisions of the contracts. Advertising and promotional expenses,
including but not limited to production costs, amounted to $86.7 million, $84.6
million and $66.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Advertising and promotional expenses are included in
operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Income
Taxes

– The
Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth
in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on
the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of
assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the
years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded
when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company
considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning
strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able
to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation
allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such
determination is made.

The
Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all
years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts,
circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax
positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will
be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that
may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority
that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax
positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be
sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation

– The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation under the provisions of ASC 718. 
ASC 718 requires the fair value of all stock option awards issued to
employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period. Generally,
the Company recognizes these


HANSEN
NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in
Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

compensation costs
net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period of the reward, which is typically the vesting term of five
years.

Net Income Per Common Share

– In accordance with ASC 260, net income
per common share, on a basic and diluted basis, is presented for all
periods.  Basic net income per share is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive
common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of common equivalent
shares assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury
share repurchases at average market prices, as applicable.

Concentration of Risk –

Certain of the Company’s products utilize
components (raw materials and/or co-packing services) from a limited number of
sources. A disruption in the supply of such components could significantly
affect the Company’s revenues from those products, as alternative sources of
such components may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or within
a reasonably short time period. The Company continues to take steps on an
ongoing basis to secure the availability of alternative sources for such
components and minimize the risk of any disruption in production.

Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (“CCE”), a customer of the DSD segment
with sales within specific markets in the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and certain countries in Europe, accounted for approximately 27% of our
net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Dr. Pepper
Snapple Group, Inc., a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for
approximately 13% and 16% of our net sales for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a
customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately
9%, 11% and 12% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

Credit Risk

– The Company sells its products nationally and
internationally, primarily to retailers and beverage distributors. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not
require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses,
and historically, such losses have been within management’s expectations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

– The carrying value of the Company’s
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value
due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments.

Use of Estimates

– The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

– On July 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 105 which established only two levels of
U.S. GAAP, authoritative and nonauthoritative. The FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (the “Codification”) became the source of authoritative,
nongovernmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are sources of
authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC
accounting literature not included in the Codification became nonauthoritative.
The adoption of the Codification did not have any impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820 for its financial
assets and liabilities. The Company’s adoption of ASC 820 did not have a
material impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In accordance with ASC 820-10-55, the Company elected to defer until January 1,
2009 the adoption of ASC 820 for all non-financial assets and liabilities that
are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
recurring basis. The adoption of ASC 820 for those assets and liabilities
within the ASC 820-10-55 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

On April 1,
2009, the Company adopted ASC 825-10-65, which amended ASC 825-50 to require
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting
periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements.
ASC 825-10-65 also amends ASC 825-10 to require those disclosures in summarized
financial information at interim reporting periods.  ASC 825-10-65 does not require disclosures
for earlier periods presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption.
Comparative disclosures are required for periods ending after initial adoption.
The Company’s adoption of ASC 825-10-65 did not have a material impact on its
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

On April 1,
2009, the Company adopted ASC 320-10-65, which modifies the requirements for
recognizing other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities and
significantly changes the impairment model for such securities. Under ASC
320-10-65, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if
the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the
security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit
Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s
amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or more likely than not will be
required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost
basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is
limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell
the security, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to
sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any
remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in
other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. Otherwise, the
entire difference between fair value and amortized cost is charged to earnings.
This standard also modifies the presentation of other-than-temporary impairment
losses and increases related disclosure requirements. The Company’s adoption of
this standard did not have a material impact on its financial position, results
of operations or liquidity (see Note 2).

On April 1,
2009, the Company adopted ASC 820-10-65, which provides additional guidance for
estimating fair value in accordance with ASC 820 when the volume and level of
activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. ASC 820-10-65
also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction
is not orderly.  This standard does not
require disclosures for earlier periods presented for comparative purposes at
initial adoption. In periods after initial adoption, comparative disclosures
are required for periods ending after initial adoption. The Company’s adoption
of this standard did not have a material impact on its financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

On April 1,
2009, the Company adopted ASC 855, which establishes general standards of
accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.  Specifically, it sets forth the period after
the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should
evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or
disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity
should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date
in its financial statements, and the disclosure that an entity should make
about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The
Company’s adoption of this standard did not have an impact on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

In June 2009, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)”
(“SFAS No. 167”) codified in December 2009 as Update No. 2009-17
under ASC 810-50.  ASC 810-50 amends the
consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities and requires
enhanced disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable interest
entity. This statement also requires ongoing assessments of whether an
enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. ASC 810-50
is effective beginning January 1, 2010. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect of ASC 810-50 on its financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.

In August 2009,
the FASB issued Update No. 2009-05 (“ASU 2009-05”), which amends ASC 820
to provide further guidance on measuring the fair value of a liability. It
primarily does three things: 1) sets forth the types of valuation techniques to
be used to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the
identical liability is not available, 2) clarifies that when estimating the
fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to include a
separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a
restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability, and 3) clarifies that
both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the
measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded
as an asset in an active market, when no adjustments to the quoted price of the
asset are required, are Level 1 fair value measurements. This standard became
effective for the Company beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Company’s
adoption of ASU 2009-05 did not have a material impact on its financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

In September 2009, the FASB issued Update No. 2009-13, which updates
the existing guidance regarding multiple-element revenue arrangements currently
included under ASC 605-25. The revised guidance primarily provides two
significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence
of the fair-value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to
be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) eliminates the residual
method to allocate the arrangement consideration. The guidance also expands the
disclosure requirements for revenue recognition and will be effective for the
first annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with
early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively
applied to the beginning of the year of adoption. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect of this update on its financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.

In January 2010,
the FASB issued Update No. 2010-6, “Improving Disclosures About Fair Value
Measurements” (“ASU 2010-6”), which requires reporting entities to make new
disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including
significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value
measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on
a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements. ASU
2010-6 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which are effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect of this update on its financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.

FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS
AND LIABILITIES

ASC 820 provides a
framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding
fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a
fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs, where available. The three levels of inputs required by the standard
that the Company uses to measure fair value are summarized below.


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

·

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities.

·

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than Level 1
prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related
assets or liabilities.

·

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that are supported by
little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
assets or liabilities.

ASC 820 requires the use
of observable market inputs (quoted market prices) when measuring fair value
and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever
possible.

The
following tables present the fair value of the Company’s financial assets
recorded at fair value on a recurring basis segregated among the appropriate
levels within the fair value hierarchy, at December 31, 2009 and 2008:


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

The
following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company’s
Level 3 financial assets as of December 31, 2009:

The Company’s Level 3 assets are comprised of
municipal or educational related or other public body notes with an auction
reset feature (“auction rate securities”). The majority of these notes carry an
investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various
federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest
rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days.
Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an
auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions.  During the years ended December 31, 2009
and 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. The auction
failures have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand
and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. In the event
that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some
cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that may be above
market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed
will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined rates and
be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds,
the issuer calls the securities, they mature or the Company is able to sell the
securities to third parties. As a result, the Company’s ability to liquidate
and fully recover the carrying value of its auction rate securities in the near
term may be limited. Consequently, these securities, except those that were
redeemed at par after December 31, 2009 and 2008, are classified as
long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At December 31,
2009, the Company held auction rate securities with a face value of $96.4
million (amortized cost basis of $92.0 million). A Level 3 valuation was
performed on the Company’s auction rate securities as of December 31,
2009, which indicated an impairment of $12.1 million, a decrease of $2.8
million from $14.9 million as of December 31, 2008, resulting in a fair
value of $84.3 million, which is included in short- and long-term investments.
This valuation utilized a mark-to-model approach which included estimates for
interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums,
and expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions
are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and
market conditions evolve.

On April 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC
320-10-65 which indicates that an other-than-temporary impairment must be
recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt
security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to
sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.  However, even if an investor does not expect
to sell a debt security, it must evaluate expected cash flows to be received
and determine if a Credit Loss has occurred. In the event of a Credit Loss and
absent the intent or requirement to sell a debt security before recovery of its
amortized cost, only the amount associated with the Credit Loss is recognized
as a loss in the income statement. The amount of loss relating to other factors
is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive


HANSEN NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

loss.
ASC 320-10-65 also requires additional disclosures regarding the calculation of
the Credit Loss and the factors considered in reaching a conclusion that an
investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired.

The
Company determined that of the $12.1 million impairment of its auction rate
securities at December 31, 2009, $7.7 million was temporary and $4.4
million was other-than-temporary.  The
other-than-temporary impairment was deemed Credit Loss related. The Company
recorded $3.9 million and $0.5 million of other-than-temporary impairment that
was deemed Credit Loss related through earnings during the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, $7.7 million of
temporary impairment has been recorded, less a tax benefit of $3.1 million, as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The factors evaluated to
differentiate between temporary impairment and other-than-temporary impairment
included the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and
assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as the
other factors included in the valuation model for debt securities described
above.

Based
on the Company’s ability to access cash and cash equivalents and other
short-term investments and based on the Company’s expected operating cash
flows, the Company does not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these
investments will have a material effect on its liquidity or working capital. If
uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings
downgrades on the auction rate securities held by the Company, the Company may
be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments.

DEBT

HBC
has a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving
line of credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the
amended provisions of the credit facility, HBC increased its available
borrowings under the revolving line of credit to $10.0 million of
non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1,
2010.  Interest on borrowings under the
line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or
varying London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”) up to 180 days, plus an
additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios
maintained by HBC. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on this line of
credit at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Letters of credit issued on behalf
of the Company totaling $0.2 million and $0.3 million under this credit facility
were outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The terms of the Company’s line of credit contain
certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. The Company
was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2009.

If any
event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary,
Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit
immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them,
including instituting legal proceedings.

Debt consists of the
following at December 31:

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the assets acquired under capital leases had a
net book value of $2.5 million and $2.7 million, net of accumulated
depreciation of $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively.

Interest expense, including amounts for capital
lease obligations, amounted to $0.05 million, $0.04 million and $0.05 million
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

million and 3.9 million shares, respectively, of common stock at an average
purchase price of $33.10 per share and $26.77 per share, respectively, which
the Company holds in treasury. No shares were purchased during the year ended December 31,

ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is presented below (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, options outstanding totaling 2.5 million shares, 1.4 million shares and
0.2 million shares respectively, were excluded from the calculations as their
effect would have been antidilutive.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating Leases

– In October 2006, the Company
entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which the Company leased 346,495
square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California.
This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months,
commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental
payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the
lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. This warehouse and
distribution space replaced the Company’s previous warehouse and distribution
space also located in Corona, California. In September 2007, the Company
relocated its corporate offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California.
The Company has sublet a small portion of its previous office, warehouse and
distribution space on a month to month basis. In addition, the Company
continues

to utilize the remaining portion of this space as
overflow for its main warehouse. This lease expires in October 2010.

The Company also rents additional warehouse space on a
short-term basis from time to time in the countries in which it operates.

Rent expense was $3.8 million, $3.5 million and $3.3
million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Future minimum rental payments at December 31,
2009 under the operating leases referred to above are as follows:

Purchase Commitments

– The Company has purchase commitments aggregating
approximately $42.2 million, which represent commitments made by the Company
and its subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the
manufacturing and packaging of its products. These obligations vary in terms.

In
addition to the above purchase obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement
between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”), the Company has
undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce re-sealable aluminum
beverage cans through December 31, 2010. The Company’s minimum purchase
obligation under this agreement is approximately $27.3 million, subject to
compliance by Rexam with certain conditions.

In
2008, the Company entered into licensing and programming agreements with SAP
America, Inc. to use its global enterprise resource planning software
initiative to replace the Company’s existing legacy software in North
America. The Company also entered into agreements with Axon Solutions, Inc.
and Vistex Inc. for the implementation and configuration of the SAP software.
As of January 2010, the Company had completed its North American transition to
the SAP enterprise resource planning system. The Company intends to complete
its transition for the Company’s international operations within fiscal 2010.
The Company estimates the remaining cost for implementation of the initiative
will be approximately $0.8 million.

The Company purchases various raw material items, including, but not
limited to, flavors, ingredients, containers, milk and cream, from a limited
number of resources.  An interruption in
supply from any of such resources could result in the Company’s inability to
produce certain products for limited or possibly extended periods of time. The
aggregate value of purchases from suppliers of such limited resources described
above for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $168.6
million, $116.2 million and $107.1 million, respectively.

Noncancelable contractual obligations

– The Company has noncancelable contractual
obligations aggregating approximately $51.2 million related primarily to
sponsorships and other commitments, payable over four years.

Licensing Agreements

– The Company produces, sells and distributes Lost® Energy

TM

drinks under an exclusive
license with Lost International LLC. The license agreement requires certain
royalty payments to be made related to the sale of Lost® brand products.
Royalty expense under this agreement for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $0.1 million, $0.3 million, and $0.5 million,
respectively.

Guarantees

– The Company from time to time enters into certain
types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties
against third party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) certain
agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and employees under which the
Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out
of their employment relationship, (ii) certain distribution or purchase
agreements under which the Company may have to indemnify the Company’s
customers from any claim, liability or loss arising out of any actual or
alleged injury or damages suffered in connection with the consumption or
purchase of the Company’s products, and (iii) certain real estate leases,
under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for
liabilities and other claims arising from the Company’s use of the applicable
premises. The terms of such obligations vary and typically, a maximum
obligation is not explicitly stated. Generally, the Company believes that its
insurance coverage is adequate to cover any resulting liabilities or claims.
Consequently, the Company does not believe the fair value of these guarantees
is material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Litigation

– In September 2006, Christopher
Chavez purporting to act on behalf of himself and a class of consumers yet to
be defined filed an action in the Superior Court of the State of California,
City and County of San Francisco, against the Company and its subsidiaries for
unfair business practices, false advertising, violation of California Consumers
Legal Remedies Act, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation alleging that the
Company misleadingly labels its Blue Sky beverages as manufactured and
canned/bottled wholly in Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
Defendants removed this Superior Court action to the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California under the Class Action
Fairness Act, and filed motions for dismissal or transfer.  On June 11, 2007, the United States
District Court, Northern District of California granted the Company’s motion to
dismiss Chavez’s complaint with prejudice. On June 23, 2009, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit filed a memorandum opinion
reversing the opinion of the United States District Court and remanded the case
to the United States District Court for further proceedings.  A class certification hearing is scheduled
for March 2010. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the Consumer
Legal Remedies Act claims that is set for hearing on March 4, 2010.  Chavez has filed a motion for a decision on a
preemption issue that will be heard on the same day.  The Company believes it has meritorious
defenses to the allegations and plans a vigorous defense.  Discovery has just begun.

On July 11,
2008, the Company initiated an action against Citigroup Inc., Citigroup Global
Markets, Inc., and Citi Smith Barney, in the United States District Court,
Central District of California, for violations of federal securities laws and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, arising out of the Company’s
purchase of auction rate securities.  The
Court granted the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration before the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). 
The matter is now proceeding before FINRA and has been set for hearing
in March 2010.

On August 28,
2008, the Company initiated an action against Oppenheimer Holdings Inc.,
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., and Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc., in the
United States District Court,

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

Central District of
California, for violations of federal securities laws and the Investment
Advisors Act, arising out of the Company’s purchase of auction rate
securities.  The defendants answered the
complaint on October 14, 2008 denying the allegations set forth
therein.  The Oppenheimer action was
deemed a related case to the Company’s action against Citigroup Inc. (described
above).  After the Court granted the
defendants’ motion to compel arbitration in the Citigroup Inc. case, the
Company stipulated to arbitration before FINRA, where the matter is now
proceeding and has been set for hearing in August, 2010.  The Company has voluntarily dismissed,
without prejudice, its claims against Oppenheimer Asset Management, Inc.  The Panel denied Oppenheimer Holdings, Inc.’s
motion to be dismissed from the proceeding.

In May 2009,
Avraham Wellman, purporting to act on behalf of himself and a class of
consumers in Canada, filed a putative class action in the Ontario Superior
Court of Justice, in the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, against the Company
and its former Canadian distributor, Pepsi-Cola Canada Ltd., as defendants.  The plaintiff alleges that the defendants
misleadingly packaged and labeled Monster Energy® products in Canada by not
including sufficiently specific statements with respect to contra-indications
and/or adverse reactions associated with the consumption of the energy drink
products.  The plaintiff’s claims against
the defendants are for negligence, unjust enrichment, and making
misleading/false representations in violation of the Competition Act (Canada),
the Food and Drugs Act (Canada) and the Consumer Protection Act, 2002
(Ontario).  The plaintiff claims general
damages on behalf of the putative class in the amount of CDN$20 million,
together with punitive damages of CDN$5 million, plus legal costs and interest.
The plaintiff’s certification motion materials have not yet been filed.  In accordance with class action practice in
Ontario, the Company will not file an answer to the complaint until after the
determination of the certification motion. 
The Company believes that the plaintiff’s complaint is without merit and
plans a vigorous defense.

In
addition to the above matters, the Company is subject to litigation from time
to time in the normal course of business, including claims from terminated
distributors.  Although it is not
possible to predict the outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to
the Company and after consultation with counsel, management believes that such
litigation in the aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Securities
Litigation

- On September 11,
2008, a federal securities class action complaint styled

Cunha v.
Hansen Natural Corp., et al.

was filed in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California (the “District Court”). On September 17,
2008, a second federal securities class action complaint styled

Brown v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al.

was also filed in the
District Court.

On July 14,
2009, the Court entered an order consolidating the actions and appointing lead
counsel and the Structural Ironworkers Local Union #1 Pension Fund as lead
plaintiff.  On August 28, 2009 lead
plaintiff filed a Consolidated Complaint for Violations of Federal Securities
Laws (the “Consolidated Class Action Complaint”).  The Consolidated Class Action Complaint
purports to be brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of the Company’s
stock during the period November 9, 2006 through November 8, 2007
(the “Class Period”).  It names as
defendants the Company, Rodney C. Sacks, Hilton H. Schlosberg, and Thomas J.
Kelly.  Plaintiff principally alleges
that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false and misleading
statements relating to the Company’s distribution coordination agreements with
Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (“AB”) and its sales of “Allied” energy drink lines,
and engaged in sales of shares in the Company on the basis of material
non-public information.  Plaintiff also
alleges that the Company’s financial statements for the second quarter of 2007
did not include certain promotional expenses. 
The Consolidated Class Action Complaint alleges violations of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and
seeks an unspecified amount of damages.

On November 16,
2009, the defendants filed their motion to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action
Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and
9(b), as well as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.  On January 8, 2010, lead plaintiff filed
its opposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss.  Defendants’ reply brief was filed on February 8,
2010 and the Company is awaiting a decision from the Court on the motion.

Derivative
Litigation

— On October 15,
2008, a derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California (the “District Court”), styled

Merckel v. Sacks, et al

. 
On November 17, 2008, a second derivative complaint styled

Dislevy v. Sacks, et al.

was also filed in the District
Court.  The derivative suits were each
brought, purportedly on behalf of the Company, by a shareholder of the Company
who made no prior demand on the Company’s Board of Directors.

On June 29,
2009, the Court entered an order consolidating the Merckel and Dislevy
actions.  On July 13, 2009, the
Court entered an order re-styling the consolidated actions as

In re Hansen Derivative Shareholder Litigation

, appointing
lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and establishing a schedule for the filing of
a consolidated amended complaint and for defendants’ response to such
complaint.

On October 13,
2009, lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (the
“Consolidated Derivative Complaint”). 
The Consolidated Derivative Complaint names as defendants certain
current and former officers, directors, and employees of the Company, including
Rodney C. Sacks, Hilton H. Schlosberg, Harold C. Taber, Jr., Benjamin M.
Polk, Norman C. Epstein, Mark S. Vidergauz, Sydney Selati, Thomas J. Kelly,
Mark J. Hall, and Kirk S. Blower, as well as Hilrod Holdings, L.P.  The Company is named as a nominal defendant.  The factual allegations of the Consolidated
Derivative Complaint are similar to those set forth in the Consolidated Class Action
Complaint described above.  Plaintiff
alleges that, from November 2006 to the present, the defendants caused the
Company to issue false and misleading statements concerning its business
prospects and failed to properly disclose problems related to its non-Monster
energy drinks, the prospects for the Anheuser-Busch distribution relationship,
and alleged “inventory loading” that affected the Company’s results for the
second quarter of 2007.  Plaintiff
further alleges that while the Company’s shares were purportedly artificially
inflated because of those improper statements, certain of the defendants sold
Company stock while in possession of material non-public information. The
Consolidated Derivative Complaint asserts various causes of action, including
breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,
violation of Cal. Corp. Code §§ 25402 and 25403 for insider selling, and unjust
enrichment. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of damages to be paid to the
Company and adoption of corporate governance reforms, among other things.

On January 8,
2010, the Company filed its motion to dismiss the Consolidated Derivative
Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and
23.1.  Plaintiff’s opposition to the
motion was filed on February 22, 2010, and the Company’s reply brief is
required to be filed by March 15, 2010. 
None of the other defendants need answer, move to dismiss, or otherwise
respond to the Consolidated Derivative Complaint until or unless the District
Court orders the Company to file an answer, in which case the other defendants
will have 45 days after the filing of the Company’s answer to move to dismiss
or otherwise respond to the Consolidated Derivative Complaint.

Although the
ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, the
Company believes that the allegations in the Consolidated Class Action
Complaint and the Consolidated Derivative Complaint are without merit. The
Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The
Company has two stock option plans under which shares were available for grant
at December 31, 2009: the Hansen Natural Corporation Amended and Restated
2001 Stock Option Plan (the “2001 Option Plan”) and the 2009 Hansen Natural
Corporation Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2009
Directors Plan”). The 2009 Directors Plan, which replaced the 2005 Hansen
Natural Corporation Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2005
Directors Plan”), was approved by the Board of Directors on April 13,
2009, and ratified by the stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting of
stockholders, held on June 4, 2009.

The
2001 Option Plan permits the granting of options to purchase up to 22,000,000
shares of the common stock of the Company to certain key employees or
non-employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options granted under the
2001 Option Plan may be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code, as amended, non-qualified stock options or stock
appreciation rights. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation
Committee”) has sole and exclusive authority to grant stock option awards to
all employees who are not new hires and to all new hires who are subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee and the Executive Committee of
the Board of Directors (the “Executive Committee”) each independently has the
authority to grant awards to new hires who are not Section 16 employees.
Awards granted by the Executive Committee are not subject to approval or
ratification by the Board or the Compensation Committee. Outstanding options
under the 2001 Option Plan generally vest over five years from the grant date
and are generally exercisable up to 10 years after the grant date. As of December 31,
2009, options to purchase 18,587,300 shares of the Company’s common stock had
been granted, net of cancellations, and options to purchase 3,412,700 shares of
the Company’s common stock remain available for grant under the 2001 Option
Plan.

The
2009 Directors Plan permits the granting of options, stock appreciation rights
(each, an “SAR”), and other stock-based awards to purchase up to an aggregate of
800,000 shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee directors of the
Company. The 2009 Directors Plan is administered by the Board of Directors.
Each award granted under the 2009 Directors Plan will be evidenced by a written
agreement and will contain the terms and conditions that the Board of Directors
deems appropriate. The Board of Directors may grant such awards on the last
business day prior to the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. Any award
granted under the 2009 Directors Plan will vest, with respect to 100% of such
award, on the last business day prior to the date of the annual meeting, in the
calendar year following the calendar year in which such award is granted. The
Board of Directors may determine the exercise price per share of the Company’s
common stock under each option, but such price may not be less than 100% of the
closing price of the Company’s common stock for one share on the date an option
is granted. Option grants may be made under the 2009 Directors Plan for 10 years
from June 4, 2009. The Board of Directors may also grant SARs,
independently, or in connection with an option grant. The Board of Directors
may determine the exercise price per share of the Company’s common stock under
each SAR, but such price may not be less than the greater of (i) the fair
market value of a share on the date the SAR is granted and (ii) the price
of the related option, if the SAR is granted in connection with an option
grant. Additionally, the Board of Directors may grant other stock-based awards,
which include awards of shares of the Company’s common stock, restricted shares
of the Company’s common stock, and awards that are valued based on the fair
market value of shares of the Company’s common stock. SARs and other
stock-based awards are subject to the general provisions of the 2009 Directors
Plan. The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2009 Directors Plan at
any time. As of December 31, 2009, no options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock had been granted under the 2009 Directors Plan, and
options to purchase 800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock remained
available for grant.

NATURAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

The 2005 Directors Plan, which was replaced
by the 2009 Directors Plan, permitted the granting of options to purchase up to
an aggregate of 800,000 shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee
directors of the Company. On the date of the annual meeting of stockholders at
which an eligible director was initially elected, each eligible director was
entitled to receive a one-time grant of an option to purchase 24,000 shares of
the Company’s common stock exercisable at the closing price for a share of
common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, on the fifth anniversary of
the election of eligible directors elected or appointed to the Board of
Directors, and each fifth anniversary thereafter, each eligible director was to
receive an additional grant of an option to purchase 19,200 shares of the
Company’s common stock. Options became exercisable in four equal installments,
with the grant immediately vested with respect to 25% of the grant and the
remaining installments vesting on the three successive anniversaries of the
date of grant; provided that all options held by an eligible director became
fully and immediately exercisable upon a change in control of the Company.
Options granted under the 2005 Directors Plan that were not exercised generally
expired 10 years after the date of grant. Option grants could be made under the
2005 Directors Plan for 10 years from the effective date of the 2005 Directors
Plan. The 2005 Directors Plan was a “formula plan” so that a non-employee
director’s participation in the 2005 Directors Plan did not affect his status
as a “disinterested person” (as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange
Act). As of December 31, 2009, options to purchase 76,800 shares of the
Company’s common stock had been granted under the 2005 Directors Plan.

Under
the Company’s stock option plans, all grants are made at prices based on the
fair-value of the options on the date of grant. The Company recorded $14.0
million, $13.9 million and $10.2 million of compensation expense relating to
outstanding options during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.  Refer to “Change in
Estimated Forfeiture Rate” within this Note 12 for additional information.

The Company records compensation
expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the
options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company records compensation
expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the
options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for
performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached, and (2) the
date at which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the assumptions included in
the table below. The Company uses historical data to determine the exercise
behavior, volatility and forfeiture rate of the options. The following
weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options
granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively:

Expected Volatility:

The Company uses historical volatility as it provides
a reasonable estimate of the expected volatility. Historical volatility is
based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a period of time
equivalent to the expected term of the option.

Risk-Free Interest Rate

: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury zero coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the
expected term of the option.

Expected Term:

The Company’s expected term represents the
weighted-average period that the Company’s stock options are expected to be
outstanding. The expected term is based on expected time to post-vesting
exercise of options by employees. The Company uses historical exercise patterns
of previously granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to
forecast expected exercise patterns.

The following table summarizes the Company’s
activities with respect to its stock option plans as follows:

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $21.41 per share,
$18.42 per share and $24.06 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic value
of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007 was $13.0 million, $29.7 million and $133.1 million, respectively.

Cash received from option exercises under all plans for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $2.5 million, $2.3
million and $8.0 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for tax
deductions from non-qualified stock option exercises and disqualifying
dispositions of incentive stock options for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $3.1 million, $4.3 million and $29.4 million,
respectively.

At December 31, 2009, there was $47.6 million of
total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested shares granted to
both employees and non-employees under the Company’s share-based payment plans.
That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9
years.

Change in Estimated Forfeiture Rate

During the year ended December 31, 2009, based on
historical experience, the Company modified the estimated annual forfeiture
rate used in recognizing stock-based compensation expense for its most senior
executives based on their dissimilar historical forfeiture experience as
compared to the forfeiture experience for non-senior executives. This
modification resulted in a change from a 3.0% forfeiture rate for all employees
to a 0% forfeiture rate for senior executives and an 11.2% forfeiture rate for
all other recipients. During the same period, the Company also realized a
benefit from actual forfeiture experience that was higher than previously
estimated for unvested stock options, resulting primarily from non-senior
executives and other employee departures from the Company. The cumulative
impact of the revised forfeiture rates reduced stock-based compensation expense
by approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

A valuation allowance is required to be provided to reduce the deferred
tax assets to a level which, more likely than not, will be realized. The
Company’s net deferred tax assets were not reduced by tax valuation allowances
at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Management evaluated the positive and
negative evidence in determining the realizability of the net deferred tax
assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and concluded it is more likely than
not that the Company should realize its net deferred tax assets through future
operating results and the reversal of taxable temporary differences.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, the
Company had approximately $0.04 million in interest and penalties related to
recognized tax benefits accrued. In addition, $0.1 million of benefit was
recognized through the provision for income taxes during the year ended December 31,
2009. It is not expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will
change in the next 12 months; however, the Company does not expect the change
to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or
