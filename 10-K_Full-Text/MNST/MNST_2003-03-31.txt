ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Overview

     Hansen Natural  Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1990.
Its principal place of business is at 1010 Railroad Street,  Corona,  California
92882 and its  telephone  number is (909)  739-6200.  When this  report uses the
words "Hansen",  "HBC", "the Company",  "we", "us", and "our", these words refer
to Hansen Natural  Corporation and our  subsidiaries  other than Hard e Beverage
Company ("HEB"), unless the context otherwise requires.

     We are a holding company and carry on no operating  business except through
our direct wholly owned subsidiaries,  Hansen Beverage Company ("HBC") which was
incorporated  in  Delaware  on June 8, 1992 and HEB which  was  incorporated  in
Delaware on April 30, 1990.  HBC  generates  substantially  all of our operating
revenues.

Corporate History

     In the 1930's,  Hubert Hansen and his three sons started a business to sell
fresh  non-pasteurized  juices  in  Los  Angeles,   California.   This  business
eventually became Hansen's Juices,  Inc., which subsequently became known as The
Fresh Juice  Company of  California,  Inc.  ("FJC").  FJC  retained the right to
market and sell fresh  non-pasteurized  juices  under the Hansen  trademark.  In
1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen,  perceived a demand for
pasteurized  natural  juices and juice  blends that are shelf  stable and formed
Hansen Foods, Inc. ("HFI"). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include
Hansen's(R)  Natural Sodas.  California  Co-Packers  Corporation  (d/b/a/ Hansen
Beverage Company) ("CCC") acquired certain assets of HFI, including the right to
market the  Hansen's(R)  brand name,  in January  1990.  On July 27,  1992,  HBC
acquired the  Hansen's(R)  brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC.
Under our ownership, the Hansen beverage business has significantly expanded and
currently  includes a wide range of beverages  within the growing  "alternative"
beverage   category.   As  will  appear  more  fully  from  the  section  headed
"Intellectual Property" below, in September 1999 we acquired all of FJC's rights
to manufacture,  sell and distribute fresh  non-pasteurized juice products under
the Hansen's(R) trademark together with certain additional rights. In 2000, HBC,
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co. ("Blue Sky"),
which was  incorporated  in Delaware on September 8, 2000,  acquired the natural
soda  business  previously  conducted  by Blue Sky Natural  Beverage  Co., a New
Mexico  corporation  ("BSNBC"),  under the Blue Sky(R) trademark.  In 2001, HBC,
through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  Hansen  Junior  Juice  Company,  ("Junior
Juice"),  which was incorporated in Delaware on May 7, 2001, acquired the Junior
Juice business  previously  conducted by Pasco Juices,  Inc. ("Pasco") under the
Junior Juice(R) trademark.

Industry Overview

     The alternative  beverage category combines  non-carbonated  ready-to-drink
iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single serve juices,  ready-to-drink iced
coffees,  energy drinks,  sports drinks, soy drinks and single-serve still water
(flavored and  unflavored)  with "new age"  beverages,  including sodas that are
considered  natural,   sparkling  juices  and  flavored  sparkling  waters.  The
alternative  beverage  category is the fastest  growing  segment of the beverage
marketplace according to Beverage Marketing  Corporation.  Sales in 2002 for the
alternative beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $13.2
billion at wholesale,  representing a growth rate of approximately  13% over the
estimated wholesale sales in 2001 of $11.7 billion.  (Source: Beverage Marketing
Corporation).



Products

     We market,  sell and distribute  "alternative"  beverage  category  natural
sodas, fruit juices, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice and soy
smoothies,    "functional   drinks",   sparkling   lemonades   and   orangeades,
non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails,  children's
multi-vitamin  juice drinks and  non-carbonated  lightly  flavored energy waters
under the  Hansen's(R)  brand name. We also market,  sell and distribute  energy
drinks under the Monster(TM)  brand name. In addition,  we market nutrition bars
and  cereals  under  the  Hansen's(R)  brand  name.  We also  market,  sell  and
distribute,  natural  sodas,  premium  natural sodas with  supplements,  organic
natural  sodas,  seltzer  waters and energy  drinks  under the Blue Sky(R) brand
name. Our fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under the Junior Juice(R) brand
name. Our malt-based drinks are marketed under the Hard e(TM) brand name.

     Natural  Sodas.  Hansen's  natural  sodas have been a leading  natural soda
brand in  Southern  California  for the past 25  years.  In 2002,  according  to
Information Resources, Inc.'s Analyzer Reports for California, our natural sodas
recorded  the  highest  sales  among  comparable  carbonated  new  age  category
beverages  measured by unit volume in the California  market.  Our natural sodas
are currently available in thirteen regular flavors consisting of mandarin lime,
key lime, grapefruit,  raspberry, creamy root beer, vanilla cola, cherry vanilla
creme, orange mango, kiwi strawberry, tropical passion, black cherry, ginger ale
and  tangerine.  In early  2001,  we  introduced  a new line of diet sodas using
Splenda(R) sweetener as the primary sweetener. We initially introduced this line
in four flavors:  peach,  black cherry,  tangerine lime, and kiwi strawberry and
have since added a fifth  flavor,  ginger  ale.  Our  natural  sodas  contain no
preservatives,  sodium,  caffeine or artificial  coloring and are made with high
quality  natural  flavors,  citric acid and high  fructose corn syrup or, in the
case of diet sodas,  with  Splenda(R) and  Acesulfame-K.  We package our natural
sodas in 12-ounce aluminum cans. In 2002, we introduced a line of natural mixers
in 8-ounce aluminum cans comprising club soda, tonic water and ginger ale.

     In January 1999, we introduced a premium line of Signature  Sodas in unique
proprietary 14-ounce glass bottles. This line was marketed under the Hansen's(R)
brand name,  primarily through our distributor network, in six flavors. In early
2003 we  repositioned  this line into lower cost  12-ounce  glass  packaging and
intend to market our  repositioned  Signature  Soda line at lower  price  points
directly to our retail customers such as grocery chains, club stores,  specialty
retail  chains and mass  merchandisers  and to the health  food  sector  through
specialty health food  distributors ( hereinafter  together referred to as our "
direct  retail  customers " ).  Signature  Soda is available  in 12-ounce  glass
bottles in five flavors:  orange creme, vanilla creme, ginger beer, sarsaparilla
and black cherry.

     In September  2000,  we acquired the Blue Sky Natural  Soda  business  from
BSNBC. Our Blue Sky product line comprises natural sodas, premium sodas, organic
natural sodas,  seltzer water and energy  drinks.  Blue Sky(R) natural sodas are
available in thirteen  regular  flavors  consisting  of lemon lime,  grapefruit,
cola, root beer, raspberry,  cherry vanilla creme, truly orange, Jamaican ginger
ale, black cherry,  orange creme,  Dr. Becker,  grape and private  reserve cream
soda. We also offer a Blue Sky(R) product line of premium line of natural sodas,
which contain  supplements such as ginseng.  This line is currently available in
six flavors  consisting  of ginseng  creme,  ginseng  cola,  ginseng  root beer,
ginseng very berry creme,  ginseng ginger ale, and ginseng  cranberry-raspberry.
During 1999, Blue Sky(R)  introduced a line of organic natural sodas,  which are
currently  available in six flavors  consisting of prime lime cream, new century
cola, orange divine,  ginger gale, black cherry cherish,  and root beer. We also
market a seltzer  water under the Blue Sky(R) label in three  flavors:  natural,
lime and lemon.  In 2002, we introduced a lightly  carbonated Blue Sky(R) energy
drink  in  an  8.3-ounce  slim  can.  The  Blue  Sky(R)   products   contain  no
preservatives,  sodium or caffeine  (other than in the case of the energy drink)
or  artificial  coloring and are made with high quality  natural  flavors.  Blue
Sky(R)  natural  sodas and  seltzer  waters are  currently  packaged in 12-ounce
aluminum cans and are marketed primarily to our direct retail customers.

     In 2001, we introduced a new line of sparkling lemonades (regular and pink)
and orangeades in unique  proprietary  1-liter glass bottles and towards the end
of 2002, we  introduced  diet  versions of our regular  sparkling  lemonades and
orangeades,   also  in  1-liter  glass  bottles.  The  sparkling  lemonades  and
orangeades  contain  real juice and pulp.  In 2003,  we plan to extend this line
into unique  proprietary  12-ounce  glass  bottles.  This  product  line will be
marketed to our direct retail customers.



     Hansen's Energy Drinks. In 1997, we introduced a lightly  carbonated citrus
flavored Hansen's(R) energy drink. Our energy drink competes in the "functional"
beverage category, namely, beverages that provide a real or perceived benefit in
addition to simply delivering  refreshment.  We currently offer our energy drink
in three  versions:  original  citrus,  tropical  and wild berry.  We also offer
additional  functional drinks including a ginger flavored  d-stress(R) drink, an
orange flavored b-well(TM) drink, and a guarana berry flavored stamina(R) drink,
a grape flavor power drink, and a  berry-flavored  slim down drink that contains
no  calories.  Each  of our  energy  and  functional  drinks  contain  different
combinations   of  vitamins,   minerals,   nutrients,   herbs  and   supplements
("supplements").  Our energy drinks and functional  drinks are sold in 8.3-ounce
cans and bottles. In 2001, we introduced  Energade(R),  a non-carbonated  Energy
sports  drink  in  23.5-ounce  cans  in two  flavors,  citrus  and  orange,  and
subsequently  introduced a third  flavor,  red rocker.  We also  introduced  E2O
Energy  Water(TM),  a  non-carbonated  lightly  flavored water, in 24-ounce blue
polyethylene   terephthalate   ("P.E.T.")  plastic  bottles,  in  four  flavors,
tangerine,  apple,  berry and lemon.  In 2002,  we expanded our E2O Energy Water
line with four additional flavors in clear P.E.T. plastic bottles,  mango melon,
kiwi  strawberry,  grapefruit  and green  tea.  Our  Energade(R)  and E2O Energy
Water(TM) drinks also contain different  combinations and levels of supplements.
At the end of 2002,  we  introduced  a lightly  carbonated  diet energy drink in
8.3-ounce  cans under the  Hansen's(R)  Diet Red brand name. Our Diet Red energy
drink is sweetened with Splenda and Acesulfame-K. We market our energy, Diet Red
energy,  Energade and E2O Energy Water drinks in clear bottles  through our full
service  distributor  network.  We market  our E2O Energy  Water  drinks in blue
bottles to our direct retail customers.

     Monster Energy Drinks. In 2002, we launched a new lightly carbonated energy
drink under the  Monster(TM)  brand  name,  in a 16-ounce  can,  which is almost
double the size of our  regular  energy  drinks in  8.3-ounce  cans and the vast
majority of competitive  energy drinks currently on the market.  Our Monster(TM)
brand energy drink contains  different types and levels of supplements  than our
Hansen's(R)  energy drinks and is marketed through our full service  distributor
network.

     Juice  Products  and  Smoothies.  Our fruit  juice  product  line  includes
Hansen's(R)  Natural  Old  Fashioned  Apple  Juice which is packaged in 64-ounce
P.E.T. plastic bottles and 128-ounce polypropylene bottles and Apple Strawberry,
Apple Grape and Apple Cranberry juice blends in 64-ounce P.E.T. plastic bottles.
These Hansen's(R) juice products contain 100% juice as well as 100% (120% in the
case of Apple  Juice) of the  recommended  daily intake for adults of Vitamin C.
Certain of these products also contain added calcium. We also market a Cranberry
juice  cocktail  and an  Orange-Carrot  juice blend in 64-ounce  P.E.T.  plastic
bottles.  These products do not contain 100% juice.  Hansen's(R)  juice products
compete in the shelf-stable juice category. In 2002, we extended our fruit juice
and juice  blend  product  line by  introducing  certain  of these  products  in
10-ounce P.E.T. plastic bottles.

     In March  1995,  we  introduced  a line of fruit juice  smoothie  drinks in
11.5-ounce aluminum cans. Certain flavors were subsequently offered in glass and
P.E.T.  plastic  bottles.  Hansen's fruit juice  smoothies have a smooth texture
that is thick  but  lighter  than a nectar.  Hansen's  smoothies  in  11.5-ounce
aluminum cans contain approximately 35% juice while the juice levels of Hansen's
smoothies in glass and P.E.T.  plastic bottles is 25%. Our fruit juice smoothies
provide 100% of the recommended daily intake for adults of Vitamins A, C & E and
represented Hansen's entry into what is commonly referred to as the "functional"
beverage  category.  Hansen's(R)  fruit  juice  smoothies  are  available  in 15
flavors:  strawberry  banana,  peach berry,  mango pineapple,  guava strawberry,
pineapple coconut,  apricot nectar, tropical passion,  whipped orange, cranberry
twist, a cranberry  raspberry lite as well as the blast line  comprising  Island
Blast, Colada Blast, Power Berry Blast, Vita Blast and Banana Blast.

     In 2001,  we introduced a new line of soy smoothies in 1-liter and 11-ounce
aseptic packaging in five flavors: berry splash,  tropical breeze, orange dream,
lemon chiffon and peach passion. The soy smoothies contain soy protein and fruit
juices. In 2002 we introduced a 100% sparkling apple cider in a magnum 1.5-liter
glass bottle.

     The above  juice and  smoothie  products  are being  marketed to our direct
retail customers.



     Healthy Start Product Line.  During the second quarter of 1998, we launched
our first Healthy  Start(TM) 100% juice product.  We  subsequently  expanded the
line and entered into a licensing  agreement  with the Silver  Foxes  network in
connection therewith. We also launched a Healthy Start 100% juice line in single
serve glass  bottles.  Sales were  disappointing  and we have  discontinued  the
entire line.

     Iced  Teas,  Lemonades  and  Juice  Cocktails.  We  introduced  Hansen's(R)
ready-to-drink iced teas and lemonades in 1993. Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink iced
teas are currently  available in three  flavors:  Original with Lemon,  Tropical
Peach and Wildberry.  Lemonades are currently available in one flavor:  Original
Old Fashioned Lemonade.  Hansen's(R) juice cocktails were introduced in 1994 and
are currently  available in three  flavors:  kiwi  strawberry  melon,  tangerine
pineapple with passion fruit,  and California  paradise  punch.  We introduced a
variety 12 pack of iced teas  during the first half of 2001,  which  experienced
limited  success.  We  are  continuing  to  market  this  package.   Hansen's(R)
ready-to-drink  iced  teas,  lemonades  and juice  cocktails  were  packaged  in
16-ounce  wide-mouth  glass bottles.  At the end of 2002, we converted this line
from 16-ounce glass bottles to 16-ounce polypropylene bottles.

     Hansen's(R)  ready-to-drink  iced  teas are made  with  decaffeinated  tea.
Hansen's(R)  juice  products and smoothies are made with high quality juices and
products  that  contain  less than 100% fruit  juice are also made with  natural
flavors, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid and other ingredients.

     In 1999, we introduced a line of specialty  teas in 20-ounce glass bottles,
which  we named  our  "Gold  Standard"  line.  We  subsequently  introduced  two
additional  green tea  flavors as well as two diet green  flavors  and six juice
cocktails.  We are  discontinuing  certain of the specialty  teas and all of the
juice cocktails but are continuing to market three regular green tea flavors and
the diet peach green tea flavor.  Our Gold Standard  line contains  supplements,
but at lower levels than in our  functional  drinks.  We continue to package our
Gold Standard Line in unique  20-ounce glass bottles.  Additionally,  in 2002 we
introduced  two of our iced tea  products,  namely green tea and  original  with
lemon in 14-ounce aseptic packages.

     Medicine  Man Product  Line.  During  2001,  we launched a premium  line of
alternative  healthy iced teas and drinks under the  "Medicine  Man(R)" label in
proprietary glass bottles. Response from customers and consumers to the Medicine
Man(R) line was  disappointing  and, in consequence,  we have  discontinued this
line.

     Juices for Children.  In the third  quarter of 1999, we introduced  two new
lines of children's  multi-vitamin  juice drinks in 8.45-ounce aseptic packages.
Each drink contains eleven essential vitamins and six essential  minerals.  Each
line was introduced in and currently has three flavors. We introduce new flavors
in place of  existing  flavors  from  time to time.  One of these two lines is a
dual-branded  100%  juice line  named  "Juice  Blast(R)"  that was  launched  in
conjunction with Costco Wholesale Corporation  ("Costco") and is sold nationally
through  Costco  stores.  The  other  line was a 10%  juice  line  named  "Juice
Slam(TM)"  that  was  available  to  all  of  our  customers.  During  2000,  we
repositioned  that line as a 100% juice line under the Juice  Slam(TM)  name and
are currently  marketing that line to grocery store chain customers,  the health
food  trade,  and other  customers.  In 2002,  we changed  the size of the Juice
Blast(R) package to 6.75-ounces.

     In May 2001, we acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business.  The Junior
Juice(R)  product line is comprised of seven flavors of 100% juice in 4.23-ounce
aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. Six flavors of the Junior Juice(R)
line have  calcium  added and all  flavors  have  vitamin C added.  The  current
flavors in the Junior Juice(R) line are apple, apple berry,  orange twist, apple
grape, mixed fruit, fruit punch, and white grape.

     Nutrition  Bars. In 2000,  we introduced a new line of nutrition  food bars
under the  Hansen's(R)  brand name.  This line is made from grains and fruit. In
addition, we introduced a new line of premium G.M.O. free (free from genetically
modified  organisms)  cereals under the Hansen's(R) brand name. During the first
half of 2001, we  introduced a line of functional  food bars and towards the end
of the year  introduced a line of active  nutrition  bars,  which are  specially
formulated  for adults who are older than 50 years of age. Sales of the bars and
cereals  have been  disappointing  and we are  presently  evaluating  whether to
persist with or discontinue all or certain of these products.



     Hard e Product  Line.  During the third  quarter of 2000,  we  introduced a
malt-based  drink  under  the name Hard e,  which  contains  up to  five-percent
alcohol.  The Hard e product is not marketed under the Hansen's(R)  name.  Sales
from this product line are limited.

     Bottled Water.  Hansen's(R)  still water products were  introduced in 1993.
Hansen's(R) still water products are primarily sold in 0.5-liter plastic bottles
to the food service trade.

  Other Products

     We  continue to  evaluate  and,  where  considered  appropriate,  introduce
additional  flavors and other types of  beverages  to  complement  our  existing
product  lines.  We  will  also  evaluate,  and  where  considered  appropriate,
introduce  functional   foods/snack  foods  that  utilize  similar  channels  of
distribution  and/or are  complementary to our existing products and/or to which
the Hansen's(R) brand name is able to add value.

Manufacture and Distribution

     We do not  directly  manufacture  our products  but instead  outsource  the
manufacture to third party bottlers and packers.

     We purchase concentrates,  juices, flavors, vitamins, minerals,  nutrients,
herbs,  supplements,  caps,  labels,  trays, boxes and other ingredients for our
beverage  products  which are delivered to our various third party  bottlers and
packers.  Depending  on the  product  being  produced  by them,  the third party
bottlers or packers add filtered  water and/or high  fructose corn syrup or cane
sugar or Splenda  brand  sweetener,  Acesulfame-K  and/or  citric  acid or other
ingredients  and  supplements  for the manufacture and packaging of the finished
products into  approved  containers.  In the case of sodas and other  carbonated
beverages,  the  bottler/packer  adds carbonation to the products as part of the
production process.

     We are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase of and delivery
to our third party  bottlers and packers of the containers in which our beverage
products are packaged.

     The  ingredients  for our  nutrition  food bars,  functional  food bars and
active nutrition bars are purchased by our co-packers from various suppliers for
manufacturing  and  packaging  of the  finished  bars.  Our cereal  products are
manufactured for us by an overseas supplier who supplies all of the ingredients.

     All of our  beverage  products  are  manufactured  by various  third  party
bottlers  and packers  situated  throughout  the United  States and Canada under
separate   arrangements  with  each  of  such  parties.   The  majority  of  our
co-packaging arrangements are on a month to month basis except for our agreement
with Southwest Canning and Packaging,  Inc. ("Southwest") pursuant to a contract
under which Southwest packages  Hansen's(R) natural sodas and our agreement with
Hi-Country - Corona, Inc.  ("Hi-Country")  pursuant to which Hi-Country packages
Hansen's(R) apple juice in P.E.T. plastic bottles,  smoothies in 11.5-ounce cans
and energy drinks in 8.3 and 16-ounce  cans.  The Southwest  contract  continues
indefinitely  and is subject to  termination  upon 60 days  written  notice from
either party.  The  Hi-Country  contract  continues  until 2007,  but we are not
obliged  to  manufacture  all of our  requirements  or any  minimum  volumes  at
Hi-Country.  In  addition,  upon  termination  of the  Hi-Country  contract  for
whatever  reason,  we are entitled to remove all equipment that we purchased and
was installed at Hi-Country to enable them to manufacture our products.

     Hard e malt-based drinks are manufactured for HEB by Reflo, Inc. ("Reflo"),
pursuant to a  manufacturing  and  distribution  agreement dated as of March 23,
2000  ("Reflo  Agreement").  Either  party  may  elect to  terminate  the  Reflo
Agreement at any time on 90 days notice. Under the terms of the Reflo Agreement,
Reflo  administers the sales and  distribution  of such products  throughout the
United States,  excluding  Arizona,  California,  Nevada and Oregon where HEB is
itself  responsible for the sales and  distribution of such products.  Hard e is
currently  being  distributed  in 7  states.  However,  in many of such  states,
distribution is on an extremely limited scale.




     In many instances,  specific items of equipment are purchased by us and are
installed at the facilities of our packers to enable them to produce  certain of
our products on their lines. In general, such equipment remains our property and
is to be returned to us upon termination of the packing  arrangements  with such
packers.

     We pack certain of our  products  outside of the West Coast to enable us to
produce  products  closer to the markets where they are sold and thereby  reduce
freight costs. As volumes in markets outside of California  grow, we continue to
secure additional packing  arrangements closer to such markets to further reduce
freight costs.

     Our  ability  to  estimate  demand  is  imprecise,  particularly  with  new
products,  and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth,  particularly
in new markets.  If we materially  underestimate  demand for our products or are
unable to secure  sufficient  ingredients  or raw materials  including,  but not
limited  to,  glass,   P.E.T./plastic   bottles,  cans  or  labels,  or  packing
arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis.

     Although our  arrangements  for production of our products are generally of
short duration or are terminable upon request,  we believe a short disruption or
delay would not  significantly  affect our revenues  since  alternative  packing
facilities in the United  States with adequate  capacity can usually be obtained
for many of our  products  at  commercially  reasonable  rates  and/or  within a
reasonably short time period.  However,  there are limited packing facilities in
the United States with adequate  capacity and/or suitable  equipment for many of
our newer  products,  including  our  energy  drinks  and  functional  drinks in
8.3-ounce  cans,  Gold  Standard  line,  aseptic  juice  products,  Energade(R),
sparkling  apple  cider  in  1.5-liter  magnum  glass  bottles,  soy  smoothies,
Monster(TM) energy in 16-ounce cans and sparkling lemonades and orangeade lines.
There are also limited shrink sleeve labeling facilities available in the United
States with  adequate  capacity for our energy  drinks in glass  bottles and E2O
Energy Water.  A disruption or delay in production of any of such products could
significantly  affect our revenues from such products as alternative  co-packing
facilities in the United States with adequate  capacity may not be available for
such  products  either  at  commercially   reasonable  rates,  and/or  within  a
reasonably short time period, if at all. In addition,  with regard to the Hard e
product,  while there are many  co-packing  facilities in the United States with
adequate  capacity that could produce such product,  due to regulatory issues it
may not be  feasible  for such  product  to be packed at  alternative  packaging
facilities  on short  notice.  Consequently,  a disruption in production of such
products  could  affect our  revenues.  We continue to seek  alternative  and/or
additional  co-packing  facilities  in the United States or Canada with adequate
capacity for the production of its various  products to minimize the risk of any
disruption in production.

     We  have  entered  into   distribution   agreements  with  distributors  to
distribute Hansen's(R) energy drinks, Monster(TM) energy drinks, Diet Red energy
drinks,  Energade(R)  sports  drinks and E2O Energy Water in 49 states.  In many
states however, distribution is only on a limited scale. Certain of our products
are sold in Canada. We also sell a limited range of our products to distributors
outside of the United States, including the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Guam,
the Caribbean and the United Arab Emirates.

     We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into
agreements  with regional  bottlers or other direct store delivery  distributors
having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.  Many of our
bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture  and/or distribute
other soda and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products. In many cases,
such products compete directly with our products.

     We are  continuing  to take  steps to  reduce  our  inventory  levels in an
endeavor to lower our warehouse and distribution costs.




     During 2002, we continued to expand  distribution  of our natural sodas and
smoothies  outside of our traditional  California base. We expanded our national
sales force to support and grow sales,  primarily of Hansen's(R)  energy drinks,
Monster(TM)  energy drinks,  Diet Red energy drinks,  Energade(R)  energy sports
drinks and E2O Energy Water and we intend to build such sales force in 2003.  In
2002,  we appointed  Mr. Mike Schott as the Vice  President  of National  Sales,
Single Serve Products, with responsibility for the aforesaid products.

     Our Blue  Sky(R)  products  are sold  primarily  to the  health  food trade
through specialty health food distributors.

     Our principal  warehouse  and  distribution  center and  corporate  offices
relocated to our current  facility in October  2000.  We are  continuing to take
steps to reduce our  inventory  levels in an endeavor to lower our warehouse and
distribution costs. See also "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES."

Raw Materials and Suppliers

     The  principal  raw  materials  used by us comprise  aluminum  cans,  glass
bottles and P.E.T.  plastic bottles as well as juices,  high fructose corn syrup
and  sucralose,  the  costs of which are  subject  to  fluctuations.  Due to the
consolidations  that have taken  place in the glass  industry  over the past few
years,  the prices of glass bottles  continue to increase.  The price of plastic
bottles and  aluminum  cans is  expected  to  increase in the future.  This will
continue to exert pressure on our gross margins.

     Generally,  raw  materials  utilized  by us in  our  business  are  readily
available from numerous sources. However, certain raw materials are manufactured
by only one  company.  Sucralose,  which is used  alone or in  combination  with
Acesulfame-K in the Company's low-calorie products, is currently purchased by us
from a single  manufacturer.  Cans for our energy  and  functional  drinks  (8.3
ounces) are only manufactured by one company in the United States.

     With  regard to fruit  juice and  juice-drink  products,  the  industry  is
subject to the  variability  of weather  conditions,  which may result in higher
prices and/or lower consumer demand for juices.

     We  purchase   beverage   flavors,   concentrates,   juices,   supplements,
high-fructose corn syrup, cane sugar,  sucrose,  sucralose and other sweeteners,
from independent  suppliers  located in the United States and abroad,  nutrition
food bars and other ingredients from independent  suppliers in the United States
and abroad, and cereals from an independent supplier located abroad.

     Generally,  flavor suppliers hold the proprietary  rights to their flavors.
Consequently,  we do not currently  have the list of ingredients or formulae for
our flavors and certain of our concentrates  readily  available to us and we may
be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative  suppliers on
short  notice.  We  have  identified   alternative  suppliers  of  many  of  the
supplements contained in many of our beverages and bars. However,  industry-wide
shortages  of certain  fruits  and/or  fruit juices  and/or  supplements  and/or
sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced,
which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products.

     We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of
our  flavors  and  concentrates  from  other  suppliers  as well as to  conclude
arrangements  with  suppliers  which would enable us to obtain access to certain
concentrates  or  product  formulae  in  certain  circumstances.  We  have  been
partially  successful in these endeavors.  Additionally,  in a limited number of
cases,  contractual  restrictions  and/or  the  necessity  to obtain  regulatory
approvals  and  licenses  may limit our  ability to enter into  agreements  with
alternative suppliers and manufacturers and/or distributors.

     In connection with the development of new products and flavors, independent
suppliers  bear a large portion of the expense of product  development,  thereby
enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively  low cost. We have
historically developed and successfully  introduced new products and flavors and
packaging  for our products and intend to continue  developing  and  introducing
additional new beverages and flavors.




Competition

     The  beverage  industry  is  highly  competitive.  The  principal  areas of
competition are pricing, packaging,  development of new products and flavors and
marketing  campaigns.  Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced
by a relatively large number of manufacturers,  most of which have substantially
greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.

     Important  factors  affecting our ability to compete  successfully  include
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective
development  of new,  unique  cutting edge  products,  attractive  and different
packaging,  branded  product  advertising  and  pricing.  We  also  compete  for
distributors  who will  concentrate  on marketing our products over those of our
competitors,  provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf
space in retail outlets.  Competitive  pressures in the alternative,  energy and
functional beverage categories as well as in the cereal,  nutrition food bar and
flavored malt beverage  categories could cause our products to be unable to gain
or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion, which could have a
material adverse affect on our business and results.

     Over the past two years we have  experienced  substantial  competition from
new entrants in the energy drink category.  A number of companies who market and
distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in larger volume packages,  such as 16-
and 20-ounce glass bottles,  including Sobe, Snapple Elements and Arizona,  have
added  supplements to their products with a view to marketing  their products as
"functional" or "energy"  beverages or as having  functional  benefits.  Many of
those  products  are  believed  to  contain  lower  levels  of  supplements  and
principally  deliver  refreshment.  In addition,  many competitive  products are
positioned  differently than our energy or functional  drinks. Our smoothies and
Gold Standard lines are positioned more closely against those products.

     We compete not only for consumer acceptance, but also for maximum marketing
efforts by multi-brand  licensed  bottlers,  brokers and  distributors,  many of
which have a principal  affiliation  with  competing  companies and brands.  Our
products  compete with all liquid  refreshments and with products of much larger
and  substantially  better  financed  competitors,  including  the  products  of
numerous  nationally and  internationally  known producers such as The Coca Cola
Company, PepsiCo, Inc., Cadbury Schwepps, which includes Dr. Pepper/Seven-up, RC
Cola, Snapple,  Mistic and Stewart's brands,  Nestle Beverage Company,  Anheuser
Busch and Ocean  Spray.  More  specifically,  our  products  compete  with other
alternative beverages,  including new age beverages, such as Snapple,  Elements,
Mistic,  Arizona,  Clearly  Canadian,  Sobe,  Stewart's,   Everfresh,  Nantucket
Nectars,  Vitamin Water, Fuse, VeryFine,  V8 Splash,  Calistoga,  Propel Fitness
Water,  AquaFina,  Dasani,  Reebok,  and Crystal Geyser brands. Due to the rapid
growth of the alternative beverage segment of the beverage marketplace,  certain
large companies such as The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo,  Inc. have introduced
products in that market segment which compete directly with our products such as
Nestea, Fruitopia,  Lipton, Propel, AquaFina,  Dasani, Adrenaline Rush, Amp, KMX
and Dole.  Our products  also  compete  with private  label brands such as those
carried by grocery store chains and club stores.

     Our fruit juice smoothies  compete directly with Kern's,  Jumex,  Jugos del
Valle and Libby's  nectars,  V8 Splash  Smoothies,  as well as with single serve
juice  products  produced by many  competitors.  Such  competitive  products are
packaged in glass and P.E.T. bottles ranging from 8- to 48 ounces in size and in
11.5-ounce aluminum cans. The juice content of such competitive  products ranges
from 1% to 100%.

     Our apple and other juice products  compete directly with Tree Top, Mott's,
Martinelli's,  Welch's, Ocean Spray, Tropicana,  Minute Maid, Langers, Apple and
Eve,  Seneca,  Northland  and also with  other  brands of apple  juice and juice
blends, especially store brands.



     Our energy drinks, including Hansen's(R) Diet Red and Monster(TM) energy in
8.3- and 16-ounce cans,  compete  directly with Red Bull,  Adrenaline Rush, Amp,
180, KMX, Venom, Extreme Energy Shot, Rockstar,  Red Devil,  Lipovitan,  MET-Rx,
Hype,  XTC,  and many  other  brands  and our other  functional  drinks  compete
directly with Elix, Lipovitan, MET-Rx, Think, and other brands.

     Our E2O Energy  WaterTM  and still water  products  compete  directly  with
Vitamin Water,  Reebok,  Propel,  Dasani,  Evian,  Crystal Geyser, Naya, Palomar
Mountain, Sahara, Arrowhead,  Dannon, and other brands of still water especially
store brands.

     The nutrition food bar and cereal categories as well as flavored malt-based
drink categories are also highly competitive. Principal areas of competition are
pricing,  packaging,  development  of new  products  and flavors  and  marketing
campaigns.  Our cereals  compete with  traditional  cereals of companies such as
Kellogg's,  General Mills,  Kashi and Nature Valley, and our nutrition food bars
compete with  products of other  independent  bar  companies  such as Power Bar,
Balance Bar, Gatorade, Kashi, Cliff Bar, MET-Rx, and numerous other bars.

     Our Hard e product competes  directly with wine coolers,  such as Seagram's
and Bartles and James and  flavored  low alcohol  beverages  such as Mike's Hard
Lemonade,  Hooper's Hooch, Doc Otis Hard Lemonade,  Smirnoff Ice, Skyy Blue/Blue
Skyy,  Zima and Rick's Spiked Lemonade and other flavored malt and alcohol based
drinks.  Many of these products are produced by large national and international
manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and
distribution  resources than Hansen.  Such  companies  include  Anheuser  Busch,
Miller Brewing Company, Coors, Gallo Winery, and Diageo plc.

Sales and Marketing

     We focus on consumers  who seek  products  that are perceived to be natural
and  healthy  and  emphasize  the  natural   ingredients   and  the  absence  of
preservatives,  sodium, artificial coloring and caffeine in our beverages (other
than our energy drinks) and the addition to most of our products, of one or more
supplements.  We reinforce this message in our product packaging.  Our marketing
strategy  with  respect to our  nutrition  food bars and cereals is similarly to
focus on consumers  who seek bars and cereals  that are  perceived to be natural
and  healthy.   We  emphasize  the  natural   ingredients  and  the  absence  of
preservatives  and,  in the case of the  cereals,  the fact that they are G.M.O.
free.  Our marketing  strategy with respect to our Hard e product is to focus on
adult  consumers  who  seek an  alcohol-based  beverage  that  is good  tasting,
fashionable and meets consumers' needs.

     Our sales and  marketing  strategy  is to focus our  efforts on  developing
brand  awareness  and trial  through  sampling  both in stores  and at events in
respect of all our beverage,  food and alcoholic beverage  products.  We use our
branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events at which we distribute
our  products to  consumers  for  sampling.  We utilize  "push-pull"  tactics to
achieve  maximum shelf and display  space  exposure in sales outlets and maximum
demand  from  consumers  for  our  products  including  advertising,   in  store
promotions and in store  placement of point of sale  materials and racks,  prize
promotions,  price promotions,  competitions,  endorsements from selected public
figures,  coupons,  sampling and  sponsorship of selected  causes such as breast
cancer  research  as well as sports  figures  and  sporting  events  such as the
Hansen's Energy Pro Pipeline Surfing competition,  marathons,  10k runs, bicycle
races,  volleyball  tournaments and other health and sports related  activities,
including  extreme  sports,  particularly  supercross,  freestyle  motor  cross,
surfing,  skateboarding,   wakeboarding,  skiing,  snowboarding,  BMX,  Mountain
Biking,  etc. and also participate in product  demonstrations,  food tasting and
other related events.  Posters, print, radio and television advertising together
with price  promotions  and  coupons  are also used  extensively  to promote the
Hansen's(R) brand.

     Management  continues  to  believe  that one of the keys to  success in the
beverage  industry  is  differentiation;  such as  making  Hansen's(R)  products
clearly distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers.  We review
our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to
make them different,  better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our
products  were  redesigned  in an  endeavor  to develop a new system to maximize
their visibility and  identification,  wherever they may be placed in stores and
we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time.




     Where  appropriate  we  partner  with  retailers  to assist  our  marketing
efforts.  For example,  while we retain  responsibility for the marketing of the
Juice  Slam(TM)  line of  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks,  Costco  has
undertaken sole responsibility for the marketing of the Juice Blast(R) line.

     We  increased   expenditures  for  our  sales  and  marketing  programs  by
approximately 26% in 2002 compared to 2001. As of February 28, 2003, we employed
63 employees in sales and marketing activities.

Customers

     Our customers are typically retail and specialty chains,  club stores, mass
merchandisers,  full service beverage distributors and health food distributors.
In 2002,  sales  to  retailers  represented  56% of our  revenue,  sales to full
service  distributors  represented 26% of our revenue,  and sales to health food
distributors represented 11% of our revenue.

     Our major  customers  include  Costco,  Trader  Joe's,  Sam's  Club,  Vons,
Ralph's,  Wal-Mart,  Safeway  and  Albertson's.   One  customer,  Costco  (which
purchases different products of Hansen's regionally and one product nationally),
accounted  for  approximately  18% of our  sales in  2002.  A  decision  by that
customer or any other major  customer to  decrease  amounts  purchased  from the
Company or to cease carrying our products could have a material  negative effect
on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.

Seasonality

     Sales of ready-to-drink  beverages are somewhat  seasonal,  with the second
and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume
of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather  conditions.  Sales
of  our  beverage   products  may  become   increasingly   subject  to  seasonal
fluctuations  as more sales occur outside of California.  Certain  beverages are
more seasonal than others i.e. E2O Energy Water and natural sodas as compared to
apple juice and children's multi-vitamin juices.

Intellectual Property

     We own  numerous  trademarks  that  are  very  important  to our  business.
Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use
and/or their  registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found
to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as
long as the  trademarks are in use. We also own the copyright in and to numerous
statements made and content appearing on the packaging of our products.

     The  Hansen's(R)  trademark is crucial to our business.  This  trademark is
registered  in the U.S.  Patent and  Trademark  Office and in various  countries
throughout the world. The Hansen's(R)  trademark is owned by us and was acquired
from a trust (the "Trust") which was created by an agreement between HBC and the
predecessor company of Fresh Juice Company of California ("FJC") (the "Agreement
of Trust").  The Trust licensed to HBC in perpetuity on an exclusive  world-wide
royalty-free basis the right to use the Hansen's(R) trademark in connection with
the manufacture,  sale and  distribution of carbonated  beverages and waters and
shelf stable fruit juices and drinks containing fruit juices.  In addition,  the
Trust  licensed to HBC, in perpetuity,  on an exclusive  world-wide  basis,  the
right to use the Hansen's(R) trademark in connection with the manufacture,  sale
and distribution of certain non-carbonated  beverages and water in consideration
of royalty payments. There was a similar license agreement between the Trust and
HBC with regard to  non-beverage  products.  No royalties were payable on sodas,
Energy drinks, juices,  lemonades,  juice cocktails,  fruit juice Smoothies, the
Signature  Soda  line  or on  the  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks.  As
explained below, no royalty expenses were incurred during 2002, 2001 or 2000.




     HBC, FJC's  predecessor  and the Trust also entered into a Royalty  Sharing
Agreement  pursuant to which royalties  payable by third parties procured by FJC
or its  predecessor  or HBC are initially  shared between the Trust and HBC and,
after a specified  amount of royalties  have been  received,  are shared equally
between HBC and FJC.  Under the terms of the  Agreement  of Trust,  FJC receives
royalty  income  paid to the  Trust in excess  of Trust  expenses  and a reserve
therefor.

     Effective  September 22, 1999, we entered into an Assignment  and Agreement
with FJC pursuant to which we acquired  exclusive  ownership of the  Hansen's(R)
trademark  and trade names.  Under the  Assignment  and  Agreement,  among other
matters,  we acquired all FJC's rights as grantor and  beneficiary of the Trust,
all FJC's rights as licensee under certain license  agreement  pursuant to which
FJC has the right to manufacture, sell and distribute fresh juice products under
the  Hansen's(R)  trademark  and all  FJC's  rights  under the  Royalty  Sharing
Agreement  referred to above, as well as certain  additional rights, for a total
consideration  of  $775,010,  payable  over three  years.  FJC is  permitted  to
continue to  manufacture,  sell and  distribute  fresh juice  products under the
Hansen's(R) trademark for a period of five years. Consequently, we now have full
ownership of the  Hansen's(R)  trademark and our obligation to pay royalties to,
and to share royalties with, FJC has been  terminated.  As of December 31, 2002,
the total  consideration had been paid to FJC and no further amounts are payable
to FJC.

     We have  applied to register a number of  trademarks  in the United  States
including,  but not limited to, Hard e(TM), A New Kind a Buzz(TM),  Monster(TM),
Monster  Energy  (TM),  Unleash  the Beast  (TM),  Blue  energy(TM)  and  Energy
hydration system(TM).

     We own in our own right, a number of trademarks including,  but not limited
to, Hansen's(R),  Hansen's energy(R), Energade(R), Hansen's E2O Energy Water(R),
Hansen's  slim-down(R),   THE  REAL  DEAL(R),   LIQUIDFRUIT(R),   Imported  from
Nature(R),  California's  Natural Choice(R),  California's  Choice(R),  Medicine
Man(R), Dyna Juice(R),  Equator(R),  Hansen's power(R),  bewell(R),  anti-ox(R),
d-stress(R),   stamina(R),   Aqua  Blast(R),   Antioxjuice(R)   Intellijuice(R),
Defense(R),  Immunejuice(R),  Hansen's Natural  Multi-Vitamin  Juice Slam(R) and
Juice  Blast(R)  in the United  States  and the  Hansen's(R)  and  "Smoothie(R)"
trademarks in a number of countries around the world.

     In September  2000,  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the Blue Sky
Natural  Beverage  business,  we, through our wholly owned  subsidiary Blue Sky,
acquired the Blue Sky  trademark,  which is  registered in the United States and
Canada.

     In May  2001,  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the  Junior  Juice
Beverage  business,  we,  through  our wholly  owned  subsidiary  Junior  Juice,
acquired  the  Junior  Juice(R)  trademark,  which is  registered  in the United
States.

     On April 4, 2000,  the United States  Patent and Trademark  Office issued a
patent to us for an invention  related to a shelf structure  (rolling rack) and,
more particularly,  a shelf structure for a walk-in cooler. Such shelf structure
is utilized by us to secure  shelf space for and to  merchandise  our energy and
functional  drinks in  8.3-ounce  slim cans in  refrigerated  Visi  coolers  and
walk-in coolers in retail stores.

Government Regulation

     The production,  distribution  and sale in the United States of many of our
products is subject to the Federal  Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act;  the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational  Safety and Health
Act; various environmental  statutes; and various other federal, state and local
statutes and  regulations  applicable to the production,  transportation,  sale,
safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.

     In  connection  with Hard e, the  production  and  marketing  of  alcoholic
beverages  is subject  to the rules and  regulations  of the Bureau of  Alcohol,
Tobacco  and  Firearms  and in each  state,  is also  subject  to the  rules and
regulations of state  regulatory  agencies.  The Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and
Firearms and state regulatory  agencies also regulate the labeling of containers
containing  alcoholic  beverages  including,   without  limitation,   statements
concerning product name and ingredients as well as advertising and marketing, in
connection therewith.




     A California  law requires  that a specific  warning  appear on any product
that  contains  a  component  listed by the State as having  been found to cause
cancer or birth defects.  The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the
possibility  of having to provide  warnings  on their  products  because the law
recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning
is not  required.  Consequently,  even trace  amounts of listed  components  can
expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels.  Products containing
listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to
the product  solely by a municipal  water supply are  generally  exempt from the
warning requirement.  While none of our beverage products are currently required
to display  warnings  under this law,  we cannot  predict  whether an  important
component of any of our products  might be added to the  California  list in the
future.  We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under
this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.

     Bottlers  of  our  beverage   products   presently  offer   non-refillable,
recyclable  containers  in all areas of the United  States and  Canada.  Some of
these  bottlers also offer  refillable  containers,  which are also  recyclable.
Measures have been enacted in various  localities and states that require that a
deposit be charged for certain non-refillable  beverage containers.  The precise
requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product
stewardship  proposals  have been  introduced  in states and  localities  and in
Congress,  and we anticipate  that similar  legislation  or  regulations  may be
proposed  in the  future at the local,  state and  federal  levels,  both in the
United States and elsewhere.

     Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local
environmental  laws and  regulations.  Compliance with these  provisions has not
had, and we do not expect such  compliance to have, any material  adverse effect
upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Employees

     As of February 28, 2003, we employed a total of 111 employees,  109 persons
on a full-time basis. Of our 111 employees,  we employ 48 in administrative  and
quality control capacities and 63 persons in sales and marketing capacities.

Compliance with Environmental Laws

     In California,  we are required to collect  deposits from our customers and
to remit such  deposits to the State of California  Department  of  Conservation
based  upon  the  number  of  cans  and  bottles  of  certain   carbonated   and
non-carbonated   products  sold.  In  certain  other  states  and  Canada  where
Hansen's(R) products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our
customers and to remit such  deposits to the  respective  conservation  agencies
based  upon  the  number  of  cans  and  bottles  of  certain   carbonated   and
non-carbonated products, sold in such states.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     Our  corporate  offices and main  warehouse  are  located at 1010  Railroad
Street,  Corona,  California  92882.  We lease this facility  under a lease that
expires in October  2010.  The area of the  facility  is  approximately  113,600
square  feet.  Additionally,  in  January  2003  we  entered  into a  lease  for
additional warehouse space in Corona,  California.  The area of this facility is
approximately  38,400  square feet.  This lease will expire in March 2005 but is
terminable  with notice prior to the  expiration  date. We also rent  additional
warehouse  space on a  short-term  basis from time to time in public  warehouses
situated throughout the United States and Canada.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In March 2001, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Central  District of  California  against South Beach  Beverage  Company LLC
("Sobe"),  for  patent  infringement,   violation  of  trademark  rights,  false
advertising, unfair competition,  trespass to chattels and tortious interference
with business  relations  arising from Sobe's unlawful  conduct and unauthorized
use of our  property  and our  patent  in  respect  of our  rolling  rack  shelf
structure,  Sobe's improper business  practices,  interference with our right to
conduct business, injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages. On January
3, 2002, we filed a motion to supplement our complaint. In our motion, we sought
to add two of Sobe's  affiliates,  PepsiCo,  Inc. and the Pepsi Bottling Company
Group Inc.  as  co-defendants.  At about the same  time,  Sobe filed a motion to
enforce an alleged  settlement.  In its motion,  Sobe  alleges  that the parties
reached a binding  settlement and that the case should be dismissed.  We contend
that the proposed  agreement was never  finalized or signed and is  consequently
not binding on us. Both motions have been under  submission  since February 2002
and we are currently awaiting the decision of the court.

     In December 2002, a non-profit  organization  describing itself as Citizens
for Responsible  Business Inc., filed a complaint  against us together with more
than  a  hundred  additional  defendants  comprising  retailers,   distributors,
manufacturers  and suppliers,  in the Superior  Court of San Francisco.  In that
complaint,  the plaintiff  seeks  preliminary  and permanent  injunctive  relief
enjoining  the Company  and all other  defendants  from  selling  food  products
advertised  as "ginseng" or "siberian  ginseng" that are not derived from plants
classified within the genus "panax", for restitution and disgourgement of monies
obtained from the sale of products advertised as "ginseng" or "siberian ginseng"
which were not derived from plants  classified  within the genus "panax" or were
derived from eleuthero plants, attorneys fees and other relief. We are defending
such  complaint  and have  been  advised  by our  counsel  that we have good and
meritorious defenses to the complaint.  In any event, as siberian ginseng is not
a  material  ingredient  in any of our  products  and is used in only a  limited
number of our  products,  it is not  expected  that  ceasing  to  advertise  our
products as  containing  this  ingredient,  if  necessary,  will have an adverse
effect on the sales of our products.

     During 2002,  in response to our cease and desist letter to Skyy Spirits in
which we alleged  infringement  by Skyy Spirits  and/or its licensee of our Blue
Sky(R)  trademark,  Skyy Spirits filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the  Northern  District  of  California  for a  declaratory  order and
additional  relief.  We filed a  counterclaim  against  Skyy  Spirits and joined
Miller Brewing  Company in the proceedings in which we have sought an injunction
and claimed  damages,  including an accounting  for profits  earned by both Skyy
Spirits and Miller Brewing  Company,  from the sale of the  infringing  beverage
products and further relief.




     Furthermore,  we are subject to litigation  from time to time in the normal
course of  business.  Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of such
litigation,  based on the facts known to us and after consultation with counsel,
we believe that such litigation  will not have a material  adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

     Except as described above,  there are no material pending legal proceedings
to  which  we or any of our  subsidiaries  is a  party  or to  which  any of our
properties is subject,  other than ordinary and routine litigation incidental to
our business.

abstaining.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

     You  should  read the  following  discussion  together  with the  financial
statements  and the related  notes  included  elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  This
discussion  contains  forward-looking  statements that are based on management's
current   expectations,   estimates  and  projections  about  our  business  and
operations.  Our actual  results  may  differ  materially  from those  currently
anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements.

General

     During 2002, we continued to expand our existing  product lines and further
develop our  markets.  In  particular,  we continue to focus on  developing  and
marketing  beverages  that fall within the category  generally  described as the
"alternative" beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks.

     We achieved  record  sales in 2002.  The increase in gross and net sales in
2002 was primarily attributable to sales of our Monster (TM) energy drink, which
was introduced in April 2002, as well as increased  sales of Natural Sodas,  E2O
Energy  WaterTM,  which was introduced in June 2001,  Energade(R)  energy sports
drinks which were introduced in July 2001, apple juice, and Soy Smoothies, which
were  introduced  in December  2001.  We also  benefited to a lesser extent from
increased  sales  of  the  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks  and  Junior
Juice(R),  which  trademark was acquired in May 2001.  The increase in gross and
net sales was partially offset by decreased sales of Signature Soda,  Smoothies,
Hard e, functional drinks and teas, lemonades and cocktails.

     During 2002,  sales outside of California  represented 42% of our aggregate
sales, as compared to approximately 39% of our aggregate sales in 2001. Sales to
distributors  outside  the United  States  during 2002  amounted  to  $1,242,000
compared to $1,233,000 in 2001.




     In 2002,  we  introduced  a diet ginger ale,  natural  mixers,  Monster(TM)
energy,  E2O Energy  Water in 24-ounce  clear  P.E.T.  plastic  bottles,  a 100%
sparkling  Apple Cider,  a Diet Red energy drink, a Blue Sky(R) energy drink and
diet  sparkling  Lemonades  and  Orangeades.  We also  introduced a line of diet
Natural  Sodas  in  12-ounce  cans at the end of  2000/beginning  of 2001 and an
additional  flavor,  Ginger Ale, to our regular  natural  soda line in 2001.  In
addition,  in 2001, we also  introduced  our original  energy drink in 8.3-ounce
glass bottles,  two additional energy drinks in 8.3-ounce  slim-cans,  sparkling
lemonades  and  orangeades in 1-liter glass  bottles,  Medicine  Man(R) in glass
bottles,  Energade(R)  in  23.5-ounce  cans,  E2O Energy Water in 24-ounce  blue
P.E.T. plastic bottles, Soy Smoothies in 1-liter and 11-ounce aseptic packaging,
additional  juice blends in 64-ounce  P.E.T.  bottles,  fruit juice Smoothies in
16-ounce P.E.T. bottles, functional nutrition bars and active nutrition bars. In
2002, we discontinued our smoothie line in 64-ounce P.E.T. bottles and converted
our  smoothie  products in 12-ounce  glass  bottles to 16-ounce  P.E.T.  plastic
bottles.  We also discontinued our entire Healthy  Start/Silver Foxes 100% juice
line in glass and P.E.T.  plastic  bottles and the Medicine  Man(R) line. At the
beginning of 2003,  we repackaged  our  Signature  Soda line into new lower cost
glass packaging.

     Sales of our dual-branded 100% juice line named "Juice Blast(R)", which was
launched  in  conjunction  with  Costco and is sold  nationally  through  Costco
stores,  were slightly higher in 2002 than in 2001. We have, in conjunction with
Costco,  introduced new flavors in place of certain of the existing  flavors and
will  continue to introduce  new flavors in an effort to ensure that the variety
pack remains fresh and different for consumers.

     In  September  2000,  HBC,  through its wholly owned  subsidiary  Blue Sky,
acquired the Blue Sky(R)  Natural Soda  business.  The Blue Sky(R)  Natural Soda
brand is the leading  natural  soda in the health  food  trade.  Blue Sky offers
natural sodas,  premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and
anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans.

     In May 2001,  HBC,  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Junior  Juice,
acquired the Junior Juice(R) beverage business. The Junior Juice(R) product line
is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce  aseptic packages and
is targeted at toddlers.

     During 2002, we entered into several new  distribution  agreements  for the
sale of our products,  both within and outside the United  States.  As discussed
under "ITEM 1 BUSINESS - MANUFACTURE  and  DISTRIBUTION",  we anticipate that we
will continue  building our national sales force in 2003 to support and grow the
sales of our products.

     Further,  during  2002,  we,  through  our wholly  owned  subsidiary,  HEB,
continued to market a malt-based beverage called Hard e, which contains up to 5%
alcohol. The Hard e product is not marketed under the Hansen's(R) name.

     We continue to incur  expenditures  in connection  with the development and
introduction of new products and flavors.

Results of Operations  for the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year
Ended December 31, 2001

     Gross Sales.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, gross sales were $115.5
million,  an increase of $15.8 million or 15.8% higher than gross sales of $80.7
million for the year ended  December  31,  2001.  The increase in gross sales is
primarily  attributable to the  introduction of new products and increased sales
of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales".

     Net  Sales.  For the year ended  December  31,  2002,  net sales were $92.0
million,  an increase of $11.3  million or 14.1%  higher than net sales of $80.7
million for the year ended  December  31,  2001.  The  increase in net sales was
primarily  attributable  to sales of our Monster  (TM) energy  drink,  which was
introduced  in April 2002,  as well as  increased  sales of Natural  Sodas,  E2O
Energy  Water,  which was  introduced  in June 2001,  Energade(R)  energy sports




drinks,  which were  introduced in July 2001,  apple juice,  and Soy  Smoothies,
which were  introduced in December  2001.  We also  benefited to a lesser extent
from  increased  sales of the  children's  multi-vitamin  juice  drinks,  Junior
Juice(R),  which was  acquired  in May 2001,  and  smoothies  in P.E.T.  plastic
bottles.  The increase in net sales was partially  offset by decreased  sales of
Signature  Soda, Hard e, functional  drinks,  teas,  lemonades and cocktails and
smoothies  in  cans  as  well  as  an  increase  in  discounts,  allowances  and
promotional payments, notably higher coupon costs.

     Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $33.2  million for the year ended  December
31,  2002,  an increase of $4.3  million or 15.2% over the $28.9  million  gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2001. Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales was 36.1% for the year ended  December 31, 2002 which was slightly  higher
than  gross  profit as a  percentage  of net  sales of 35.8% for the year  ended
December 31, 2001.  The increase in gross profit was primarily  attributable  to
increased  net  sales.  Although  a greater  percentage  of our sales  comprised
products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit
margins was reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our
products notably higher coupon costs.

     Total Operating  Expenses.  Total operating expenses were $28.0 million for
the year ended  December  31,  2002,  an increase of $4.7  million or 19.9% over
total operating  expenses of $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Total  operating  expenses as a percentage of net sales  increased to 30.4 % for
the year ended  December  31, 2002,  from 28.9% for the year ended  December 31,
2001. The increase in total  operating  expenses was primarily  attributable  to
increased selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  The increase in total
operating  expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily  attributable  to
the  comparatively  larger  increase  in  selling,  general  and  administrative
expenses than the increase in net sales.

     Selling,  General and Administrative.  Selling,  general and administrative
expenses were $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of
$5.1 million or 22.3% over selling, general and administrative expenses of $22.8
million  for  the  year  ended   December   31,  2001.   Selling,   general  and
administrative  expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.3% for the
year ended  December  31, 2002 from 28.3% for the year ended  December 31, 2001.
Selling  expenses  were $16.1  million for the year ended  December 31, 2002, an
increase of $3.7 million or 29.9% over selling expenses of $12.4 million for the
year ended  December 31,  2001.  Selling  expenses as a percentage  of net sales
increased to 17.4% for the year ended  December 31, 2002 from 15.3% for the year
ended  December  31,  2001.  The  increase  in selling  expenses  was  primarily
attributable  to  increased   distribution   (freight)  and  storage   expenses,
advertising,   point-of-sale   materials  and  merchandise  displays,   in-store
demonstrations  and  graphic  design.  The  increase  in  selling  expenses  was
partially  offset by a  decrease  in  expenditures  for  premiums.  General  and
administrative expenses were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
an increase of $1.4 million or 13.3% over general and administrative expenses of
$10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  General and  administrative
expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the year ended December 31,
2002 which was  comparable to the year ended  December 31, 2001. The increase in
general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in
payroll  costs,  charitable  contributions,  fees paid for legal and  accounting
services  and   increased   travel   expenses  as  well  as  other  general  and
administrative  expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as
a  percentage  of net sales was  primarily  attributable  to the increase in net
sales and the comparatively lower increase in payroll costs.

     Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark
license and  trademarks  was $55,000 for the year ended  December  31,  2002,  a
decrease of $452,000 from  amortization  of trademark  license and trademarks of
$507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in  amortization  of
trademark  license  and  trademarks  was due to the  adoption  of  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 142 in the first  quarter of 2002
(Note  2  of  the  financial   statements)  which  eliminated   amortization  on
indefinite-lived intangible assets.




     Operating  Income.  Operating  income was $5.3  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2002,  compared to $5.6  million for the year ended  December 31,
2001. The $258,000  decrease in operating  income was primarily  attributable to
increased  operating  expenses,  which was partially  offset by increased  gross
profit.

     Net Non-operating  Expense. Net non-operating  expense was $228,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2002,  which was $291,000  lower than net  non-operating
expense of $519,000  for the year ended  December 31,  2001.  Net  non-operating
expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest
and  financing  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2002 was  $231,000,  as
compared to $528,000  for the year ended  December  31,  2001.  The  decrease in
interest and financing expense was primarily  attributable to decreased interest
expense  incurred on our  borrowings  which was  primarily  attributable  to the
decrease in outstanding loan balances and lower interest rates.  Interest income
for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $3,000,  as compared to interest income
of $9,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest  income
was primarily  attributable  to a reduction in the cash available for investment
during the year ended December 31, 2002.

     Provision for Income  Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was $2.0 million  which was  comparable  to the  provision for
income taxes of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective
combined federal and state tax rate for 2002 was 40.2%,  which was comparable to
the effective tax rate of 40.0% for 2001.

     Net Income.  Net income was $3.0  million for the year ended  December  31,
2002,  which was  comparable to net income for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The $4.3 million  increase in gross profit and decrease in nonoperating  expense
of  $291,000  for the year  ended  December  31,  2002 was  offset by  increased
operating expenses of $4.7 million.

Results of Operations  for the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to the Year
Ended December 31, 2000

     Gross Sales.  For the year ended December 31, 2001,  gross sales were $99.7
million,  an increase of $13.6 million or 15.8% higher than gross sales of $86.1
million for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The increase in gross sales is
primarily  attributable to the  introduction of new products and increased sales
of certain of our existing products as discussed below in "Net Sales".

     Net  Sales.  For the year ended  December  31,  2001,  net sales were $80.7
million,  an increase of $9.0  million or 12.5% higher than gross sales of $71.7
million for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The  increase in net sales was
primarily  attributable to increased  sales of natural sodas,  Blue Sky(R) soda,
which was acquired in  September  2000,  apple juice and sales of Junior  Juice,
which was  acquired in May 2001.  The  increase in sales was  attributable  to a
lesser extent to sales of Energade(R), which was introduced in July 2001 and E2O
Energy Water,  which was  introduced in June 2001. The increase in net sales was
partially  offset by decreased  sales of smoothies in glass and P.E.T.  bottles,
Signature Sodas,  children's  multi-vitamin juice drinks, and teas, lemonade and
juice  cocktails  as well as increased  discounts,  allowances  and  promotional
payments.

     Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $28.9  million for the year ended  December
31, 2001, a decrease of $64,000 or 0.2% from the $29.0  million gross profit for
the year ended  December  31, 2000.  Gross  profit as a percentage  of net sales
decreased to 35.8% for the year ended  December 31, 2001 from 40.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable
to  increases  in  discounts,  allowances  and  promotional  payments as well as
increased  cost of goods sold which was almost  wholly  offset by increased  net
sales.  The decrease in gross  profit as a percentage  of net sales is primarily
attributable  to slightly lower margins  achieved as a result of a change in our
product and customer mix.

     Total Operating  Expenses.  Total operating expenses were $23.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.3 million or 5.8% over total
operating  expenses of $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Total




operating  expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.9% for the year
ended  December 31, 2001,  from 30.7% for the year ended  December 31, 2000. The
increase in total  operating  expenses was primarily  attributable  to increased
selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  The decrease in total operating
expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the increase
in net sales and the  comparatively  lower  increase  in  selling,  general  and
administrative expenses.

     Selling,  General  and  Administrative   expenses.   Selling,  general  and
administrative expenses were $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001,
an increase of $1.1  million or 5.3% over  selling,  general and  administrative
expenses of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Selling, general
and administrative  expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.3% for
the year ended  December  31,  2001 from 30.2% for the year ended  December  31,
2000.  Selling expenses were $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001,
a decrease of $244,000 or 1.9% over  selling  expenses of $12.6  million for the
year ended  December 31,  2000.  Selling  expenses as a percentage  of net sales
decreased to 15.3% for the year ended  December 31, 2001 from 17.6% for the year
ended  December  31,  2000.  The  decrease  in selling  expenses  was  primarily
attributable  to  a  decrease  in  expenditures  for  advertising,   merchandise
displays,  point of sale and in-store demonstrations which was largely offset by
an increase in distribution  (freight) expenses,  commissions,  expenditures for
graphic  design and  premiums  as well as fees paid for  slotting.  General  and
administrative expenses were $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001,
an increase of $1.4 million or 15.4% over general and administrative expenses of
$9.1 million for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  General and  administrative
expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% for the year ended December 31,
2001 as compared to 12.6% for the year ended  December 31, 2000. The increase in
general and administrative expenses was partially attributable to an increase in
payroll  costs,  which was  partially  offset by a decrease in other general and
administrative  costs. The increase in payroll costs was partially  attributable
to noncash  compensation  expense  related to the  exercise of stock  options of
$231,000.

     Amortization of Trademark License and Trademarks. Amortization of trademark
license and  trademarks  was $507,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2001,  an
increase of $136,000 over  amortization  of trademark  license and trademarks of
$371,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in  amortization  of
trademark license and trademarks was primarily  attributable to the amortization
of the Blue Sky  trademark  for a full year since the  trademark was acquired in
September  2000. To a lesser extent,  the increase in  amortization of trademark
license and trademarks was due to the  acquisition of the Junior Juice trademark
in May 2001.

     Operating  Income.  Operating  income was $5.6  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2001,  compared to $6.9  million for the year ended  December 31,
2000. The $1.3 million decrease in operating  income was primarily  attributable
to increased operating  expenses,  which was partially offset by increased gross
profit.

     Net Non-operating  Expense. Net non-operating  expense was $519,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2001,  which was $150,000 higher than net  non-operating
expense of $369,000  for the year ended  December 31,  2000.  Net  non-operating
expense consists of interest and financing expense and interest income. Interest
and  financing  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2001 was  $528,000,  as
compared to $382,000  for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The  increase in
interest and  financing  expense was primarily  attributable  to the increase in
long-term debt, primarily related to the acquisition of the Blue Sky business in
2000. See also "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.  Interest income for the
year ended  December  31,  2001 was $9,000,  as  compared to interest  income of
$13,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  The decrease in interest  income
was primarily  attributable  to a reduction in the cash available for investment
during the year ended December 31, 2001.

     Provision for Income  Taxes.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2001 was $2.0 million as compared to provision  for income taxes of
$2.6  million for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The  effective  combined
federal and state tax rate for 2001 was 40.0% as compared to 40.1% for 2000. The
decrease  in the  provision  for  income  taxes was  primarily  attributable  to
decreased operating income.




     Net Income.  Net income was $3.0  million for the year ended  December  31,
2001,  compared  to $3.9  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  The
$896,000  decrease in net income was attributable to decreased  operating income
of $1.3  million and  increased  non-operating  expense of  $150,000,  which was
partially offset by decreased provision for income taxes of $603,000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     As of December 31,  2002,  the Company had working  capital of  $14,950,000
compared to working capital of $12,978,000 as of December 31, 2001. The increase
in  working  capital  was  primarily  attributable  to net income  earned  after
adjustments for certain non-cash expenses,  primarily  amortization of trademark
license  and  trademarks,  depreciation  and other  amortization,  a decrease in
deposits  and other  assets and an increase in deferred  income  taxes which was
partially  offset by payments made in reduction of long-term  debt and increased
expenditures for the acquisition of property, trademark license and trademarks.

     Net cash provided by operating  activities  for the year ended December 31,
2002 was  $2,727,000,  compared to cash  provided  by  operating  activities  of
$5,203,000  during 2001.  The decrease in cash provided by operating  activities
was  primarily  attributable  to  increases  in accounts  receivable,  which was
partially  offset  by  decreases  in  amortization  of  trademark   license  and
trademarks,  decreases  in  inventory,  and an  increase  in  accounts  payable.
Purchases of inventories,  increases in accounts  receivable,  and other assets,
acquisition  of property and equipment,  acquisition  of trademark  licenses and
trademarks,  and  repayment  of our line of  credit  and  accounts  payable  are
expected  to remain our  principal  recurring  use of cash and  working  capital
funds.

     Net cash used in investing  activities for the year ended December 31, 2002
was $92,000 as compared to net cash used in investment activities of $682,000 in
2001.  The  decrease  in net cash used in  investing  activities  was  primarily
attributable  to lower  levels  of  purchases  of  property  and  equipment  and
trademark acquisitions, which was partially offset by increased expenditures for
deposits and other assets in 2002. Management,  from time to time, considers the
acquisition  of capital  equipment,  particularly,  specific items of production
equipment  required  to produce  certain of our  products,  merchandise  display
racks, vans and promotional  vehicles,  coolers and other promotional  equipment
and businesses  compatible with the image of the  Hansen's(R)  brand, as well as
the introduction of new product lines.

     Net cash used in financing  activities was $2.3 million for the year ending
December 31, 2002, as compared to net cash used in financing  activities of $4.4
million  in 2001.  The  decrease  in net cash used in  financing  activities  as
compared to the prior year was  primarily  attributable  to decreased  principal
payments of long-term debt,  which was marginally  offset by decreased  proceeds
from the issuance of common stock during 2002.

     In 1997,  HBC  obtained a credit  facility  from  Comerica  Bank-California
("Comerica"),  consisting of a revolving line of credit of up to $3.0 million in
aggregate  at any  time  outstanding  and a  term  loan  of  $4.0  million.  The
utilization  of the revolving  line of credit by HBC was dependent  upon certain
levels of eligible  accounts  receivable and inventory  from time to time.  Such
revolving line of credit and term loan was secured by substantially all of HBC's
assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, trademark licenses
and certain  equipment.  That  facility was  subsequently  modified from time to
time,  and on September 19, 2000, HBC entered into  modification  agreement with
Comerica which amended certain  provisions  under the above facility in order to
finance  the  acquisition  of the Blue Sky  business,  repay the term loan,  and
provide additional working capital ("Modification  Agreement").  Pursuant to the
Modification  Agreement,  the  revolving  line of credit was  increased to $12.0
million,  reducing to $6.0  million by September  2004.  The  revolving  line of
credit  remains in full force and effect  through  September  2005.  Interest on
borrowings  under the line of credit is based on bank's base (prime) rate,  plus
an  additional  percentage  of up to 0.5% or the LIBOR rate,  plus an additional
percentage of up to 2.5%,  depending upon certain  financial  ratios of HBC from
time to time. At December 31, 2002,  $2,969,000 was outstanding under the credit
facility and borrowing capacity available to the Company from Comerica under the
credit facility was $6,331,000.




     The following represents a summary of the Company's contractual obligations

     The  terms  of the  Company's  line of  credit  contain  certain  financial
covenants including certain financial ratios and annual net income requirements.
The line of credit contains  provisions  under which  applicable  interest rates
will be adjusted in increments  based on the  achievement  of certain  financial
ratios.  The Company was in compliance with the financial  covenants at December
31, 2002.

     If any event of default  shall occur for any reason,  whether  voluntary or
involuntary, Comerica may declare any or all of portions outstanding on the line
of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to
secured parties under the Uniform  Commercial Code,  institute legal proceedings
to foreclose upon the lien and security  interest granted or for the sale of any
or all collateral.

     Management  believes that cash  available from  operations,  including cash
resources and the revolving  line of credit,  will be sufficient for our working
capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials, payments of tax
liabilities,  debt  servicing,  expansion and  development  needs,  purchases of
shares of our  common  stock,  as well as any  purchases  of  capital  assets or
equipment through December 31, 2003.

Critical Accounting Policies

     The  following  summarize  the most  significant  accounting  and reporting
policies and practices of the Company.

     Trademark  License  and  Trademarks  -  Trademark  license  and  trademarks
represent  primarily the  Company's  ownership of the  Hansen's(R)  trademark in
connection with the manufacture,  sale and distribution of beverages,  water and
non-beverage products. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other
trademarks in the United  States as well as in a number of countries  around the
world.  The Company also owns the Blue Sky(R)  trademark,  which was acquired in
September  2000, and the Junior  Juice(R)  trademark,  which was acquired in May
2001.  During  2002,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS No.  142,  Goodwill  and Other
Intangible   Assets.   Under  the  provisions  on  SFAS  No.  142,  the  Company
discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived  trademark licenses and trademarks
while continuing to amortize  remaining  trademark  licenses and trademarks over
one to 25 years.

     Long-Lived Assets - Management regularly reviews property and equipment and
other  long-lived  assets,  including  certain  identifiable  intangibles,   for
possible impairment.  This review occurs annually,  or more frequently if events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable.  If there is  indication of impairment of property and equipment or
amortizable  intangible assets,  then management  prepares an estimate of future
cash flows  (undiscounted  and without interest charges) expected to result from




the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If these cash flows are less
than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write
down the asset to its estimated  fair value.  The fair value is estimated at the
present value of the future cash flows  discounted at a rate  commensurate  with
management's  estimates of the business risks. Annually, or earlier, if there is
indication  of  impairment  of  identified  intangible  assets  not  subject  to
amortization,  management  compares the  estimated  fair value with the carrying
amount  of the  asset.  An  impairment  loss is  recognized  to  write  down the
intangible  asset to its  fair  value if it is less  than the  carrying  amount.
Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and
is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future
conditions. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2002.

     Management  believes that the accounting  estimate related to impairment of
its long lived  assets,  including its trademark  license and  trademarks,  is a
"critical  accounting  estimate" because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change
from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions
about cash flows and  discount  rates;  and (2) the impact that  recognizing  an
impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated  balance sheet,
as well as net income,  could be material.  Management's  assumptions about cash
flows and discount rates require  significant  judgement because actual revenues
and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so.

     In estimating future revenues,  we use internal  budgets.  Internal budgets
are  developed  based on recent  revenues  data for existing  product  lines and
planned timing of future  introductions  of new products and their impact on our
future cash flows.

     Advertising  and  Promotional   Allowances  -  The  Company   accounts  for
advertising  production  costs by expensing such production costs the first time
the related  advertising  takes  place.  In addition,  the Company  supports its
customers  with  promotional  allowances,  a portion  of which is  utilized  for
marketing and indirect advertising by them. In certain instances, portion of the
promotional allowances payable to customers based on the levels of sales to such
customers,  promotion  requirements  or  expected  use  of the  allowances,  are
estimated by the Company. If the level of sales,  promotion  requirements or use
of the allowances are different from such estimates,  the promotional allowances
could, to the extent based on estimates,  be affected.  During 2002, the Company
adopted  Emerging  Issues Task Force  ("EITF") No. 01-9 which  requires  certain
sales  promotions  and customer  allowances  previously  classified  as selling,
general and administrative  expenses to be classified as a reduction of sales or
as cost of goods sold. The Company has conformed its presentation of advertising
and promotional allowances to comply with the provisions of EITF No. 01-9.

Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

     During 2000 and 2001,  the EITF  addressed  various  issues  related to the
income  statement  classification  of certain  promotional  payments,  including
consideration  from a vendor to a reseller or another  party that  purchases the
vendor's products. EITF No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor
to a Customer or Reseller of the Vendor's Products,  was issued in November 2001
and codified  earlier  pronouncements.  The  consensus  requires  certain  sales
promotions and customer allowances previously classified as selling, general and
administrative  expenses to be classified as a reduction of net sales or as cost
of goods sold. The Company  adopted EITF No. 01-9 on January 1, 2002. The effect
of the change in  accounting  related to the  adoption  of EITF No. 01-9 for the
year ended December 31, 2002 was to decrease net sales by $14,846,875,  increase
cost of goods sold by $220,394 and decrease selling,  general and administrative
expenses  by  $15,067,269.  For the year  ended  December  31,  2001  net  sales
decreased by $11,621,396,  cost of goods sold increased by $341,332 and selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased by $11,962,728. For the year ended
December 31, 2000,  $8,026,724  has been  classified as a reduction of net sales
and $133,390 as an increase in cost of goods sold, both of which were previously
reported as selling, general and administrative expense respectively.

     Effective  January 1, 2002, the Company  adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
142,  Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets.  This statement  discontinued  the
amortization  of goodwill and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject to
periodic  impairment  testing.  Upon  adoption  of SFAS  No.  142,  the  Company




evaluated the useful lives of its various trademark  licenses and trademarks and
concluded that certain of the trademark  licenses and trademarks have indefinite
lives.  Unamortized  trademark  licenses and  trademarks  ceased to be amortized
effective January 1, 2002 and will be subject to periodic  impairment  analysis.
Had the non-amortization provision of SFAS No. 142 been adopted as of January 1,
2000, net income and net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000 would have been adjusted as follows:


     On January 1 and December 31, 2002, the  nonamortizing  trademark  licenses
and trademarks  were tested for impairment in accordance  with the provisions of
SFAS No. 142. Fair values were estimated based on the Company's best estimate of
the expected  present  value of future cash flows.  No amounts were  impaired at
that time.  In addition,  the remaining  useful lives of trademark  licenses and
trademarks being amortized were reviewed and deemed to be appropriate.

     The FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations,
which addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for obligations  associated
with the  retirement  of tangible  long-lived  assets and the  associated  asset
retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial  statements issued for
fiscal years  beginning  after  September 15, 2002.  The Company does not expect
that the adoption of this standard will have a material  impact on its financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for
the  Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets,  effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. The new rules on asset  impairment  supersede
FASB Statement No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and
for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of, and provide a single  accounting model
for  long-lived  assets to be disposed of. The Company has performed an analysis
and determined that the adoption of this Statement had no effect on the earnings
or financial position of the Company.

     In April  2002,  the FASB issued  Statement  No.  145,  Rescission  of FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44 and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections,  effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. For most
companies, Statement No. 145 will require gains and losses on extinguishments of
debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing  operations  rather than
as   extraordinary   items  as  previously   required  under  Statement  No.  4.
Extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided
in APB Opinion No. 30. Statement No. 145 also amends Statement No. 13 to require
certain  modifications  to capital  leases be treated  as a  sale-leaseback  and
modifies  the  accounting  for  sub-leases  when the original  lessee  remains a
secondary obligor (or guarantor).  In addition, the FASB rescinded Statement No.
44, which  addressed the accounting for intangible  assets of motor carriers and
made numerous  technical  corrections.  The Company has not yet  determined  the
effect, if any, of the adoption of this Statement.




     In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal  Activities,  which  addresses  financial  accounting  and
reporting for costs  associated with exit or disposal  activities and supersedes
EITF No. 94-3,  Liability  Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits
and Other  Costs to Exit an  Activity  (including  Certain  Costs  Incurred in a
Restructuring.)  SFAS No. 146 requires  that a liability  for a cost  associated
with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF No.  94-3,  a liability  for an exit cost as defined in EITF No. 94-3
was recognized at the date of an entity's  commitment to an exit plan.  SFAS No.
146 also  establishes  that the  liability  should  initially  be  measured  and
recorded at fair value.  The Company will adopt the  provisions  of SFAS No. 146
for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure,  effective for fiscal years ending after
December  15,  2002.  Statement  No. 148 amends  SFAS No.  123,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation,  to provide alternative methods of transition to SFAS
No. 123's fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
SFAS No.  148 also  amends  the  disclosure  provisions  of SFAS No. 123 and APB
Opinion  No. 28,  Interim  Financial  Reporting,  to require  disclosure  in the
summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  of the  effects  of an  entity's
accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee  compensation on reported
net income and  earnings per share in annual and interim  financial  statements.
The Company has adopted the new  disclosure  requirements  of SFAS No. 148 as of
December 31, 2002.

     In  November  2002,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 45,  Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others ("FIN No. 45").  FIN No. 45 clarifies and
expands on existing  disclosure  requirements  for  guarantees,  including  loan
guarantees.  It also would require  that,  at the inception of a guarantee,  the
Company must  recognize a liability for the fair value of its  obligation  under
that guarantee.  The initial fair value  recognition and measurement  provisions
will be applied on a prospective basis to certain  guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002.  The disclosure  provisions are effective for financial
statements  of periods  ending after  December  15,  2002.  The Company does not
expect  that the  adoption  of FIN No.  45 will  have a  material  impact on its
financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 46,  Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,  an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN No. 46"). FIN
No. 46 requires  certain  variable  interest  entities to be consolidated by the
primary  beneficiary of the entity if the equity  investors in the entity do not
have the  characteristics  of a  controlling  financial  interest or do not have
sufficient  equity at risk for the  entity to  finance  its  activities  without
additional  subordinated  financial  support from other  parties.  FIN No. 46 is
effective  for all new  variable  interest  entities  created or acquired  after
January 31, 2003. For variable  interest  entities  created or acquired prior to
February  1, 2003,  the  provisions  of FIN No. 46 must be applied for the first
interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. Since the Company has no
interests in variable  interest  entities,  the Company does not expect that the
adoption of FIN No. 46 will have a material  impact on its  financial  position,
cash flows or results of operations.

Forward Looking Statements

     The Private Security  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act") provides a
safe harbor for forward looking  statements made by or on behalf of the Company.
The Company and its  representatives  may from time to time make written or oral
forward looking statements,  including  statements  contained in this report and
other  filings with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  and in reports to
shareholders  and  announcements.  Certain  statements  made in this  report may
constitute forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the
Securities Act 1933 as amended and Section 21.E of the  Securities  Exchange Act




of 1934, as amended)  regarding the  expectations  of management with respect to
revenues,  profitability,  adequacy of funds from  operations  and our  existing
credit  facility,  among other things.  All statements  which address  operating
performance,  events or developments that management expects or anticipates will
or may occur in the future including statements related to new products,  volume
growth, revenues,  profitability,  adequacy of funds from operations, and/or the
Company's  existing  credit  facility,  earnings  per share  growth,  statements
expressing  general optimism about future operating  results and  non-historical
information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Act.

     These  statements  are qualified by their terms and/or  important  factors,
many of which are outside our control that could cause actual results and events
to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the
following:

o    The  Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital
     expansion plans and general operating activities;
o    Changes in consumer preferences;
o    Changes  in demand that are weather related, particular in areas outside of
     California;
o    Competitive  products  and  pricing  pressures and the Company's ability to
     gain  or  maintain share of sales in the marketplace as a result of actions
     by competitors;
o    The introduction of new products;
o    Laws  and  regulations,  and/or  any changes therein,  including changes in
     accounting standards,  taxation  requirements  (including tax rate changes,
     new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws as
     well as the  Federal Food Drug  and Cosmetic Act,   the  Dietary Supplement
     Health and Education Act,  and regulations made thereunder or in connection
     therewith,  especially those that may affect the way in which the Company's
     products  are  marketed  as  well  as laws and regulations or rules made or
     enforced by the Food and Drug Administration  and/or the Bureau of Alcohol,
     Tobacco and Firearms and/or certain state regulatory agencies;
o    Changes  in  the  cost and availability of raw materials and the ability to
     maintain favorable supply arrangements and relationships and procure timely
     and/or adequate production of all or any of the Company's products;
o    The Company's ability to achieve earnings forecasts,  which may be based on
     projected  volumes  and  sales  of  many product types and/or new products,
     certain  of  which  are  more profitable than others and in respect of many
     which the Company's experience is limited.   There can be no assurance that
     the Company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales;
o    The Company's ability to penetrate new markets;
o    The  marketing  efforts  of distributors of the Company's products, most of
     which  distribute  products  that  are competitive with the products of the
     Company;
o    Unilateral decisions by distributors, grocery store chains, specialty chain
     stores, club stores,  mass merchandisers and other customers to discontinue
     carrying all or any of the Company's products that they are carrying at any
     time;
o    The  terms  and/or  availability  of  the Company's credit facility and the
     actions of its creditors;
o    The effectiveness of the Company's  advertising,  marketing and promotional
     programs;
o    The Company's  ability  to make suitable arrangements for the co-packing of
     its  various  products  including,  but  not  limited  to,  its  energy and
     functional  drinks  in  8.3-ounce slim cans,  smoothies in 11.5-ounce cans,
     E2O Energy Water, Energade, Monster energy drinks, soy smoothies, sparkling
     orangeades and lemonades in glass bottles and other products.

     The foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive.

     Our actual results could be materially different from the results described
or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty
of  estimates,  forecasts  and  projections  and may be  better  or  worse  than
anticipated.  Given these uncertainties,  you should not rely on forward-looking
statements.  Forward-looking  statements represent our estimates and assumptions
only as of the date that they  were  made.  We  expressly  disclaim  any duty to
provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions
associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes
in  circumstances  or  expectations  or the occurrence of  unanticipated  events
except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.




Sales

     The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales
for the past five years.  Data from any one or more quarters is not  necessarily
indicative of annual results or continuing trends.

     Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A "unit case" means a
unit of  measurement  equal to 192 U.S.  fluid  ounces of finished  beverage (24
eight-ounce  servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces
of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases
(or unit case  equivalents)  of  beverages  directly or  indirectly  sold by the
Company. Sales of food bars and cereals are expressed in actual cases. A case of
food bars and cereals is defined as follows:

o    A  fruit  and  grain  bar  and  functional nutrition bar case equals ninety
     1.76-ounce bars.
o    A natural cereal case equals ten 13-ounce boxes measured by volume.
o    An active nutrition bar case equals thirty-two 1.4-ounce bars.

     The Company's  quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that
are primarily  the result of increased  demand in the warmer months of the year.
It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first
and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.  Because the primary  historical market
for Hansen's products is California,  which has a year-long  temperate  climate,
the  effect  of  seasonal  fluctuations  on  quarterly  results  may  have  been
mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution
of Hansen's  products  expands  outside of  California.  The Company has not had
sufficient  experience with its food bars, cereal products and Hard e malt-based
products  and  consequently  has no knowledge of the trends which may occur with
such  products.  Quarterly  fluctuations  may also be affected by other  factors
including the  introduction  of new  products,  the opening of new markets where
temperature  fluctuations are more pronounced,  the addition of new bottlers and
distributors,  changes in the mix of the sales of its  finished  products,  soda
concentrates  and  food  products  and  increased  advertising  and  promotional
expenses. See also "ITEM 1. BUSINESS - SEASONALITY."

Inflation

     The Company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations for the periods presented.




ITEM 7a. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

     The  principal  market risks  (i.e.,  the risk of loss arising from adverse
changes  in market  rates and  prices)  to which the  Company  is exposed to are
fluctuations in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and changes
in interest  rates on the  Company's  long term debt.  The Company is subject to
market  risk with  respect to the cost of  commodities  because  its  ability to
recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive
environment in which it operates.

     At December  31,  2002,  the majority of the  Company's  debt  consisted of
variable rate debt. The amount of variable rate debt fluctuates  during the year
based on the Company's  cash  requirements.  If average  interest  rates were to
increase one percent for the year ended December 31, 2002, the net impact on the
Company's pre-tax earnings would have been approximately $40,000.

Additionally,  the Company will pay outside  directors  $500 for each  committee
meeting attended in person and $250 for each meeting attended by telephone.

Employee Stock Option Plan

     The Company has a stock  option plan (the  "Plan")  that  provided  for the
grant of options to purchase up to  3,000,000  shares of the common stock of the
Company to certain key  employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries.  Options
granted  under the Plan may either be incentive  stock options  qualified  under
Section 422 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  or non-qualified
options.  Such options are exercisable at fair market value on the date of grant
for a period of up to ten years.  Under the Plan,  shares subject to options may
be purchased for cash, or for shares of common stock valued at fair market value
on the date of purchase.  Under the Plan, no  additional  options may be granted
after July 1, 2001.

     During 2001, the Company adopted the Hansen Natural  Corporation 2001 Stock
Option Plan ("2001 Option Plan"). The 2001 Option Plan provides for the grant of
options to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company to
certain key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options granted under
the 2001 Stock Option Plan may be incentive  stock  options under Section 422 of
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),  nonqualified stock options,
or stock appreciation rights.

     The Plan and the 2001  Option  Plan are  administered  by the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company,  comprised of directors  who
satisfy  the  "non-employee"  director  requirements  of Rule  16b-3  under  the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and the "outside director" provision of Section
162(m) of the Code.  Grants  under  the Plan and the 2001  Option  Plan are made
pursuant to  individual  agreements  between the Company and each  grantee  that
specifies the terms of the grant, including the exercise price, exercise period,
vesting and other terms thereof.

Outside Directors Stock Option Plan

     The Company has an option plan for its outside  directors  (the  "Directors
Plan") that  provides for the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of
100,000  shares of common  stock of the Company to  directors of the Company who
are not and have not been employed by or acted as consultants to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  or affiliates  and who are not and have not been nominated to
the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to a contractual arrangement.  On
the date of the annual meeting of stockholders at which an eligible  director is
initially  elected,  each  eligible  director  is entitled to receive a one-time
grant of an option to purchase  6,000 shares  (12,000  shares if the director is




serving on a committee of the Board) of the Company's  Common Stock  exercisable
at the closing  price for a share of common stock on the date of grant.  Options
become exercisable  one-third each on the first, second and third anniversary of
the date of grant; provided that all options held by an eligible director become
fully and  immediately  exercisable  upon a change in  control  of the  Company.
Options granted under the Directors Plan that are not exercised generally expire
ten years after the date of grant. Option grants may be made under the Directors
Plan for ten years from the effective date of the Directors  Plan. The Directors
Plan is a "formula plan" so that a non-employee director's  participation in the
Directors  Plan does not  affect  his  status as a  "disinterested  person"  (as
defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Hansen Natural Corporation
Corona, California



We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Hansen Natural
Corporation and  subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001,  and 2000.  Our audits also
included  the  financial   statement   schedule  listed  in  Item  15(b).  These
consolidated  financial statements and this financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated  financial statements and this financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of Hansen Natural  Corporation  and
subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  2002  and  2001,  and the  results  of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and
2000 in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  presents  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other  intangible  assets as a
result  of  adopting  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  142,
"Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets",  effective  January 1, 2002.  As also
discussed  in Note 1,  effective  January  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  the
consensus  in  Emerging  Issues  Task Force  Issue No.  01-09,  "Accounting  for
Consideration  Given  by a Vendor  to a  Customer  (Including  a  Reseller  of a
Vendor's Products)" (EITF 01-09), resulting in the presentation of certain sales
promotion  expenses  and  customer  allowances  as a reduction  of net sales and
increase  of cost of sales  rather than  operating  expenses.  The  consolidated
financial  statements  for the years ended  December 31, 2001 and 2000 have been
revised to reclassify  such expenses and  allowances as a reduction of net sales
and  increase  of cost of  sales  consistent  with  the  2002  presentation,  in
accordance with EITF 01-09.

incorporation.  All intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

     Reclassifications  -  Certain  reclassifications  have  been  made  in  the
consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2002 presentation.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company  considers  certificates of deposit
with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash  and  cash
equivalents.

     Inventories  - Inventories  are valued at the lower of first-in,  first-out
(FIFO) cost or market value (net realizable value).




     Property  and  Equipment  -  Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost.
Depreciation of furniture, office equipment,  equipment and vehicles is based on
their  estimated  useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated  using the
straight-line  method.  Amortization  of leasehold  improvements is based on the
lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is
calculated using the straight-line method.

     Trademark  License  and  Trademarks  -  Trademark  license  and  trademarks
represents the Company's  exclusive  ownership of the  Hansen's(R)  trademark in
connection with the  manufacture,  sale and  distribution of beverages and water
and non-beverage  products.  The Company also owns in its own right, a number of
other trademarks in the United States as well as in a number of countries around
the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky(R)  trademark,  which was acquired
in September 2000, and the Junior Juice(R) trademark,  which was acquired in May
2001 (Note 2). The Company amortizes its trademark license and trademarks over 1
to 40 years. The adoption of SFAS No. 142, as described  below,  resulted in the
elimination  of  amortization  of  indefinite  life  assets,  which  reduced the
trademark amortization expense recognized by the Company in 2002.

     Long-Lived Assets- Management  regularly reviews property and equipment and
other  long-lived  assets,  including  certain  identifiable  intangibles,   for
possible impairment.  This review occurs annually,  or more frequently if events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable.  If there is  indication of impairment of property and equipment or
amortizable  intangible assets,  then management  prepares an estimate of future
cash flows  (undiscounted  and without interest charges) expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If these cash flows are less
than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write
down the asset to its estimated  fair value.  The fair value is estimated at the
present value of the future cash flows  discounted at a rate  commensurate  with
management's  estimates of the business risks. Annually, or earlier, if there is
indication  of  impairment  of  identified  intangible  assets  not  subject  to
amortization,  management  compares the  estimated  fair value with the carrying
amount  of the  asset.  An  impairment  loss is  recognized  to  write  down the
intangible  asset to its  fair  value if it is less  than the  carrying  amount.
Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and
is based on management's best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future
conditions. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2002.

     Revenue  Recognition - The Company  records revenue at the time the related
products are shipped and the risk of ownership has passed.  Management  believes
an adequate  provision  against net sales has been made for  estimated  returns,
allowances and cash discounts based on the Company's historical experience.

     Freight  Costs and  Reimbursement  of Freight  Costs - In  accordance  with
Emerging  Issues Task Force  ("EITF")  No.  00-10,  Accounting  for Shipping and
Handling Fees and Costs,  reimbursements  of freight charges are recorded in net
sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000,  freight-out  costs amounted to $5.8 million,
$4.2 million, and $4.1 million, respectively, and have been recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the accompanying  consolidated statements
of income.

     Advertising  and  Promotional   Allowances  -  The  Company   accounts  for
advertising  production  costs by expensing such production costs the first time
the related advertising takes place.  Advertising  expenses included in selling,
general and administrative  expenses amounted to $7.3 million, $4.3 million, and
$5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
In addition, the Company supports its customers,  including  distributors,  with
promotional  allowances,  a  portion  of which is  utilized  for  marketing  and
indirect  advertising by them.  Such  promotional  allowances  amounted to $13.5
million,  $12.2 million, and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Change  in  Accounting  for  Promotional  Allowances  - Prior to 2002,  the
Company   included  its   promotional   allowances   in  selling,   general  and
administrative  expenses.  Effective  the first  quarter  of 2002,  the  Company




adopted the consensus of the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's  ("FASB")
EITF No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a
Reseller of the Vendor's Products, which addresses various issues related to the
income  statement  classification  of certain  promotional  payments,  including
consideration  from a vendor to a reseller or another  party that  purchases the
vendor's  products.  EITF No.  01-9 was  issued in  November  2001 and  codified
earlier  pronouncements.  The consensus  requires  certain sales  promotions and
customer allowances previously classified as selling, general and administrative
expenses to be  classified as a reduction of net sales or as cost of goods sold.
The Company  adopted EITF No. 01-9 on January 1, 2002.  The effect of the change
in  accounting  related  to the  adoption  of EITF No.  01-9 for the year  ended
December 31, 2002 was to decrease  net sales by  $14,846,875,  increase  cost of
goods sold by $220,394 and decrease selling, general and administrative expenses
by  $15,067,269.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  for the years  ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000 have been  revised to  reclassify  such  expenses and
allowances  as a  reduction  of net  sales  and  increase  of cost of  sales  in
accordance with EITF 01-9. For the year ended December 31, 2001, $11,621,396 has
been  reclassified  as a reduction  to net sales and  $341,332 as an increase in
cost of sales,  both of which were previously  reported as selling,  general and
administrative  expense.  For the year ended  December 31, 2000,  $8,026,724 has
been  reclassified  as a reduction  of net sales and  $133,390 as an increase in
cost of sales,  both of which were previously  reported as selling,  general and
administrative expense.

     Income Taxes - The Company  accounts for income taxes under the  provisions
of SFAS No. 109,  Accounting  for Income  Taxes.  This  statement  requires  the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  for the future  consequences
of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax
returns.  Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the
event the future  consequences of differences  between financial reporting bases
and tax bases of the Company's  assets and liabilities  result in a deferred tax
asset,  SFAS No. 109 requires an evaluation of the  probability of being able to
realize  the future  benefits  indicated  by such asset.  A valuation  allowance
related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

     Stock Based  Compensation - The Company accounts for its stock option plans
in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
(APB Opinion No. 25) and related  Interpretations.  Under APB Opinion No. 25, no
compensation  expense is recognized  because the exercise price of the Company's
employee stock options  equals the market price of the  underlying  stock at the
date of the grant.  In December 2002,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS
No.  123,  Accounting  for  Stock-based  Compensation,  (SFAS  No.  123)  and is
effective  immediately upon issuance.  SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods
of  transition  for a  voluntary  change  to the  fair  value  based  method  of
accounting  for  stock-based  employee  compensation  as  well as  amending  the
disclosure  requirements  of  Statement  No. 123 to require  interim  and annual
disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based  compensation and the
effect  of the  method  used  on  reported  results.  The  Company  follows  the
requirements of APB Opinion No. 25 and the disclosure only provision of SFAS No.
123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. Had compensation  cost for the Company's option
plans  been  determined  based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in
the years 2000 through 2002  consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
Company's  net income and net income per common share would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts indicated below:




     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model  with the  following  weighted-average
assumptions used:

                                                 Risk-Free
        Dividend Yield   Expected Volatility   Interest Rate   Expected Lives
        --------------   -------------------   -------------   --------------
2002          0%                 8%                 4.6%           8 years
2001          0%                30%                 4.6%           6 years
2000          0%                48%                 6.0%           6 years

     Net Income Per Common Share - In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share,  net income per common share,  on a basic and diluted basis, is presented
for all  periods.  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted net income
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted  average  number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding,  if dilutive. Weighted
average  common  equivalent  shares  include  stock options and purchases of the
Company's common stock, held in treasury, using the treasury stock method.

     Concentration  Risk - Certain of the Company's  products utilize components
(raw materials and/or co-packing  services) from a limited number of sources.  A
disruption  in the  supply of such  components  could  significantly  affect the
Company's  revenues  from  those  products,   as  alternative  sources  of  such
components  may not be available at  commercially  reasonable  rates or within a
reasonably short time period.  The Company continues to take steps on an ongoing
basis to secure the availability of alternative  sources for such components and
minimize the risk of any disruption in production.

     One customer accounted for approximately 18%, 18%, and 23% of the Company's
sales for the years ended  December 31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  A
decision by that, or any other major customer,  to decrease the amount purchased
from the  Company  or to cease  carrying  the  Company's  products  could have a
material  adverse effect on the Company's  financial  condition and consolidated
results of operations.

     During 2002, 2001 and 2000,  sales outside of California  represented  42%,
39% and 37% of the aggregate sales of the Company, respectively.

     Credit Risk - The  Company  sells its  products  nationally,  primarily  to
retailers  and  beverage  distributors.  The  Company  performs  ongoing  credit
evaluations  of its  customers and generally  does not require  collateral.  The
Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses,  and historically,  such
losses have been within management's expectations.




     Fair Value of Financial  Instruments - SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial  Instruments,  requires  management to disclose the estimated
fair  value of  certain  assets  and  liabilities  defined  by SFAS  No.  107 as
financial  instruments.  At December  31,  2002,  management  believes  that the
carrying amount of cash,  accounts  receivable and accounts payable  approximate
fair  value  because  of the  short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.
Long-term debt bears interest at a rate comparable to the prime rate; therefore,
management  believes  the  carrying  amount for the  outstanding  borrowings  at
December 31, 2002 approximates fair value.

     Use of Estimates - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Segment Information - The Company's operating segments have been aggregated
into one reportable segment due to similarities of the economic  characteristics
and nature of  operations  among the  operations  represented  by the  Company's
various product lines.

     Change in Accounting for Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets - Effective
January 1, 2002,  the Company  adopted the  provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets.
This statement  discontinued the  amortization of goodwill and  indefinite-lived
intangible assets, subject to periodic impairment testing. Upon adoption of SFAS
No.  142,  the  Company  evaluated  the useful  lives of its  various  trademark
licenses and trademarks and concluded that certain of the trademark licenses and
trademarks have indefinite lives.  Unamortized trademark licenses and trademarks
ceased to be  amortized  effective  January  1, 2002 and are  subject  to annual
impairment  analysis.  Had the  non-amortization  provision of SFAS No. 142 been
adopted as of January 1, 2000, net income and net income per share for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 would have been adjusted as follows:



     On January 1, 2002 and  December  31,  2002,  the  trademark  licenses  and
trademarks  were tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS




No. 142. Fair values were estimated  based on the Company's best estimate of the
expected  present value of future cash flows.  No amounts were impaired at those
times.  In  addition,  the  remaining  useful  lives of  trademark  licenses and
trademarks  being  amortized  were  reviewed and deemed to be  appropriate.  The
following provides  additional  information  concerning the Company's  trademark
licenses and trademarks as of December 31:

                                                        2002           2001

     All  amortizing  trademark  licenses and  trademarks  have been assigned an
estimated  finite useful life, and are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over
the number of years that approximate  their respective useful lives ranging from
1 to 40 years (weighted average life of 30 years).  The straight-line  method of
amortization  allocates  the cost of the  trademark  licenses and  trademarks to
earnings  in  proportion  to the amount of  economic  benefits  obtained  by the
Company in that report period.  Total amortization expense during the year ended
December  31,  2002 was  $54,558.  As of December  31,  2002,  future  estimated
amortization  expense  related to amortizing  trademark  licenses and trademarks
through the year ended December 31, 2008 is:

             2003                                       $41,330
             2004                                        38,105
             2005                                        38,105
             2006                                        37,990
             2007                                        32,745



     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for
the  Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets,  effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. The new rules on asset  impairment  supersede
FASB Statement No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and
for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of, and provide a single  accounting model
for  long-lived  assets to be disposed of. The Company has performed an analysis
and determined that the adoption of this Statement had no effect on the earnings
or financial position of the Company.

     In  April  2002 the FASB  issued  Statement  No.  145,  Rescission  of FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44 and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections,  effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. For most
companies, Statement No. 145 will require gains and losses on extinguishments of
debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing  operations  rather than
as   extraordinary   items  as  previously   required  under  Statement  No.  4.
Extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided
in APB Opinion No. 30. Statement No. 145 also amends Statement No. 13 to require
certain  modifications  to capital  leases be treated  as a  sale-leaseback  and
modifies  the  accounting  for  sub-leases  when the original  lessee  remains a
secondary obligor (or guarantor).  In addition, the FASB rescinded Statement No.
44, which  addressed the accounting for intangible  assets of motor carriers and
made numerous  technical  corrections.  The Company has not yet  determined  the
effect, if any, of the adoption of this Statement.




     In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal  Activities,  which  addresses  financial  accounting  and
reporting for costs  associated with exit or disposal  activities and supersedes
EITF No. 94-3,  Liability  Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits
and Other  Costs to Exit an  Activity  (including  Certain  Costs  Incurred in a
Restructuring.)  SFAS No. 146 requires  that a liability  for a cost  associated
with an exit or disposal  activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF No.  94-3,  a liability  for an exit cost as defined in EITF No. 94-3
was recognized at the date of an entity's  commitment to an exit plan.  SFAS No.
146 also  establishes  that the  liability  should  initially  be  measured  and
recorded at fair value.  The Company will adopt the  provisions  of SFAS No. 146
for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002.

     In  December  2002  the FASB  issued  Statement  No.  148,  Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation-Transition and Disclosure,  effective for fiscal years
ending after  December 15, 2002.  Statement  No. 148 amends  Statement  No. 123,
Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,  to provide  alternative  methods of
transition  to  Statement  No.  123's  fair  value  method  of  accounting   for
stock-based employee compensation.  Statement No. 148 also amends the disclosure
provisions  of  Statement  No. 123 and APB  Opinion  No. 28,  Interim  Financial
Reporting,  to  require  disclosure  in the  summary of  significant  accounting
policies  of the  effects  of an  entity's  accounting  policy  with  respect to
stock-based employee  compensation on reported net income and earnings per share
in annual and interim  financial  statements.  The Company has adopted Statement
No.  148 as of  December  31,  2002 and has  complied  with  the new  disclosure
requirements.

     In  November  2002 the  FASB  issued  Interpretation  No.  45,  Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others ("FIN No. 45").  FIN No. 45 clarifies and
expands on existing  disclosure  requirements  for  guarantees,  including  loan
guarantees.  It also would require  that,  at the inception of a guarantee,  the
Company must  recognize a liability for the fair value of its  obligation  under
that guarantee.  The initial fair value  recognition and measurement  provisions
will be applied on a prospective basis to certain  guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002.  The disclosure  provisions are effective for financial
statements of periods  ending after  December 15, 2002 (Note 6).The Company does
not  expect  that  the  adoption  of the  initial  recognition  and  measurement
provisions of FIN No. 45 will have a material impact on its financial  position,
cash flows or results of operations.

     In January 2003 the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 46,  Consolidation  of
Variable Interest Entities,  an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN No. 46"). FIN
No. 46 requires  certain  variable  interest  entities to be consolidated by the
primary  beneficiary of the entity if the equity  investors in the entity do not
have the  characteristics  of a  controlling  financial  interest or do not have
sufficient  equity at risk for the  entity to  finance  its  activities  without
additional  subordinated  financial  support  from  other  parties.  FIN  46  is
effective  for all new  variable  interest  entities  created or acquired  after
January 31, 2003. For variable  interest  entities  created or acquired prior to
February  1, 2003,  the  provisions  of FIN No. 46 must be applied for the first
interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. Since the Company has no
interests in variable  interest  entities,  the Company does not expect that the
adoption of FIN No. 46 will have a material  impact on its  financial  position,
cash flows or results of operations.

2.       ACQUISITIONS

     On  September  20,  2000,  the Company  acquired  through its  wholly-owned
subsidiary,  Blue Sky, the beverage business of BSNBC, including the Blue Sky(R)
trademarks  and certain other assets for a purchase  price of $6.5 million.  The
Blue  Sky(R)  products  include  a range of  all-natural  carbonated  sodas  and
seltzers  that  are  marketed  throughout  the  United  States  and  in  certain
international  markets,  principally to the health food trade.  On May 25, 2001,
the Company  acquired  through its  subsidiary  Junior  Juice,  the Junior Juice
beverage  business  of  Pasco  Juices,   Inc.,  including  the  Junior  Juice(R)
trademarks  and  assumption  of  certain  liabilities  for a  purchase  price of
$946,677.  The Junior Juice(R) products are comprised of 100% juices targeted at
toddlers.




     The  acquisitions  have been accounted for as purchases in accordance  with
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion  ("APB") No. 16,  Business  Combinations.
Accordingly,  the purchase prices,  inclusive of certain acquisition costs, were
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on a valuation of
their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.  The purchase price for
the  acquisition  of Blue Sky,  inclusive  of  certain  acquisition  costs,  was
financed  through the Company's credit facility (Note 5). The purchase price for
the  acquisition  of Junior Juice was financed by the issuance of a note payable
to Pasco  Juice,  Inc.,  payable over five years and the  assumption  of certain
liabilities (Note 5).

     Trademarks acquired are evaluated and amortized in accordance with SFAS No.
142. The  operating  results of Blue Sky and Junior Juice have been  included in
the Company's results of operations since the respective dates of acquisition.

3.       INVENTORIES

     Inventories consist of the following at December 31:

                                                2002                2001

5. LONG-TERM DEBT

     In 1997,  HBC  obtained a credit  facility  from  Comerica  Bank-California
("Comerica"),  consisting  of a revolving  line of credit and a term loan.  Such
revolving  line of credit  and term loan were  secured by  substantially  all of
HBC's assets, including accounts receivable,  inventory,  trademarks,  trademark
licenses  and  certain  equipment.  In 2000,  HBC  entered  into a  modification
agreement with Comerica to amend certain  provisions under the above facility in
order to finance the acquisition of the Blue Sky business,  repay the term loan,
and provide additional working capital ("Modification  Agreement").  Pursuant to
the Modification Agreement,  the revolving line of credit was increased to $12.0
million,  reducing to $6.0  million by September  2004.  The  revolving  line of
credit  remains in full force and effect  through  September  2005.  Interest on
borrowings  under the line of credit is based on the bank's base  (prime)  rate,
plus  an  additional  percentage  of up to  0.5%  or the  LIBOR  rate,  plus  an
additional  percentage of up to 2.5%, depending upon certain financial ratios of
the Company.

     The initial use of proceeds under the Modification Agreement was to pay the
seller in connection with the acquisition of the Blue Sky business, to repay the
remaining  $807,000  balance  due under the term loan and to provide  additional
working capital. The Company's  outstanding  borrowings on the line of credit at
December 31, 2002 were $3.0 million.




     The credit facility contains financial  covenants which require the Company
to  maintain  certain  financial  ratios and  achieve  certain  levels of annual
income. The facility also contains certain non-financial  covenants. At December
31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

     During 2000,  the Company  entered into capital  leases for  acquisition of
certain  vehicles,  payable  over a  five-year  period and  having an  effective
interest rate of 8.8%. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the assets  acquired under
capital leases had a net book value of $285,085 and $402,387, net of accumulated
depreciation of $301,422 and $184,120, respectively.


     Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31:


     Long-term debt is payable as follows:

              Year ending December 31:

                                                     =============

     Interest expense amounted to $224,748, $520,160 and $380,651, for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Operating Leases - The Company leases its warehouse  facility and corporate
offices under a 10 year lease  beginning  October  2000,  when the Company first
occupied  the  facility.  The  facility  lease and certain  equipment  and other
non-cancelable  operating  leases expire  through 2010.  The facility  lease has
scheduled rent increases which are accounted for on a straight-line  basis. Rent
expense under such leases amounted to $643,827,  $644,454,  and $416,505 for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.




     Future  minimum  rental  payments  at  December  31,  2002 under the leases
referred to above are as follows:

              Year ending December 31:
              2003                                       $    653,727

                                                        ==============

     Employment  and  Consulting  Agreements  - On January 1, 1999,  the Company
entered  into an  employment  agreement  with  Rodney  C.  Sacks  and  Hilton H.
Schlosberg pursuant to which Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg render services to the
Company as its  Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer,  and its Vice  Chairman,
President and Chief Financial Officer,  respectively. The agreements provide for
an annual base salary of $180,000  each,  increasing by a minimum of 8% for each
subsequent  twelve-month  period during the  employment  period,  plus an annual
bonus in an amount determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the
Company as well as certain fringe benefits for the period commencing  January 1,
1999 and ending December 31, 2003. After such date, such agreements  provide for
automatic  annual renewals unless written notice is delivered to each of them by
June 30, 2003 or any subsequent June 30 thereafter.

     Litigation  - The  Company  is  subject  to, and  involved  in,  claims and
contingencies  related to lawsuits and other  matters  arising out of the normal
course of  business.  The  ultimate  liability  associated  with such claims and
contingencies,  if any, is not likely to have a material  adverse  effect on the
financial condition of the Company.

     Guarantees  - The Company  from time to time enters into  certain  types of
contracts that  contingently  require the Company to indemnify  parties  against
third party claims.  These contracts primarily relate to: (i) certain agreements
with the Company's officers, directors and employees under which the Company may
be required to  indemnify  such  persons  for  liabilities  arising out of their
employment  relationship,  (ii)  certain  purchase  agreements  under  which the
Company may have to indemnify the Company's customers from any claim,  liability
or loss  arising  out of any actual or alleged  injury or  damages  suffered  in
connection with the consumption or purchase of the Company's products, and (iii)
certain real estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify
property  owners for liabilities and other claims arising from the Company's use
of the applicable premises.

     The terms of such obligations vary. Generally,  a maximum obligation is not
explicitly  stated.  Because the obligated  amounts of these types of agreements
often are not explicitly  stated,  the overall maximum amount of the obligations
cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the Company believes that its insurance
cover is  adequate  to cover  any  liabilities  or  claims  arising  out of such
instances referred to above. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to
make  significant  payments for these  obligations and no liabilities  have been
recorded for these obligations on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2002.

8. STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     The Company has three stock option plans,  the Hansen  Natural  Corporation
2001 Stock Option Plan ("2001  Option  Plan"),  the  Employee  Stock Option Plan
("the Plan") and the Outside Directors Stock Option Plan ("Directors Plan").

     During 2001, the Company  adopted the 2001 Stock Option Plan which provides
for the grant of options to purchase up to 2,000,000  shares of the common stock
of the Company to certain  key  employees  of the Company and its  subsidiaries.




Options  granted under the 2001 Option Plan may be incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"),  nonqualified
stock options,  or stock appreciation  rights.  Stock options are exercisable at
such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of  Directors  of the Company up to a ten-year  period after their date of
grant.  As of December 31, 2002,  options to purchase  529,500  shares of Hansen
common stock had been granted under the 2001 Option Plan and options to purchase
1,433,500  shares of Hansen  common stock remain  available  for grant under the
2001 Option Plan.

     The Plan, as amended,  provided for the granting of options to purchase not
more than  3,000,000  shares  of Hansen  common  stock to key  employees  of the
Company and its subsidiaries through July 1, 2001. Stock options are exercisable
at such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation  Committee of
the Board of Directors  of the Company up to a ten-year  period after their date
of grant,  and no options may be granted  after July 1, 2001.  The option  price
will not be less than the fair market value at the date of grant. As of December
31, 2002,  options to purchase  2,111,700 shares of Hansen common stock had been
granted under the Plan, net of options that have expired.

     The  Directors  Plan  provides  for the grant of options to  purchase up to
100,000  shares of common  stock of the Company to  directors of the Company who
are not and have not been employed by or acted as consultants to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  or affiliates  and who are not and have not been nominated to
the Board of Directors of the Company (the  "Board")  pursuant to a  contractual
arrangement.  On the date of the  annual  meeting of  shareholders,  at which an
eligible  director is initially  elected,  each eligible director is entitled to
receive a one-time grant of an option to purchase 6,000 shares (12,000 shares if
the  director is serving on a committee  of the Board) of the  Company's  common
stock,  exercisable one-third each on the first, second and third anniversary of
the date of grant;  provided,  however,  that options granted as of February 14,
1995,  are  exercisable  66 2/3% on the date of grant and 100% on July 8,  1995;
provided,  further,  that all options held by an eligible  director become fully
and  immediately  exercisable  upon a change in control of the Company.  Options
granted under the Directors  Plan that are not  exercised  generally  expire ten
years  after the date of grant.  Option  grants may be made under the  Directors
Plan for ten years from the effective date of the Directors  Plan. The Directors
Plan is a "formula" plan so that a non-employee director's  participation in the
Directors  Plan does not  affect  his  status as a  "disinterested  person"  (as
defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). As of December
31,  2002,  options to purchase  36,000  shares of Hansen  common stock had been
granted under the Directors Plan and options to purchase 64,000 shares of Hansen
common stock remained available for grant.

     For the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001, and 2000, the Company granted
529,500,  122,500,  and 189,000  options to purchase  shares under the Plan, the
2001 Option Plan, and Directors Plan at a weighted average grant date fair value
of $1.33, $1.36, and $2.26,  respectively.  Additional information regarding the
plans is as follows:




     The following table summarizes  information about fixed-price stock options
outstanding at December 31, 2002:



9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

     Employees  of Hansen  Natural  Corporation  may  participate  in the Hansen
Natural  Corporation  401(k) Plan, a defined  contribution plan, which qualifies
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Participating  employees may
contribute up to 15% of their pretax salary up to statutory limits.  The Company
contributes  25% of  the  employee  contribution,  up to 8% of  each  employee's
earnings.  Matching  contributions  were $64,949,  $58,211,  and $49,323 for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively.

10. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

to the  Company.  Expenses  incurred to such firm in  connection  with  services
rendered to the Company during the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000
were $79,843, $193,350, and $180,954, respectively.

in  connection  with  promotional  materials  purchased  during the years  ended
December  31,  2002,  2001 and  2000  were  $164,199,  $164,638,  and  $115,520,
respectively.
