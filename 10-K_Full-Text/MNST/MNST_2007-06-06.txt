BUSINESS

Overview

Hansen Natural Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on April 25,
1990. Our principal place of business is at 1010 Railroad Street, Corona,
California 92882 and our telephone number is (951) 739-6200.  When this report uses the words “Hansen”,  “HBC”, “the Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”,
these words refer to Hansen Natural Corporation and our subsidiaries other than
Monster LDA Company (“MLDA”), unless the context otherwise requires.

We are a holding company and carry on no operating business except
through our direct wholly owned subsidiaries, Hansen Beverage Company (“HBC”)
which was incorporated in Delaware on June 8, 1992, and MLDA, formerly known as
Hard e Beverage Company, and previously known as Hard Energy Company and as CVI
Ventures, Inc., which was incorporated in Delaware on April 30, 1990.

HBC generates all of
our operating revenues.

We develop,
market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category natural sodas,
fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit
juice smoothies and “functional drinks,” non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced
teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks, Junior
Juice® juices and non-carbonated lightly flavored energy waters under the
Hansen’s® brand name.  We also develop,
market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names;
Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy™, Joker Mad Energy™, Unbound Energy® and Ace™
brand names as well as Rumba™ brand energy juice.  We also market, sell and distribute Java
Monster™ non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks.  We also market, sell and distribute natural
sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer
waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue Sky® brand name. Our
fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under the Junior Juice® brand name.  We also market, sell and distribute vitamin and
mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the Fizzit™ brand name.

The Company has two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”),
whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and the Warehouse segment (“Warehouse”),
whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD
segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive
distributor network whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells
products primarily directly to retailers.

Corporate
History

In the 1930’s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons started a business to
sell fresh non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles, California.  This business eventually became Hansen’s
Juices, Inc., which subsequently became known as The Fresh Juice Company of
California, Inc. (“FJC”).  FJC retained
the right to market and sell fresh non-pasteurized juices under the Hansen
trademark.  In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of
the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a demand for pasteurized natural
juices and juice blends that are shelf stable and formed Hansen Foods, Inc. (“HFI”).
HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen’s Natural
Sodas®.  California Co-Packers
Corporation (d/b/a/ Hansen Beverage Company) (“CCC”) acquired certain assets of
HFI, including the right to market the Hansen’s® brand name, in January
1990.  On July 27, 1992, HBC acquired the
Hansen’s® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC.  Under our ownership, the Hansen beverage
business has significantly expanded and includes a wide range of beverages
within the growing “alternative” beverage category including in particular,
energy drinks. In September 1999, we acquired all of FJC’s rights to
manufacture, sell and distribute fresh non-pasteurized juice products under the
Hansen’s® trademark together with certain additional rights.  In 2000, HBC, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co. (“Blue Sky”), which was incorporated
in Delaware on September 8, 2000, acquired the natural soda business previously
conducted by Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co., a New Mexico


corporation (“BSNBC”),
under the Blue Sky® trademark.  In 2001,
HBC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Hansen Junior Juice Company, (“Junior
Juice”), which was incorporated in Delaware on May 7, 2001, acquired the Junior
Juice business previously conducted by Pasco Juices, Inc. (“Pasco”) under the
Junior Juice® trademark.

Industry
Overview

The alternative beverage category combines non-carbonated
ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single serve juices and
fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks, energy drinks, sports
drinks, and single-serve still water (flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with “new
age” beverages, including sodas that are considered natural, sparkling juices
and flavored sparkling waters.  The
alternative beverage category is the fastest growing segment of the beverage
marketplace according to Beverage Marketing Corporation. According to Beverage
Marketing Corporation, wholesale sales in 2006 for the alternative beverage
category of the market are estimated at $22.0 billion representing a growth
rate of approximately 14.5% over the estimated wholesale sales in 2005 of
approximately $19.2 billion.

Reportable
Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal
products comprise energy drinks and Warehouse, whose principal products
comprise juice based and soda beverages. 
The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through
an exclusive distributor network whereas the Warehouse segment develops,
markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers.  Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not
relate to the DSD or Warehouse segments specifically have been allocated to “Corporate
& Unallocated.”

For financial information about our reporting segments and geographic
areas, refer to Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set
forth in Part II, Item 8.  “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report, incorporated herein by reference.  For certain risks with respect to our energy
drinks see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below.

Products

Natural Sodas.

Hansen’s Natural Sodas® have been a leading natural
soda brand in Southern California for the past 25 years.  In 2006, according to Information Resources,
Inc.’s Analyzer Reports for California, our natural sodas recorded the highest
sales among comparable carbonated new age category beverages measured by unit
volume in the California market. Our natural sodas are available in fourteen regular
flavors consisting of mandarin lime, key lime, grapefruit, raspberry, ginger
ale, creamy root beer, grapefruit, vanilla cola, cherry vanilla creme, orange
mango, kiwi strawberry, tropical passion, black cherry and tangerine.  In early 2001, we introduced a new line of
diet sodas using Splenda® sweetener as the primary sweetener.  We initially introduced this line in four
flavors: peach, black cherry, tangerine lime, and kiwi strawberry, and have
since added three additional flavors: ginger ale, creamy root beer and
grapefruit.  Our natural sodas contain no
preservatives, sodium, caffeine or artificial coloring and are made with high
quality natural flavors, citric acid and high fructose corn syrup or, in the
case of diet sodas, with Splenda® and Acesulfame-K.  We package our natural sodas in 12-ounce
aluminum cans.  In 2002, we introduced a
line of natural mixers in 8-ounce aluminum cans comprising club soda, tonic
water and ginger ale

.

In January 1999,
we introduced a premium line of Signature Sodas in unique proprietary 14-ounce
glass bottles.  This line was marketed
under the Hansen’s® brand name, primarily through our distributor network, in
six flavors.  In early 2003, we
repositioned this line into lower cost 12-ounce glass packaging to market our repositioned
Signature Soda line at lower price points directly to our retail customers such
as grocery chains, club stores, specialty retail chains and mass merchandisers
and to the health food sector through specialty and health food distributors
(collectively referred to as our “direct retail customers”).  Signature Soda is available in 12-ounce glass
bottles in four flavors: orange crème, vanilla crème, ginger beer and
sarsaparilla.


In September 2000,
we acquired the Blue Sky® natural soda business from BSNBC.  Our Blue Sky® product line comprises natural
sodas, premium sodas, organic natural sodas, seltzer water, energy drinks, tea
sodas and isotonic sports drinks.  Blue
Sky® natural sodas are available in twelve regular flavors consisting of lemon
lime, grapefruit, cola, root beer, raspberry, cherry vanilla creme, Jamaican
ginger ale, black cherry, orange creme, Dr. Becker, grape and cream soda.  We also offer a premium line of Blue Sky®
natural sodas which contain supplements such as ginseng.  This line is available in six flavors
consisting of ginseng creme, ginseng cola, ginseng root beer, ginseng very
berry creme, ginseng ginger ale, and ginseng cranberry raspberry.  During 1999, Blue Sky® introduced a line of
organic natural sodas, which are available in six flavors consisting of lemon
lime cream, new century cola, orange divine, ginger ale, black cherry cherish,
and root beer.  We also market a seltzer
water under the Blue Sky® label in three flavors: natural, lime and lemon.  In 2002, we introduced a lightly carbonated
Blue Sky® energy drink in an 8.3-ounce slim can.  In 2006, we introduced a 16-ounce size of
Blue Energy as well as both an 8.3-ounce and 16-ounce size of Blue Sky Juiced
Energy, which is lightly carbonated and contains 50% juice.  In 2004, we introduced a new line of Blue
Sky® natural tea sodas in four flavors consisting of Imperial Lime Green Tea,
Peach Mist Green Tea, Pomegranate White Tea and Raspberry Red Tea.  The Blue Sky® products contain no
preservatives, sodium or caffeine (other than the energy drink) or artificial
coloring and are made with high quality natural flavors. Blue Sky® natural
sodas, seltzer waters and tea sodas are all packaged in 12-ounce aluminum cans
and are marketed primarily to our direct retail customers.  In March 2005, we introduced a new light line
of Blue Sky® sodas using natural sweeteners in four flavors: cherry vanilla
crème, creamy root beer, Jamaican ginger ale and wild raspberry in 12-ounce
cans.  In the third quarter of 2005, we
introduced a new line of Blue Sky® natural sodas with real sugar in 12-ounce
cans in four flavors: cherry vanilla crème, cola, ginger ale and root
beer.  In December 2005, we introduced a
new line of Blue Sky® isotonic sports drinks in 16-ounce polyethylene
terephthalate (“PET”) plastic bottles in three flavors: orange, lemon lime and
fruit punch.

In 2001, we
introduced a new line of sparkling lemonades (regular and pink) and orangeades
in unique proprietary 1-liter glass bottles and towards the end of 2002, we
introduced diet versions of these products. In 2003, we extended this line into
unique proprietary 12-ounce glass bottles in both regular and diet
versions.  This product line was marketed
to our direct retail customers.  The
contract packer who produced these products on our behalf underwent a change of
ownership, and experienced production difficulties in 2003, and as a result we
discontinued this product line.  We are
currently evaluating alternative packages for this line.

In 2006, we
introduced a new line of Hansen’s green tea sodas under the Hansen® brand name
in 16-ounce aluminum cans that contain no preservatives, sodium, caffeine or
artificial colors, in four flavors; ginger, lemon mint, tangerine and
pomegranate.  We also introduced a diet
version that contains no carbohydrates or sugar in three flavors; tangerine,
lemon mint, ginger and in 2007, introduced an additional diet flavor,
pomegranate.

Hansen’s® Energy Drinks.

In 1997, we introduced a lightly
carbonated citrus flavored Hansen’s® energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans in 4 packs.
Our energy drink competes in the “functional” beverage category, namely,
beverages that provide a real or perceived benefit in addition to simply
delivering refreshment.   We also offered
additional functional energy drinks as well as other functional drinks
including a ginger flavored d-stress® drink, an orange flavored b-well™ drink,
a guarana berry flavored stamina® drink, a grape flavored power drink, and a
berry flavored “slim-down” drink that contained no calories, in the same size
cans.  We have since discontinued sales
of such functional products. Our energy drinks contain vitamins, minerals,
nutrients, herbs and supplements (collectively “supplements”).   In 2004, we offered our Hansen’s® energy
drink in 16-ounce cans which has subsequently been discontinued. In 2006, we
reintroduced our energy products through the Warehouse segment and introduced
Hansen’s® Energy Pro™ 8.3-ounce cans in four packs. In 2001, we introduced
Energade®, a non-carbonated energy sports drink in 23.5-ounce cans in two
flavors, citrus and orange,


and subsequently
introduced a third flavor, red rocker, which we have since discontinued.  In 2001 we also introduced E


O Energy Water®, a non-carbonated lightly flavored
water, in 24-ounce blue PET plastic bottles, in four flavors: tangerine, apple,
berry and lemon.   We subsequently
discontinued the apple flavor and introduced a green tea flavor in its
place.  In 2002, we expanded our E


O Energy Water® line with four additional flavors in
clear PET plastic bottles: mango melon, kiwi strawberry, grapefruit and green
tea.  We have since discontinued the E


O Energy Water® line in clear PET plastic bottles.  Our Energade® and E


O Energy Water® drinks also contain different
combinations and levels of supplements. At the end of 2002, we introduced a
lightly carbonated diet energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans under the Hansen’s Diet
Red Energy® brand name.  Our Diet Red
Energy® energy drink is sweetened with Splenda® and Acesulfame-K.  We market our energy and Energade® drinks
primarily through our full service distributor network.  We market our E


O
Energy Water® drinks in blue bottles to our direct retail customers and are
currently in the process of revaluating this line. In 2003, we introduced a new
carbonated energy drink under the Hansen’s® Deuce brand name, in 16-ounce cans,
but with a different flavor from our existing Hansen’s® energy drinks in
8.3-ounce cans.  We have since
discontinued this product.

Monster Energy

®

Drinks.

In 2002, we launched a new
carbonated energy drink under the Monster Energy® brand name, in 16-ounce cans,
which was almost double the size of our regular energy drinks in 8.3-ounce cans
and the vast majority of competitive energy drinks on the market at that
time.  Our Monster Energy® drink contains
different types and levels of supplements than our Hansen’s® energy drinks and
is marketed through our full service distributor network.  In 2003, we introduced a low carbohydrate (“Lo-Carb”)
version of our Monster Energy® energy drink. 
In 2004, we introduced 4-packs of our Monster Energy® energy drinks
including our Lo-Carb version thereof and, towards the end of 2004, we launched
a new Monster Energy® Assault™ energy drink in 16-ounce cans.  During the first half of 2005, we introduced
our Monster Energy® drinks and Lo-Carb Monster Energy® in 24-ounce size cans as
well as Monster Energy®, Lo-Carb Monster Energy® and Monster Energy® Assault™
in 8.3-ounce size cans.  In September
2005, we introduced a new Monster Energy® Khaos™ energy drink in 16-ounce
cans.  Monster Energy® Khaos™ is lightly
carbonated and contains 70% juice. In 2006, we introduced our Monster Energy®
Assault™ and Monster Energy® Khaos™ energy drinks in 24-ounce size cans.  Also in 2006, we introduced Monster Energy®
Khaos™ energy drinks in 8.3-ounce size cans. 
During the first quarter 2007 we introduced a new Monster M-80™ energy
drink in 16-ounce size cans. Monster M-80™ energy drinks are lightly carbonated
and contain 80% juice.  We also
introduced Monster Energy® energy drinks in 8-packs.

Lost

®

Energy™ Drinks.

In 2004, we launched a new
carbonated energy drink under the Lost® brand name, in 16-ounce cans. Towards
the end of 2005, we introduced a lo-carb version of Lost® under the Perfect 10™
brand name as well as a new Lost® Five-O™ energy drink, all in 16-ounce
cans.  Lost® Five-O™ contains 50% juice
and is lightly carbonated.  In December
2005, we introduced Lost® and Lost® Five-O™ in 24-ounce size cans.  The Lost® brand name is owned by Lost
International LLC and the drinks are produced, sold and distributed by us under
exclusive license from Lost International LLC.

Rumba™
Energy Juice.

In
December 2004, we launched a new non-carbonated energy juice under the Rumba™
brand name in 15.5-ounce cans.  Rumba™
energy juice is a 100% juice product that targets male and female morning
beverage consumers and is positioned as a substitute for coffee, caffeinated
sodas and 100% orange or other juices.

Joker Mad
Energy

™

Drinks.

In the first quarter of 2005, we
introduced Joker Mad Energy™ energy drinks in 16-ounce cans.  Joker Mad Energy™ energy drinks come in
regular, lo-carb and juice versions in 16-ounce cans.

Ace™
Energy

Drinks.

In August 2006, we introduced Ace™
energy drinks in 16-ounce cans.  Ace™
energy drinks come in regular, lo-carb and juice versions in 16-ounce cans.


Unbound
Energy®

Drinks.

In October 2006, we acquired the
Unbound Energy® trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of

Unbound Energy

®

energy drinks
in 16-ounce cans. We subsequently introduced lo-carb and juice versions in
16-ounce cans.

Java
Monster™ Coffee Drinks

. In May 2007, we launched a new
non-carbonated dairy based coffee drink under the Java Monster™ brand name in
16-ounce cans.  Java Monster™ comes in
three versions, “Big Black,” “Loca Moca” and “Mean Bean.”

Juice
Products and Smoothies

.  Our fruit juice product line includes Hansen’s®
Natural Apple Juice, which is packaged in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles and
128-ounce polypropylene bottles and White Grape, White Grape Peach, Purple
Grape, Orange, Pomegranate, Apple Strawberry and Apple Grape juice blends, in
64-ounce PET plastic bottles.  These
Hansen’s® juice products contain 100% juice (except Pomegranate which contains
27% juice) as well as Vitamin C.  Hansen’s®
juice products compete in the shelf-stable juice category.  We also offer light juices (light grape,
cranberry and apple) and juice cocktails (apple medley, apple pear, apple berry
and apple white grape) in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles, as well as juice
cocktails (apple cranberry, apple white grape, apple berry and apple) in 32-ounce
PET plastic bottles.

In March 1995, we
introduced a line of fruit juice smoothie drinks in 11.5-ounce aluminum
cans.  Certain flavors were subsequently
offered in glass and PET plastic bottles. We have since discontinued offering
smoothies in glass and PET plastic bottle packages.  Hansen’s fruit juice smoothies have a smooth
texture that is thick but lighter than a nectar.  In 2006, we reformulated Hansen’s smoothies
by adding more fruit purees. Hansen’s smoothies in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans now
contain approximately 25% juice.  Our
fruit juice smoothies provide 100% of the recommended daily intake for adults
of Vitamins A, C & E and represented Hansen’s entry into what is commonly
referred to as the “functional” beverage category.  Hansen’s® fruit juice smoothies are available
in ten flavors: strawberry banana, peach berry, mango pineapple, guava
strawberry, pineapple coconut, apricot nectar, tropical passion, whipped
orange, as well as the blast line comprising Island Energy Blast and Colada
Energy Blast.  In 2004, we repositioned
our cranberry raspberry lite smoothie as part of our new lo-carb line of
smoothies.  Our lo-carb smoothie line
currently consists of peach, mango and cran-raspberry flavors in 12-ounce cans.

We market the
above juice and smoothie products to our direct retail customers.

Sparkling
Apple Cider

.  In 2002,
we introduced a Sparkling Cider 100% juice drink in a 1.5- liter Magnum glass
bottle.  However, due to reports of some
bottles breaking, we promptly voluntarily recalled this product in the fourth
quarter of 2003. We still intend to reevaluate relaunching this product once
certain production issues are resolved and a suitable co-packer has been
identified.

Iced Teas, Lemonades and Juice Cocktails.

We introduced Hansen’s® ready-to-drink
iced teas and lemonades in 1993 and juice cocktails in 1994 in 16-ounce glass
bottles.   At the end of 2002, we
converted this line from 16-ounce glass bottles to 16-ounce polypropylene
bottles. This line was discontinued in 2006.

In 1999, we introduced a line of specialty teas in 20-ounce glass
bottles, which we named our “Gold Standard” line.  This line was discontinued in 2006.

In 2006, we
introduced a new line of iced teas in sleek 16-ounce wide mouth PET plastic
bottles.  This line is sweetened with
cane sugar and includes green tea, peach green tea, lycee green tea and
pomegranate green tea.  In addition, we
offer a sugar free peach green tea with sucralose and an unsweetened black tea.

Juices for Children.

In 1999, we introduced two new lines of children’s
multi-vitamin juice drinks in 8.45-ounce aseptic boxes.  Each drink contains eleven essential vitamins
and six essential minerals.  We introduce
new flavors in place of existing flavors from time to time.  One of these two


lines is a
dual-branded 100% juice line named Juice Blast® that was launched in
conjunction with Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”) and is sold through
Costco stores.  The other line was a 10%
juice line named “Hansen’s Natural Multi-Vitamin Juice Slam®” that was
available to all of our customers. 
During 2000, we repositioned that line as a 100% juice line under the
Juice Slam® name and market that line to grocery store chain customers, the
health food trade, and other customers. 
Both the Juice Blast® and Juice Slam® lines are marketed in 6.75-ounce
aseptic boxes.  The Juice Slam® line has
four flavors and the Juice Blast® line has three flavors.

In 2003 we further
extended our fruit juice product line by introducing a 100% apple juice in
6.75-ounce aseptic pouches under the Apple Blasters™ brand.  In 2006 we discontinued our Apple Blasters™
product and repositioned our pouch line by introducing two Juice Slam® organic
pouches in organic apple and organic fruit punch flavors.

In May 2001, we
acquired the Junior Juice® beverage business. 
The Junior Juice® product line is comprised of seven flavors of 100%
juice in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers.  Six flavors of the Junior Juice® line have
calcium added and all flavors have vitamin C added. The current flavors in the
Junior Juice® line are apple, apple berry, orange twist, apple grape, mixed
fruit, fruit punch and white grape.

In 2006, we
extended the Junior Juice® line by adding organic apple and organic berry
medley juice products in 4.23-ounce aseptic boxes. Each of our organic Junior
Juice® products have 100% juice and contain 100% of the daily recommended
allowance of vitamin C and 10% of the daily recommended allowance of calcium.

Bottled Water.

Our still water products were introduced in 1993 and
are primarily sold in 0.5-liter plastic bottles to the food service trade.
Sales of this product line are very limited.

Fizzit™

Powdered Drink Mixes.

In
December 2005, we introduced a new line of vitamin and mineral drink mixes in
powdered form under the Fizzit™ brand name in both functional and vitamin and
mineral formulas.  The functional formulas
are offered in raspberry (joint formula), orange (immune support formula),
strawberry (immune support formula) and cranberry (women’s health
formula).  The vitamin and mineral
formula is offered in lemon line and strawberry flavors.

During 2006, we continued
to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets.  In particular, we continued to focus on
developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally
described as the “alternative” beverage category, with particular emphasis on
energy type drinks.

Other Products

We continue to evaluate
and, where considered appropriate, introduce additional flavors and other types
of beverages to complement our existing product lines.  We will also evaluate, and may, where considered
appropriate, introduce functional foods/snack foods that utilize similar
channels of distribution and/or are complementary to our existing products
and/or to which our brand names are able to add value.

We also develop
and supply, on a limited basis, selected beverages in different formats to a
limited number of customers with the objective of solidifying our relationship
with those customers.

Manufacture
and Distribution

We do not directly
manufacture our products but instead outsource the manufacturing process to
third party bottlers and contract packers.


We purchase
concentrates, juices, flavors, supplements, cans, bottles, aseptic boxes,
aseptic pouches, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our
beverage products which are delivered to our various third party bottlers and
co-packers.  Depending on the product,
the third party bottlers or packers add filtered water and/or high fructose
corn syrup, or sucrose, or cane sugar or Splenda® brand sweetener, Acesulfame-K
and/or citric acid or other ingredients and supplements for the manufacture and
packaging of the finished products into approved containers in accordance with
our formulas.  In the case of sodas and
other carbonated beverages, the bottler/packer adds carbonation to the products
as part of the production process.

We are generally
responsible for arranging for the purchase of and delivery to our third party
bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our beverage products are
packaged.

All of our
beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and
co-packers situated throughout the United States and Canada under separate
arrangements with each of such parties. 
The majority of our co-packaging arrangements are on a month-to-month
basis.  However, certain of our material
co-packing arrangements are described below:

In certain
instances, equipment is purchased by us and installed at the facilities of our
co-packers to enable them to produce certain of our products.  In general, such equipment remains our
property and is to be returned to us upon termination of the packing
arrangements with such co-packers or is amortized over a pre-determined number
of cases that are to be produced at the facilities concerned.

We pack certain
products outside of the West Coast region to enable us to produce products
closer to the markets where they are sold and thereby reduce freight
costs.  As volumes in markets outside of
California grow, we continue to secure additional packing arrangements closer to
such markets to further reduce freight costs.

Our ability to
estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products,
and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new
markets.  If we materially underestimate
demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw
materials including, but not limited to, glass, PET/plastic bottles, cans,
labels, flavors or supplement ingredients or certain sweeteners, or packing
arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis.

Although our
production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon
request, we believe a short disruption or delay would not significantly affect
our revenues since alternative packing facilities in the United States with
adequate capacity can usually be obtained for many of our products at
commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
period.  However, there are limited
packing facilities in the United States with adequate capacity and/or suitable
equipment for many of our newer products, including Hansen’s® brand energy
drinks in 8.3-ounce cans, aseptic juice products, Energade® in 24-ounce cans,
teas in 16-ounce PET/plastic bottles, Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy

™

, Rumba

TM

, Joker Mad Energy

TM

, Ace™, Unbound Energy® energy drinks in 8.3-, 15.5-,
16-, and 24-ounce cans and Java Monster™ coffee drinks in 16-ounce cans. A
disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly
affect our revenues from such products as alternative co-packing facilities in
the United States with adequate capacity may not be available for such products
either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
period, if at all.  Consequently, a disruption
in production of such products could affect our revenues.  We continue to seek alternative and/or
additional co-packing facilities in the United States or Canada with adequate
capacity for the production of our various products to minimize the risk of any
disruption in production.


On April 28, 2006,
HBC entered into a distribution agreement with Cadbury Bebidas, S.A. de C.V. (“Cadbury
Bebidas”), for exclusive distribution by Cadbury Bebidas throughout Mexico,
excluding Baja California, of our Monster Energy® and

Lost® Energy

TM

energy products.

On May 8, 2006,
HBC entered into the Monster Beverages Off-Premise Distribution Coordination
Agreement and the Allied Products Distribution Coordination Agreement (jointly,
the “Off-Premise Agreements”) with Anheuser-Busch, Inc., a Missouri corporation
(“AB”).  Under the Off-Premise
Agreements, select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the “AB Distributors”) will
distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s Monster Energy® and
Lost® Energy

TM

brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, Rumba™
brand energy juice and Unbound Energy® 
brand energy drinks, as well as additional products that may be agreed
between the parties.  We intend to
continue building our national distributor network primarily with select AB
distributors as well as with our sales force throughout 2007 to support and
grow the sales of our products.

Pursuant to the
Anheuser-Busch Distribution Agreements (the “AB Distribution Agreements”)
entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors, non-refundable payments
totaling $20.9 million were made to the Company by such newly appointed AB
Distributors for the costs of terminating the Company’s prior distributors
through December, 31, 2006. Such receipts have been accounted for as deferred
revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006
and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of
the respective AB Distribution Agreements.

As of December 31, 2006,
amounts totaling $3.3 million had been paid to the Company by certain other AB
Distributors in anticipation of executing AB Distribution Agreements with the
Company. Such receipts have been accounted for as customer deposit liabilities
in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2006.

Through December 31, 2006,
the Company incurred termination costs amounting to $12.7 million in aggregate
to certain of its prior distributors. Such termination costs have been expensed
in full and are included in operating expenses for the year ended December 31,
2006. Certain amounts totaling $7.0 million included in such termination costs
were not paid to our prior distributors before the end of our fiscal year and
are therefore included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2006.

On February 8,
2007, HBC entered into the On-Premise Distribution Coordination Agreement (the “On-Premise
Agreement”) with AB.  Under the
On-Premise Agreement, AB will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution and
merchandising of Monster Energy® energy drinks to on-premise retailers
including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by HBC.

On March 1, 2007, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with
Pepsi-QTG Canada, a division of PepsiCo Canada, ULC (“Pepsi Canada”), for the
exclusive distribution by Pepsi Canada throughout Canada of our

Monster
Energy®,

Lost® Energy

TM

, Hansen’s® and Joker Mad Energy™ energy
products.

Distribution
levels vary from state to state and from product to product.  Certain of our products are sold in Canada
and Mexico.  We also sell a limited range
of our products to distributors outside of the United States, including in the
Caribbean, Central and South America, Japan, Korea, and Saudi Arabia.

We continually seek
to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with
regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having
established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.  Many of our bottlers and distributors are
affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated
brands and other beverage products.  In
many cases, such products compete directly with our products.

We continue to
endeavor to reduce our inventory levels.


During 2006, we
continued to expand distribution of our natural sodas and smoothies outside of
California.  We expanded our national
sales force to support and grow sales, primarily of Monster Energy® drinks,
Lost® Energy

TM

, Ace

TM

, Unbound Energy®, and Joker
Mad Energy

TM

energy drinks, Rumba

TM

energy juice and Energade® energy sports
drinks and we intend to continue to build such sales force in 2007.

Our Blue Sky®
products are sold primarily to the health food trade, natural food chains and
mainstream grocery store chains, through specialty health food distributors.

During 2004, we entered into exclusive contracts with the State of
California (“State”) Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children
(“WIC”) Supplemental Nutrition Branch (“DHS”) to supply 100% apple juice and
100% blended juice in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles. The contracts commenced on
July 12, 2004 and were due to expire in July 2007.  The parties have mutually agreed to extend
the contracts until July 11, 2008.

Under these contracts Hansen’s is the exclusive supplier for both Apple
Juice and for the blended juice category, a new WIC category, initially with
our 100% Apple Grape Juice.  During 2005,
our Apple Strawberry Juice was approved within the blended juice category and
became eligible for redemption under the WIC contract in addition to our 100%
Apple Grape Juice.  The WIC contracts
have expanded the distribution of Hansen’s juices, resulting in increased
exposure for the Hansen’s® brand. 
WIC-approved items are stocked by the grocery trade and by WIC-only
stores.  Products are purchased by WIC
consumers with vouchers given by the DHS to qualified participants.

Our principal warehouse and distribution center and
corporate offices relocated to our current facility in October 2000.  In January 2004, we leased an additional
warehouse facility in Corona, California to consolidate additional space that
had been leased by us on short term leases from time to time to meet our
increased warehousing needs due to increases in both sales volumes and products
and terminated two short term leases concerned. This facility was subsequently
sublet on April 1, 2007. In June 2006, the Company leased additional warehouse
and office space in Corona, California for a one-year period. In October 2006,
we entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square
feet of warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona,
California.  This lease commitment
provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months commencing March 2007,
excluding renewal options.  The monthly
rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over
the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse
and distribution space will replace our existing warehouse and distribution
space located in Corona, California. We plan to sublet our existing office,
warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of the lease term, unless we
are able to find a tenant acceptable to the landlord and the landlord agrees to
the early termination of the lease.

In October 2006,
we also entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a
purchase price of $1.4 million, located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse
and distribution space in Corona, California for the purpose of constructing a
new office building which will replace our existing office space in Corona,
California. In the interim, we have leased additional office space located near
our existing corporate offices.  (See “Part
I Item 2 – Properties”).

Raw
Materials and Suppliers

The principal raw
materials used by us are aluminum cans, glass bottles and PET plastic bottles
as well as juices, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and sucralose, the costs
of which are subject to fluctuations. 
Due to the consolidations that have taken place in the glass industry
over the past few years, the prices of glass bottles continue to increase.  The prices of PET plastic bottles and
aluminum cans increased significantly in 2006 and again in 2007. The prices of
high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and certain juice concentrates, including
apple, increased in 2006 and certain of these ingredients continued to increase
in 2007.  These increased costs, together
with increased costs primarily of energy,


gas and
freight, resulted in increases in certain product costs which are ongoing and
are expected to continue to exert pressure on our gross margins in 2007.  We are uncertain whether the prices of these
or any other raw materials or ingredients will continue to rise in the future.

Generally, raw
materials utilized by us in our business are readily available from numerous
sources.  However, certain raw materials
are manufactured by only one company. 
Sucralose, which is used alone or in combination with Acesulfame-K in
the Company’s low-calorie products, is purchased by us from a single
manufacturer.  Certain of our cans are
only manufactured by a single company in the United States.

With regard to
fruit juice and juice-drink products, the industry is subject to variability of
weather conditions, which may result in higher prices and/or lower consumer
demand for juices.

We purchase
beverage flavors, concentrates, juices, supplements, high-fructose corn syrup,
cane sugar, sucrose, sucralose and other sweeteners as well as other
ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.

Generally, flavor
suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors.  Consequently, we do not have the list of
ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily
available to us and we may be unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates
from alternative suppliers on short notice. 
We have identified alternative suppliers of many of the supplements
contained in many of our beverages. 
However, industry-wide shortages of certain fruits and fruit juices, and
supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the
future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of
certain of our products.

We continually
endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavors and
concentrates from other suppliers as well as to conclude arrangements with
suppliers which would enable us to obtain access to certain concentrates or
flavor formulas in certain circumstances. 
We have been partially successful in these endeavors.  Additionally, in a limited number of cases,
contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals
and licenses may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative
suppliers and manufacturers and/or distributors.

In connection with
the development of new products and flavors, independent suppliers bear a large
portion of the expense of product development, thereby enabling us to develop
new products and flavors at relatively low cost.  We have historically developed and
successfully introduced new products and flavors and packaging for our products
and intend to continue developing and introducing additional new beverages and
flavors.

Competition

The beverage industry is
highly competitive.  The principal areas
of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors
and marketing campaigns.  Our products
compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of
manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing
and distribution resources than we do.

Important factors
affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of
products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of
new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded
product advertising and pricing.  We also
compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing our products over
those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution and secure
adequate shelf space in retail outlets. 
Competitive pressures in the alternative, energy and functional beverage
categories could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market
share or we could experience price erosion, which could have a material adverse
affect on our business and results.


Over the past five
years we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the
energy drink category.  A number of
companies who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in larger
volume packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass bottles, including Sobe,
Snapple Elements, Arizona and Fuse, have added supplements to their products
with a view to marketing their products as “functional” or “energy” beverages
or as having functional benefits.  We
believe that many of those products contain lower levels of supplements and
principally deliver refreshment.  In
addition, many competitive products are positioned differently than our energy
or functional drinks.  Our smoothies and
tea lines are positioned more closely against those products.

We compete not
only for consumer acceptance, but also for maximum marketing efforts by
multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors, many of which have a
principal affiliation with competing companies and brands.  Our products compete with all liquid
refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed
competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally
known producers such as The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc., Cadbury Schweppes
plc, Red Bull Gmbh, Kraft Foods, Inc., Nestle Beverage Company, Tree Top and
Ocean Spray. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local
in operation.  Our products also compete
with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains,
convenience store chains and club stores.

Our natural sodas
compete directly with traditional soda products including those marketed by The
Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc. and Cadbury Schweppes plc, as well as with
carbonated beverages marketed by smaller or primarily local companies such as
Jones Soda Co., Clearly Canadian Beverage Company, Crystal Geyser, J.M. Smucker
Company and with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store
chains, convenience store chains and club stores.

Our fruit juice
smoothies compete directly with Kern’s, Jumex, Jugos del Valle and Libby’s
nectars, V8 Smoothies, as well as with single serve juice products produced by
many competitors.  Such competitive
products are packaged in glass and PET bottles ranging from 8- to 48-ounces in
size and in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans. 
The juice content of such competitive products ranges from 1% to 100%.

Our apple and other juice products compete directly with Tree Top, Mott’s,
Martinelli’s, Welch’s, Ocean Spray, Tropicana, Minute Maid, Langers, Apple and
Eve, Seneca, Northland and also with other brands of apple juice and juice
blends, especially store brands.

Our energy drinks, including Hansen’s® energy, Diet Red, Monster
Energy®, Lost® Energy™, Joker Mad Energy™, Ace™ Energy, Unbound Energy® and
Rumba™ energy juice in 8.3-, 15.5-, 16- and 24-ounce cans, compete directly
with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full Throttle, No Fear, Amp, Adrenaline Rush, 180,
Extreme Energy Shot, Red Devil, Rip It, NOS, Boo Koo, and many other
brands.  The Coca-Cola Company and
PepsiCo Inc. also market and/or distribute additional products in that market
segment such as Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew MDX and Vault.

Our Java Monster™ coffee drinks compete directly with Starbucks
Frappuccino and other coffee drinks, Cinnabon coffee drinks and Godiva dairy
based drinks.

Our E


O Energy Water® and still water products
compete directly with Vitamin Water, Propel, Dasani, Aquafina, Fruit


O, Evian, Crystal Geyser, Naya, Palomar Mountain,
Sahara, Arrowhead, Dannon, and other brands of flavored water and still water,
especially store brands.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and
marketing strategy is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and
trial through sampling both in stores and at events in respect of all our
beverages and drink mixes.  We use our
branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events at which we
distribute our products to consumers for sampling.  We utilize “push-pull” methods to achieve
maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand
from consumers for our products including advertising,


in
store promotions and in store placement of point of sale materials and racks,
prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected
public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of
selected causes such as cancer research and SPCA’s as well as of extreme sports
teams such as the Pro Circuit – Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams,
Kawasaki Factory Motocross and Supercross teams, Alan Pflueger Desert Racing
Team, Kenny Bernstein Drag Racing Team, extreme sports figures and athletes,
sporting events such as the Monster Energy® Pipeline Pro Surfing competition,
marathons, 10k runs, bicycle races, volleyball tournaments and other health and
sports related activities, including extreme sports, particularly supercross,
freestyle motocross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing,
snowboarding, BMX, mountain biking, snowmobile racing, and also participate in
product demonstrations, food tasting and other related events.  Posters, print, radio and television
advertising together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote
our brands.

Additionally, in
2003 we entered into a multi-year sponsorship agreement to advertise on the new
Las Vegas Monorail (“Monorail Agreement”) with the Las Vegas Monorail Company (“LVMC”)
which includes the right to vend our Monster

Energy® drinks and natural sodas on all
stations.  The initial term of the
Monorail Agreement commenced on January 1, 2005 and has been renewed annually
thereafter.  We have renewed the
agreement for 2007 but at a lower annual rate.

We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation
such as making Hansen’s® products visually distinctive from other beverages on
the shelves of retailers.  We review our
products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to
make them different, better and unique. 
The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from
time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may
be placed in stores and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to
time.

Where appropriate
we partner with retailers to assist our marketing efforts.  For example, while we retain responsibility
for the marketing of the Juice Slam® line of children’s multi-vitamin juice
drinks, Costco has undertaken partial responsibility for the marketing of the
Juice Blast® line.

We increased
expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 50­­% in
2006 compared to 2005.  As of December
31, 2006, we employed 591 employees in sales and marketing activities, of which
231 were employed on a full-time basis.

Customers

Our customers are
typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug
chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage
distributors, health food distributors and food service customers.  Sales to our various customer types for 2006
are reflected below.  The allocations
below reflect changes made by the Company to the categories historically
reported.

Our customers
include Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group (formally known as Dr. Pepper
Bottling/7UP Bottling Group), Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), Kalil
Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Costco, Kroger,
Safeway and Albertsons.  A decision by
any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to cease
carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial
condition and consolidated results of operations.  Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group, a customer
of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 19%,18% and


13% of
our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD
and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 12% of our net sales for
the year ended December 31, 2006.

Seasonality

Sales
of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third
calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes.  The volume of sales in the beverage business
may be affected by weather conditions. 
Sales of our beverage products may become increasingly subject to
seasonal fluctuations as more sales occur outside of California with respect to
our products.  However, the energy drink
category appears to be less seasonal than traditional beverages.  As the percentage of our sales that are
represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will
be further mitigated.  Quarterly
fluctuations may also be affected by other factors, including the introduction
of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are
more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the
mix of sales of our finished products and changes in and/or increased
advertising, marketing and promotional expenses.

Intellectual
Property

We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our
business.  Depending upon the
jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their
registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have
become generic.  Registrations of
trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use.  We also own the copyright in and to numerous
statements made and content appearing on the packaging of our products.

We own the Hansen’s® trademark. 
This trademark is crucial to our business and is registered in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office and in various countries throughout the world. We
own a number of other trademark registrations including, but not limited to, A
New Kind a Buzz®,Unleash the Beast!®, Hansen’s Energy®, Blue Energy®,
Energade®, Hansen’s E


O Energy Water®, Hansen’s Slim Down®,
Power Formula®, The Real Deal®, Liquidfruit®, California’s Natural Choice®,
Medicine Man®, Hansen’s Power®, B·Well®, Anti-ox®, D-stress®, Stamina®,
Defense®, Immunejuice®, Hansen’s Natural Multi-Vitamin Juice Slam®, Juice
Blast®, Red Rocker®, Monster Energy®, M (stylized)®, M Monster Energy® and
Hansen’s Natural Soda®

in the United States and, the Monster®,
Monster Energy®, M(stylized)®, Hansen’s® and Smoothie® trademarks in a number
of countries around the world.

We have applied to register a number of trademarks in the United States
and elsewhere including, but not limited to, Monster™, Monster Energy™,
M(stylized)™, Assault™, Energy Pro™, Khaos™, Monster M-80™, Predator™, M
Monster Mutant™, Joker Mad Energy™, Ace™, Rumba™, Fizzit™ and Fizz Bomb™, Java
Monster™, Mean Bean™, Java Monster Big Black™, Loca Moca™ and The Juice is
Loose™.

In September 2000, in connection with the acquisition of the Blue Sky
Natural Beverage business, we acquired the Blue Sky® trademark which is
registered in the United States and Canada, through our wholly owned subsidiary
Blue Sky.

In May 2001, in connection with the acquisition of the Junior Juice
beverage business, we acquired the Junior Juice® trademark, which is registered
in the United States, through our wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice.

In October 2006,
we acquired the Unbound Energy®

trademark
which is registered in the United Sates.

On April 4, 2000, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued
a patent to us for an invention related to a shelf structure (rolling rack) and,
more particularly, a shelf structure for a walk-in cooler.  Such shelf structure is utilized by us to
secure shelf space for and to merchandise our energy and functional drinks in
cans in refrigerated Visi coolers and walk-in coolers in retail stores.


Government
Regulation

The production,
distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products is subject
to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various
environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and
regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety,
advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.  California law requires that a specific
warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the State as
having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  The law exposes all food and beverage
producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products
because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds
below which a warning is not required. 
Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose
affected products to the prospect of warning labels.  Products containing listed substances that
occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by
a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning
requirement.  While none of our beverage
products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict
whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the
California list in the future.  We also
are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would
have an impact on costs or sales of our products.

Measures have been
enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged
for certain non-refillable beverage containers. 
The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary.  Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship
proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in
Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be
proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the
United States and elsewhere.

Our facilities in
the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations.  Compliance with these
provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any
material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or
competitive position.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we employed a total of 748 employees of which
377 were employed on a full-time basis. 
Of our 748 employees, we employ 157 in administrative and operational
capacities and 591 persons in sales and marketing capacities.  We have not experienced any work stoppages
and we consider relations with our employees to be good.

Compliance
with Environmental Laws

In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our

ITEM 1A.           RISK
FACTORS

In addition to the other information in this report, you should
carefully consider the following risks. 
If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial
condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The risk factors summarized below are not the
only risks we face.  Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be
immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and/or operating results.

If we fail to maintain
effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor
confidence in our Company could be materially and adversely affected.

We are required to maintain both disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective
for the purposes described in Part II, Item 9A. If we fail to do so, our
business, results of operations or financial condition and the value of our
stock could be materially harmed.

Part II, Item 9A
reports our changes in internal control over financial reporting relating to
the documentation of stock option grants. We cannot assure that these efforts
will be successful and we may face additional risks of errors or delays in
preparing our consolidated financial statements and associated risks of
potential late filings of periodic reports and increased expenses arising from
such matters.

Legal
proceedings related to our historical stock option grant practices and other
issues may significantly harm our business.

Several
lawsuits have been filed against us and current officers and members of the
Board of Directors in connection with our prior stock option practices. These
lawsuits are described more fully in Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and in
Part II, Item 8, Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in
this Form 10-K. Defending these lawsuits will result in significant
expenditures and the continued diversion of our management’s time and attention
from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our
business operations. From time to time, we may become involved in other
litigation or other proceedings. Matters arising out of or related to our
review of historic stock option granting practices, including the outcome of
the informal inquiry commenced by the SEC, any other proceedings which may be
brought against us by the SEC or other governmental agencies, the outcome of
our delisting proceedings and the outcome of litigation could possibly harm our
future results of operations or financial condition due to expenses we may
incur to defend ourselves or the ramifications of an adverse decision.

Increased competition could hurt
our business.

The beverage industry is highly competitive.  The principal areas of competition are
pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing
campaigns.  Our products compete with a
wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers,
most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution
resources than we do.

Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and
effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and
different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing.  Our products compete with all liquid
refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed
competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally
known producers such as The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo Inc., Cadbury Schweppes
plc, Red Bull Gmbh, Kraft Foods Inc., Nestle Beverage Company, Tree Top and
Ocean Spray.  We also compete with
companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation.  Our products also compete with private label
brands such as


those carried by
grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores.  There can be no assurance that we will not
encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position
due to competition in the beverage industry. 
If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be adversely affected.

We derive a substantial portion
of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the “energy
drink” category could adversely affect our operating results.

A substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks,
including in particular our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Our DSD
segment which comprises primarily energy drinks, represented 85% of net sales
for the year ended December 31, 2006. 
Any decrease in the sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks
could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income.
Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in
the energy drink category.  Our energy
drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full Throttle, No Fear, Amp,
Adrenaline Rush, 180, Extreme Energy Shot, Red Devil, Rip It, Nos, Boo Koo and
many other brands.  A number of companies
who market and distribute iced teas and juice cocktails in different packages,
such as 16- and 20-ounce glass bottles, including Sobe, Snapple Elements,
Arizona, Fuse, and Vitamin Water, have added supplements to their products with
a view to marketing their products as “functional” or “energy” beverages or as
having functional benefits.  In addition,
certain large companies such as The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc. market
and/or distribute products in that market segment such as Mountain Dew,
Mountain Dew MDX, and Vault.  Competitive
pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues or we could
experience price erosion or lower market share, any of which could have a
material adverse affect on our business and results.

Change in consumer preferences
may reduce demand for some of our products.

There is increasing awareness and concern for the health consequences
of obesity.  This may reduce demand for
our non-diet beverages, which could affect our profitability.

Consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our
continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative
beverages.  In order to retain and expand
our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and
innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality and health,
although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no
assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the
future.  Additionally, many of our
products are considered premium products and to maintain market share during
recessionary periods we may have to reduce profit margins which would adversely
affect our results of operations. 
Product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or
packages may be limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences
change.  The beverages we currently
market are in varying stages of their lifecycles and there can be no assurance
that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us.  The
beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in
consumer preferences may adversely affect us if we misjudge such
preferences.  We may be unable to achieve
volume growth through product and packaging initiatives.  We also may be unable to penetrate new
markets.  If our revenues decline,
our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely
affected.

We rely on bottlers and other
contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to
manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business
could suffer.

We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such
manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers.

Although our production arrangements
are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request, in the event of
a disruption or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing
facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short
time period.  In addition, there are
limited packing facilities in the United States with adequate capacity


and/or
suitable equipment for many of our products, including Hansen’s® brand energy
drinks in 8.3-ounce and 16-ounce cans, our PET tea line, aseptic juice
products, juices in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles, Energade®, Monster Energy®,
Lost® Energy™, Ace™, Unbound Energy®, Rumba

TM

and Joker Mad Energy

TM

energy drinks in 8.3-, 15.5-, 16-, and
24-ounce cans, Java Monster

TM

coffee drinks in 16-ounce cans and other
products.  There are also limited shrink
sleeve labeling facilities available to us in the United States with adequate
capacity for our E


O
Energy Water®.  A disruption or delay in
production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues from
such products as alternative co-packing facilities in the United States with
adequate capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially
reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all.  Consequently, a disruption in production of
such products could adversely affect our revenues.

We rely on
bottlers and distributors to distribute our DSD products.  If we are unable to secure such bottlers and
distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our
existing bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer.

We continually seek
to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with
regional bottlers or other direct store delivery distributors having
established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.  Many of our bottlers and distributors are
affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda and non-carbonated
brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic),
including energy drinks.  In many cases,
such products compete directly with our products.

The marketing
efforts of our distributors are important for our success.  If our DSD brands prove to be less attractive
to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract
additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors
do not market and promote our products above the products of our competitors,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Our
customers are material to our success. 
If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing
customers, our business could suffer.

Unilateral
decisions could be taken by our distributors, and/or convenience chains,
grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to
discontinue carrying all or any of the our products that they are carrying at
any time, which could cause our business to suffer.

Two customers accounted for approximately 19% and 12% of the Company’s
net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively. One customer
accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the Company’s net sales for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  A decision by either customer, or any other
large customer, to decrease the amount purchased from the Company or to cease
carrying the Company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition and consolidated results of operations.

We have exclusive contracts with the State of California (“State”)
Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children (“WIC”) Supplemental
Nutrition Branch (“DHS”) to supply 100% apple juice and 100% blended juice, in
64-ounce PET plastic bottles. The contracts are each for a period of three
years with a further one-year extension option to be mutually agreed between
Hansen’s and the State of California. The parties have mutually agreed to
extend the contracts until July 11, 2008. There is no certainty whether we will
be successful in securing any new future WIC contracts with the State.  If we are unsuccessful in securing new future
WIC contracts with the State, our revenues from those products could be
materially adversely affected.

Increases in cost or shortages of
raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business.

The principal raw materials used by us comprise aluminum cans, glass
bottles and PET plastic bottles as well as juices, high fructose corn syrup,
sucrose and sucralose, the costs of which are subject to


fluctuations.  Due to the consolidations that have taken
place in the glass industry over the past few years, the prices of glass
bottles continue to increase.  The prices
of PET plastic bottles and aluminum cans increased in 2006 and again in 2007.
The prices of high fructose corn syrup, sucrose and certain juice concentrates,
including apple, increased in 2006 and certain of these ingredients continued
to increase in early 2007. These increased costs, together with increased costs
primarily of energy and gas and freight resulted in increases in certain
product costs which are ongoing and are expected to continue to exert pressure
on our gross margins in 2007.  In
addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase
their charges based on certain of their own cost increases.  We are uncertain whether the prices of any of
the above or any other raw materials or ingredients will continue to rise in
the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our
customers.

In addition, some of these raw materials, such as a sucralose and
certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers.  Sucralose, which is used in many of the
Company’s products including the Company’s low-calorie products, is purchased
by us from a single manufacturer. While we believe that our 2007 sucralose
volume allocation will be sufficient to meet the demand for our products that
contain sucralose, we may need to reformulate certain of those products that
contain sucralose with alternative sweetener systems to avoid an interruption
in supply of those products, should the need arise.

We may not
correctly estimate demand for our products. 
Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise,
particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid
growth, particularly in new markets.  If
we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure
sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, PET
plastic bottles, cans, glass, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplements, certain
sweeteners, or packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on
a short-term basis.  Moreover,
industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, supplements and
sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be
experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of
our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and
financial results.  We do not use hedging
agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk.

The costs of packaging supplies
are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass
all or some of such increased costs on to our customers.

The majority of our packaging supplies contracts allow our suppliers to
alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the
costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging
supplies, such as resin for PET bottles, aluminum for cans, pulp for cartons
and/or trays.  These changes in the
prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times
that vary by product and supplier. 
Accordingly, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these
packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that
comprise these packaging supplies. We do not use derivative instruments to
manage this risk.  If the costs of these
packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our
customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We rely upon our ongoing
relationships with our key flavor suppliers. 
If we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key
suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business.

Generally, flavor suppliers
hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. 
Consequently, we do not have the list of ingredients or formulae for our
flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be
unable to obtain these flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on
short notice. Industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates,
supplements and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the
future, be experienced, which could interfere with and/or delay production of
certain of our products.  If we have to
replace a flavor supplier, we could experience temporary disruptions in our
ability to deliver products to our customers which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.


Our intellectual property rights
are critical to our success, the loss of such rights could materially adversely
affect our business.

We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our
business.  We also own the copyright in
and to portion of the content on the packaging of our products.  We regard our trademarks, copyrights, and
similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect
such property with registered and common law trademarks and copyrights,
restrictions on disclosure and other actions to prevent infringement.  Product packages, mechanical designs and
artwork are important to our success and we take action to protect against
imitation of our packaging and trade dress and to protect our trademarks and
copyrights as necessary.  However, there
can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or
misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights.  If we lose some or all of our intellectual
property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected.

Significant changes in government
regulation may hinder sales.

The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of
our products is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health
Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local
statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale,
safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. New statutes
and regulations may also be instituted in the future. If a regulatory authority
finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance
with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be
recalled and/or reformulated and/or packaging changed, thus adversely affecting
our financial condition and operations. 
California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product
that contains a component listed by the State as having been found to cause
cancer or birth defects.  While none of
our beverage products are required to display warnings under this law, we
cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be
added to the California list in the future. 
We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under
this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.

If we are unable to maintain
brand image or product quality, or if we encounter product recalls, our
business may suffer.

Our success depends on our ability to maintain and build brand image
for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. We have no
assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have
the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on consumer preferences.  Product quality issues, real or imagined, or
allegations of product contamination, even if fake or unfounded, could tarnish
the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other
products.  We may be required from time
to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or
batches.  Product recalls could adversely
affect our profitability and our brand image. 
We do not maintain recall insurance.

While we have to
date not experienced any credible product liability litigation, there is no
assurance that we will not experience such litigation in the future.  In the event we were to experience product
liability claims or a product recall, our financial condition and business
operations could be materially adversely effected.

If we do not maintain sufficient
inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers
in sufficient quantities, or if our retailer’s inventory levels are too high,
our operating results will be adversely affected.

If we do not accurately
anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take
to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our
results of operations


may be negatively
impacted.  If we fail to meet our shipping
schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or
retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be
delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis,
we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products.  If the inventory of our products held by our
distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for
additional products, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and
adversely affect our operating results.

If we are not able to retain the
full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our
operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable
replacements.

Our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our
senior management.  We do not maintain
key person life insurance for any members of our senior management.  We currently have employment agreements with
Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg which end on December 31, 2008.  The loss of services of either of these
persons or any other key members of our senior management could adversely
affect our business until suitable replacements can be found.  There may be a limited number of personnel
with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to
locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.

Weather could adversely affect
our supply chain and demand for our products.

With regard to fruit juice, fruit juice concentrates and natural
flavors, the beverage industry is subject to variability of weather conditions,
which may result in higher prices and/or the nonavailability of any of such
items.  Sales of our products may also be
influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate,
particularly in areas outside of California. 
Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our
beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Potential changes in accounting
practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results.

We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting
standards or practices may have on our financial results.  New accounting standards could be issued that
could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.  These changes in accounting standards could
adversely affect our reported earnings. 
Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after tax
income.   Equally, increases in indirect
taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage
containers) could affect our products’ affordability and reduce our sales.

Volatility of stock price may
restrict sale opportunities.

Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including
stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products
by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates
and projections by the investment community and public comments by other
persons and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  We may be unable to achieve analysts’
earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many
product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than
others.  There can be no assurance that
the Company will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales. As a
result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders
may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices.

Provisions in our organizational
documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such
changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.

Our organizational documents may limit changes in control.  Furthermore, on May 16, 2007, Mr. Sacks and
Mr. Schlosberg together may be deemed to control a maximum of 21.8% of our
outstanding common stock.  Consequently,
Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg could exercise significant control on matters
submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending
organizational documents and approving extraordinary transactions such as a
takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common
stockholders.


Our cash flow may not be
sufficient to fund our long term goals.

We may be unable
to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and
general operating activities.  In
addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the
activities of our creditors could affect the financing of our future growth.

Litigation or legal proceedings
could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our
financial results.

We are a party,
from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, which
could adversely affect our financial results.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Our corporate offices and main warehouse are currently located at 1010
Railroad Street, Corona, California 92882. Our lease for this facility expires
in October 2010.  The area of the
facility is approximately 141,000 square feet. 
Additionally, in January 2004 we entered into a lease for additional
warehouse space in Corona, California. 
The area of this facility is approximately 80,000 square feet.  This lease will expire at the end of March
2008 with an option to extend the lease until October 2010. This facility was
subsequently sublet on April 1, 2007.  In
June 2006, the Company leased additional warehouse and office space in Corona, California
for a one year period.

In October 2006, we entered into a lease agreement
pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution
space located in Corona, California. 
This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120
months commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options.  The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at
the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the
end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution space will
replace our existing warehouse and distribution space located in Corona,
California. We plan to sublet our existing office, warehouse and distribution
space for the remainder of the lease term, unless we are able to find a tenant
acceptable to the landlord and the landlord agrees to the early termination of
the lease.

In October 2006, we also entered into an agreement to
acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, located
adjacent to the new leased warehouse and distribution space located in Corona,
California for the purpose of constructing a new office building which will
replace the Company’s existing office space in Corona, California.  In the interim, we have leased additional
office space located near our existing corporate offices.

We also rent additional warehouse space on a short-term basis from time
to time in public warehouses situated throughout the United States and Canada.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Litigation -

In June 2006, HBC filed a lawsuit against
Rockstar, Inc., Rockstar Beverage Corporation and Rockstar Brewing Company,
Inc., all Nevada corporations (collectively “Rockstar”), for false designation
of origin, trademark infringement, unfair competition, deceptive trade
practices and unfair competition, seeking an injunction and damages based on
Rockstar’s unauthorized use of HBC’s valuable and distinctive Monster
Energy®  trade dress in connection with
its alcoholic energy beverage


known
as “Rockstar 21.”  HBC alleges that the
overall appearance of Rockstar’s “Rockstar 21” beverage container is
confusingly similar to the appearance of HBC’s Monster Energy® beverages.  Further, HBC alleges that Rockstar is
infringing on other trademarks owned and used by HBC.  Rockstar has denied HBC’s allegations and
filed counterclaims against HBC based on allegations that HBC has removed and
destroyed Rockstar point-of-sale advertisements from retail stores. 
Hansen believes Rockstar’s counterclaims are without merit and intends to
diligently defend against those counterclaims. 
In September 2006, the court dismissed HBC’s claims on summary judgment
and Rockstar’s counterclaims were withdrawn without prejudice.  Hansen has appealed the court’s decision
which is currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit.

In August 2006, HBC filed a lawsuit against National Beverage Company,
Shasta Beverages, Inc., Newbevco Inc. and Freek’N Beverage Corp. (collectively “National”)
seeking an injunction and damages for trademark infringement, trademark
dilution, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices based on National’s
unauthorized use of HBC’s valuable and distinctive Monster Energy® trade dress
in connection with a line of energy drinks it launched under the “Freek” brand
name. On October 5, 2006 the United States District Court for the Central
District of California issued a preliminary injunction enjoining National from
manufacturing, distributing, shipping, marketing, selling or offering to sell
Freek energy drinks in containers that are the same or similar to the current
containers or any containers confusingly similar to HBC’s current Monster
Energy® trade dress.  National has
appealed the decision of the United States District Court for the Central
District of California to grant the preliminary injunction and this appeal is
currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.  National has filed a counter
claim against HBC for injunctive relief preventing HBC and its agents from
continuing to destroy “Freek” point of sale materials, disparaging “Freek”
products and intentionally interfering with National’s economic and business
relationships.  Based on the allegations
contained in the National counter claims, the Company believes the National
claims are without merit. The trial in the above complaint for HBC’s claims for
a permanent injunction, damages and costs, and with respect to National’s
counter claims, is scheduled to begin on August 7, 2007.  The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
predicted with certainty.

In August 2006, HBC filed an action in the Federal Courts of Australia,
Victoria District Registry against Bickfords Australia (Pty) Limited and Meak
(Pty) Ltd. (collectively “Bickfords”), in which HBC is seeking an injunction
restraining Bickfords from selling or offering for sale or promoting for sale
in Australia any energy drink or beverage under the Monster Energy or Monster
marks or any similar marks and for damages and costs.  The hearing took place in February 2007 and
was adjourned for argument to be presented to the court in June 2007.

In September 2006,
Christopher Chavez purporting to act on behalf of himself and a class of
consumers yet to be defined filed an action in the United States District
Court, Northern District of California, against the company and its
subsidiaries for unfair business practices, false advertising, violation of
California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation
alleging that the company misleadingly labels its Blue Sky beverages as
originating in and/or being canned under the authority of a company located in
Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The company has
been advised by counsel that it has valid defenses to Chavez’s class action
lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend the action.

The Company is subject to litigation from time to time in the normal
course of business.  Although it is not
possible to predict the outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to
the Company and after consultation with counsel, management believes that such
litigation in the aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Derivative Litigation

- From November 2006 through January 2007,
purported derivative lawsuits relating to the Company’s past stock option grants
were filed by parties identifying themselves as shareholders of Hansen.  These lawsuits name as defendants certain of
Hansen’s current and former employees, officers and directors, and name Hansen
as a nominal defendant.  Three of these
cases, Chandler v. Sacks, et al. (No. RIC460186), Plotkin v. Sacks, et
al. (No. RIC460485), and Alama v. Sacks, et al. (No. RIC463968), were
filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside (the “State


Derivative
Actions”).  Two additional shareholder derivative
lawsuits, Linan v. Sacks, et al. (No. ED CV 06-01393) and Cribbs v. Blower
et al. (No. ED CV 07-00037), were filed in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California.  On
March 26, 2007, the Cribbs and Linan actions were consolidated for all purposes
before the District Court, which appointed lead and local counsel and restyled
the action as In re Hansen Natural Corporation Derivative Litigation (No. ED CV
07-37 JFW (PLAx)) (the “Federal Derivative Action”).

Plaintiffs in both the State Derivative Actions and the Federal
Derivative Action, who purport to bring suit on behalf of the Company, have
made no demand on the Board of Directors and allege that such demand is
excused.  The complaints in the
derivative actions allege, among other things, that by improperly dating
certain Hansen stock option grants, defendants breached their fiduciary duties,
wasted corporate assets, unjustly enriched themselves and violated federal and
California statutes.  Plaintiffs seek,
among other things, unspecified damages to be paid to Hansen, corporate
governance reforms, an accounting, rescission, restitution and the creation of
a constructive trust.

On April 4, 2007, the plaintiff in the Chandler action applied for a
temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, seeking, inter alia,
to restrain an April 20, 2007 shareholders meeting, to impose restrictions on
the defendants’ ability to issue or exercise stock options or to transfer the
proceeds of stock option grants, and to compel discovery.  On April 6, 2007, the Superior Court of
California denied plaintiff’s application for a temporary restraining order in
its entirety.  On April 24, 2007, the
plaintiff in the Chandler action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction
again seeking, inter alia, to impose restrictions on the defendants’ ability to
issue or exercise stock options or to transfer the proceeds of stock option
grants, and to compel discovery. On April 24, 2007, defendants filed a motion
to consolidate the State Derivative Actions as well as a motion seeking to stay
the State Derivative Actions.  By
stipulation that was so ordered by the Court on May 25, 2007, the parties
agreed to resolve the April 24, 2007 motions as follows: (i) the Chandler and
Plotkin actions are now consolidated; (ii) the consolidated State Derivative
Actions are stayed for all purposes until February 29, 2008; and (iii) the
motion for a preliminary injunction has been withdrawn and may not be refiled
while the stay is pending.

On April 16, 2007, the Alama v. Sacks lawsuit filed in California
Superior Court was voluntarily dismissed. 
On May 23, 2007, Alama filed a substantially similar complaint in the
Chancery Court of Delaware, New Castle County (No. 2978).

On April 11, 2007, plaintiffs in the Federal Derivative Action filed an
application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction
seeking to prevent an April 20, 2007, shareholders meeting and alleged
violation of federal laws relating to proxy statements.  On April 16, 2007, the District Court denied
plaintiffs’ application for a temporary restraining order and sua sponte
ordered plaintiffs to show cause why sanctions should not be issued against
plaintiffs’ law firm for the filing of a frivolous motion. On May 30, 2007, the
District Court, while noting that it still found that plaintiffs’ application
for a temporary restraining order “bordered on the frivolous,” declined to
impose sanctions against plaintiffs’ law firm. On April 23, 2007, the Federal
Derivative Action plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint. The
Company must answer or otherwise respond to the complaint by June 11, 2007.

Based on the allegations contained in the complaints, the Company
believes that Plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, and the Company intends to
vigorously defend against the lawsuits. 
However, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with
certainty.

Securities Litigation

- From November 2006 through December 2006,
several plaintiffs filed shareholder class actions in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California against Hansen and
certain of its employees, officers and directors, entitled Hutton v. Hansen
Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-07599), Kingery v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al.
(No. 06-07771), Williams v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No.
06-01369), Ziolkowski v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. ED 06-01403), Walker
v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-08229) (the “Class Actions”).  On February 27, 2007, the Class Actions were
consolidated by the District Court and styled as In re Hansen Natural
Corporation Securities Litigation (CV06-07599 JFW (PLAx)).  The Court appointed Jason E. Peltier
as lead plaintiff


(“Lead
Plaintiff”) and approved lead counsel. 
Lead Plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint on April 30,
2007.  The consolidated class action
complaint supersedes all previously filed class action complaints and is the
operative complaint to which the Company must respond. The Company must answer
or otherwise respond to the complaint by June 25, 2007.  Lead Plaintiff alleges, on behalf of all
persons who purchased Hansen common stock during the period beginning November
12, 2001 through November 9, 2006 (the “Class Period”), that Hansen and the
individual defendants made misleading statements and omissions of material fact
which artificially inflated the market price of Hansen common stock throughout
the Class Period.  Plaintiffs further
allege that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by misrepresenting
or failing to disclose that defendants incorrectly dated stock option grants,
that the Company’s internal controls were inadequate, and that, as a result,
defendants engaged in improper accounting practices.  Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of
damages.

Based on the allegations contained in the amended consolidated
complaint, the Company believes that Plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, and
the Company intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.  However, the ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be predicted with certainty.

SEC Inquiry

- On October 26, 2006, the Company received
a letter from the Staff of the Pacific Regional Office of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) requesting that the Company voluntarily produce
certain documents and information relating to the Company’s filing of SEC Forms
4 and the Company’s stock option grant practices from January 1, 1996 to the
present.   The SEC subsequently agreed,
in the absence of any further requests, to limit the voluntary production of
certain documents and information from January 1, 2001 to the present.  The Company has cooperated with the SEC and
believes it has completed its production of the documents and information
requested in the October 26, 2006 letter.

Except as described above, there are no material pending legal
proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or to which any
of our properties is subject, other than ordinary and routine litigation
incidental to our business.

Gross sales, although used
internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not
be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principals in the United States of America (“GAAP”),
and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place
of net sales.  Additionally, gross sales
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as
gross sales has been defined by the Company’s internal reporting
requirements.  However, gross sales is
used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance
of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and
overall Company performance.  The use of
gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any
promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes
the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of the
Company’s operating performance.  Gross
sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments
and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers (See “Part
II, Item 7 - Results of Operations”).

Review of Historic Stock Option
Granting Practices

On October 26, 2006, we
received a letter from the Staff of the Pacific Regional Office of the SEC
requesting that we voluntarily produce certain documents and information
relating to the filing of SEC Forms 4 and our stock option granting practices
from January 1, 1996 to the present.  The
SEC subsequently agreed, in the absence of any further requests, to limit the
voluntary production of certain documents and information from January 1, 2001
to the present.  We have cooperated with
the SEC and believe that we have completed our production of the documents and
information requested in the October 26, 2006 letter.

In November 2006, we
appointed a special committee of the Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”)
to undertake an independent investigation relating to our stock option grants
and our stock option granting practices. The Special Committee retained
independent counsel and accounting advisors to assist in conducting the
investigation.  The Special Committee
reviewed all stock option grants from January 1, 2001 through November 13,
2006.  In the course of its
investigation, the Special Committee reviewed over one million documents and
emails and extensively interviewed numerous officers and directors, as well as
certain other personnel.

The Special Committee has
completed its independent investigation and found no willful or intentional
misconduct in connection with the granting or dating of, or accounting for,
stock options. The Special Committee also found that the late filing of certain
Form 4 reports, as identified in a report issued


last year by Glass Lewis
& Co., did not indicate that option grants had been backdated. The Special
Committee found no evidence raising concerns with the integrity of management
and found that management and other company personnel interviewed in the course
of the investigation were cooperative and credible.

Based on the Special Committee’s review of all stock option grants and
our evaluation of applicable accounting rules, management concluded that the
terms with respect to 10 new hire grants and two merit grants, had not been
determined with finality as at the grant date, resulting in a decision to
change the measurement dates for such grants. 
Additionally, seven grants were identified where the stock option
agreements mistakenly reflected the exercise price at either the closing price
of our common stock on the date prior to the grant date or the opening price of
our common stock on the grant date instead of the closing price on the grant
date, resulting in minor pricing errors. The pre-tax compensation expense
resulting from the above-described accounting errors is approximately $0.1
million, which should have been recorded within operating expenses over the
period from January 1, 2001 through the second quarter ended June 30, 2006.

Additionally, we identified one grant where there was an error in the
application of APB No. 25 related to a grant modification given to a
non-executive employee in fiscal 2001 and a separate error in the application
of SFAS No. 123(R), related to the cancellation of a grant to a non-executive
employee in 2006.  The pre-tax
compensation adjustment for these two grants is approximately $1.0 million
which should have been recorded within operating expenses over the period
January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2006.

As a result of the issues
discussed above regarding our past stock option practices, certain of our
option grants that were previously characterized as Incentive Stock Options in
accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 422 (“ISO’s”) will be considered
to be non-qualified stock options.

The unintentional accounting errors arising from the items discussed
above caused non-cash compensation expense together with related employment tax
expenses to be understated by a cumulative amount of $1.3 million ($1.0 million
net of income tax) over the period January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2006. We
have concluded that the impact of these errors is not material to our
historical consolidated financial statements for any previously reported
period. A correcting entry to record the cumulative impact of these errors was
recorded during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The Company also does
not consider the adjustment to be material to the fiscal year ended December
31, 2006. The adjustments increased other operating expenses by $1.3 million
and reduced provision for income taxes by $0.3 million, which resulted in a
$1.0 million reduction in net income. The adjustment also had the effect of
increasing non-current deferred tax assets by $0.05 million and reducing
additional paid-in capital by $0.2 million at December 31, 2006.

The Special Committee also
found that during the time period covered by its review, internal accounting
controls relating to our stock option granting process were inadequate,
specifically control deficiencies related to the process of documenting the
approval of stock option grants and the financial accounting in connection with
certain option grants.

In the summer of 2006, our internal audit
department performed an analysis of certain aspects of our process for granting
stock options. During that time, management implemented improvements relating
to the documentation of stock option grants. These improvements included
contemporaneous documentation of the approval of stock option grants and
contemporaneous preparation of stock option agreements for the grants approved.
Such practices were implemented during the quarter ended September 30, 2006.
Additionally, beginning the second quarter of 2006, the accounting department
implemented new procedures to review and verify the accuracy of grant prices.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
also implemented additional procedures for the communication and recording of
modifications and cancellations of stock option grants.


Effective January 1, 2007,
we implemented new written procedures regarding the granting of stock options.
Under these new procedures, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors (“Compensation Committee”) has sole and exclusive authority to grant
stock option awards to all employees who are not new hires and to all new hires
who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee
and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors (“Executive Committee”)
each independently has the authority to grant awards to new hires who are not
Section 16 employees. Awards granted by the Executive Committee are not subject
to approval or ratification by the Board or the Compensation Committee. For
purposes of these procedures, a new hire means: (i) an employee who is
commencing employment with the Company or its subsidiaries; or (ii) an employee
who is receiving a promotion to a new position with the Company or one of its
subsidiaries. The grant date of any award to a new hire shall be the first day
that The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) is open in the calendar month following
the employee’s commencement of employment or the date of the employee’s
promotion (as the case may be).  Other
than awards to new hires, awards may only be granted at a single meeting held
during the last two weeks of May and November of each year. The grant date of
any award granted at a May or November meeting shall be the first day that
Nasdaq is open in June following such May meeting, or December following such
November meeting (as the case may be). The new procedures also require certain same
day documentation. The Special Committee found that the above described
procedures constitute “best practices.” The Compensation Committee will review
and approve stock option awards to our named executive officers (“NEOs”) based
upon a review of competitive compensation data, its assessment of individual
performance, a review of each executive’s long term incentives and retention
considerations.

Nasdaq
Proceedings

On November 15, 2006, we received a Nasdaq Staff Determination letter
from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2006, we were not in compliance with the filing
requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14),
and that our securities are, therefore, subject to delisting from the Nasdaq
Capital Market. We made a request for a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel (the “Panel”).

On January 4, 2007, we notified Nasdaq of our inadvertent issuance of
an out-of-plan stock option to purchase 12,000 shares of our common stock (pre
stock splits) to an outside director on November 5, 2004, approximately four
months after the period for granting options under the Company’s Stock Option
Plan for Outside Directors (the “1994 Plan”) had expired, in apparent violation
of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(1)(A). 
On January 10, 2007, we received another Nasdaq Staff Determination
letter stating that because we had not yet regained compliance with Nasdaq
Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(1)(A), such violation served as an additional basis
for delisting the Company’s securities from the Nasdaq Capital Market.

The Panel hearing was held on January 25, 2007.  The Panel granted our request for continued
listing of our securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Our continued listing is
subject to certain conditions, including: (1) on or about March 26, 2007, we
were required to submit to Nasdaq a copy of our final investigatory report or were
required to respond to Nasdaq questions regarding the Special Committee’s
investigation of option grants; (2) on or before May 1, 2007, we were required
to inform the Panel that we had obtained stockholder approval for the granting
of the out-of-plan option grant, or had unwound the option grant; and (3) on or
before May 14, 2007, we were required to file our Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2006.

On March 5, 2007, we received an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination
letter from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, we are not in compliance with the
filing requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule
4310(c)(14), and that this filing delinquency serves as an additional basis for
delisting us from Nasdaq.

On May 16, 2007, we received an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination
letter from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended March 31, 2007, we are not in compliance with the filing
requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14),
and that this filing delinquency serves as an additional basis for delisting us
from Nasdaq.


We have met conditions (1), (2) and (3) of the Panel’s decision
relating to our request for continued listing of our securities on the Nasdaq
Capital Market.  We are still required to
file our Form 10-Q for the three-months ended March 31, 2007 to achieve
compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq
Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). By filing this Form 10-K, the Company has
complied with the Panel’s deadline of June 14, 2007 for the filing of the Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The Company anticipates
filing the Form 10-Q for the three-months ended March 31, 2007 as soon as
practicable and within the time period required by Nasdaq to continue to be
listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

As
a result of the late filing of the 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2006, the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and the 10-Q
for the three-months ended March 31, 2007 we will be ineligible to register our
securities on Form S-3 for sale by us or resale by others for one
year.  The inability to use Form S-3 could
adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period. However, we
are still eligible to register our securities on Form S-1.  If we fail to timely file a future periodic
report with the SEC and our stock were delisted, it could severely impact our
ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse impact on our overall
future liquidity.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Our
Business

Overview

We develop,
market, sell and distribute “alternative” beverage category natural sodas,
fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit
juice smoothies and “functional drinks,” non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced
teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, children’s multi-vitamin juice drinks, Junior
Juice® juices and non-carbonated lightly flavored energy waters under the
Hansen’s® brand name.  We also develop,
market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names;
Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy™, Joker Mad Energy™, Unbound Energy® and Ace™
brand names as well as Rumba™ brand energy juice.  We also market, sell and distribute Java
Monster™ non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. We also market, sell and
distribute natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic
natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue
Sky® brand name. Our fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under the Junior
Juice® brand name.  We also market, sell
and distribute vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the
Fizzit™ brand name.

We have two
reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy
drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda
beverages.  The DSD segment develops,
markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network,
whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily
direct to retailers.

Our sales and
marketing strategy for all our beverages and drink mixes is to focus our
efforts on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores
and at events.  We use our branded
vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we sample our products
to consumers.  We utilize “push-pull”
methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets
and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising,
in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and
racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from
selected public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship
of selected causes such as cancer research and SPCAs, as well as extreme sports
teams such as the Pro Circuit – Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams,
Kawasaki Factory Motocross and Supercross


teams,
Alan Pflueger Desert Racing Team, Kenny Bernstein Drag Racing Team, extreme
sports figures and athletes, sporting events such as the Monster Energy® Pro
Pipeline surfing competition, Winter and Summer X-Games, marathons, 10k runs,
bicycle races, volleyball tournaments and other health and sports related activities,
including extreme sports, particularly supercross, freestyle motocross,
surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, BMX, mountain
biking, snowmobile racing, etc., and we also participate in product
demonstrations, food tasting and other related events.  Posters, print, radio and television
advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to
promote our brands.

We believe that
one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, such as
making Hansen’s® products visually distinctive from other beverages on the
shelves of retailers.  We review our
products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to
make them different, better and unique. 
The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from
time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may
be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to
time.

During 2006, we
continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our
markets.  In particular, we continued to
focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category
generally described as the “alternative” beverage category, with particular
emphasis on energy type drinks.

During the second
quarter of 2006, we entered into the Monster Beverages Off-Premise Distribution
Coordination Agreement and the Allied Products Distribution Coordination
Agreement (jointly, the “Off-Premise Agreements”) with Anheuser-Busch, Inc., a
Missouri corporation (“AB”).  Under the
Off-Premise Agreements, select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the “AB
Distributors”) will distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s
Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, Rumba™
brand energy juice and Unbound Energy® 
brand energy drinks, as well as additional products that may be agreed
between the parties.  We intend to
continue building our national distributor network primarily with select AB
distributors as well as with our sales force throughout 2007 to support and grow
the sales of our products.

Pursuant to the
Anheuser-Busch Distribution Agreements (the “AB Distribution Agreements”)
entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors, non-refundable payments
totaling $20.9 million were made to the Company by such newly appointed AB
Distributors for the costs of terminating the Company’s prior distributors
through December 31, 2006. Such receipts have been accounted for as deferred
revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006
and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of
the respective AB Distribution Agreements.

As of December 31, 2006,
amounts totaling $3.3 million had been paid to the Company by certain other AB
Distributors in anticipation of executing AB Distribution Agreements with the
Company. Such receipts have been accounted for as customer deposit liabilities
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006.

Through December 31, 2006,
the Company incurred termination costs amounting to $12.7 million in aggregate
to certain of its prior distributors. Such termination costs have been expensed
in full and are included in operating expenses for the year ended December 31,
2006. Certain amounts totaling $7.0 million included in such termination costs
were not paid to our prior distributors before our fiscal year end and are
therefore included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2006.

On April 28, 2006,
HBC entered into a distribution agreement with Cadbury Bebidas, S.A. de C.V. (“Cadbury
Bebidas”), for exclusive distribution by Cadbury Bebidas throughout Mexico,
excluding Baja California, of our Monster Energy® and

Lost® Energy™ energy products.


On February 8,
2007, HBC entered into the On-Premise Distribution Coordination Agreement (the “On-Premise
Agreement”) with AB.  Under the
On-Premise Agreement, AB will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution and
merchandising of Monster Energy® energy drinks to on-premise retailers
including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by HBC.

On March 1, 2007, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with
Pepsi-QTG Canada, a division of PepsiCo Canada, ULC (“Pepsi Canada”), for the
exclusive distribution by Pepsi Canada throughout Canada of our

Monster
Energy®,

Lost® Energy™,
Hansen’s® and Joker Mad Energy™
energy products.

We again achieved
record gross sales in 2006.  The increase
in gross sales in 2006 was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of
certain of our existing products as well as certain new products, particularly
Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks, Ace

TM

energy

drinks and Unbound Energy® drinks.  The percentage increase in gross sales was
lower than the percentage increase in net sales, primarily due to a decrease in
promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which
decreased from 16.0% to 13.0%.  The
actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased to $90.5 million
from $66.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
respectively.

A
substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks.  Any decrease in
sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks could significantly adversely
affect our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the “energy
drink” category could adversely affect our operating results. (See “Part I,
Item 1A. - Risk Factors”)

During the year
ended December 31, 2006, gross sales shipped outside of California represented
67.8% of our gross sales, as compared to 61.5% for the comparable period in
2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, gross sales to distributors
outside the United States amounted to $19.3 million, as compared to $5.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2005. 
Such sales were approximately 2.8% of gross sales for the year ended
December 31, 2006 and approximately 1.3% of gross sales for the comparable
period in 2005.

Our customers are
typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug
chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage
distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales
to our various customer types for 2006 are reflected below.  The allocations below reflect changes made by
the Company to the categories historically reported.

Bottling/7UP Bottling Group), Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), Kalil
Bottling Group, Trader Joe’s, John Lenore & Company, Costco, Kroger,
Safeway and Albertsons.  A decision by
any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to cease
carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial
condition and consolidated results of operations.  Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group, a customer
of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 19%, 18% and 13% of our net
sales for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse
divisions, accounted for approximately 12% of the Company’s net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2006.


In September 2000, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Blue Sky,
acquired the Blue Sky® Natural Soda business. 
The Blue Sky® natural soda brand is the leading natural soda in the
health food trade.  Blue Sky offers
natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and
anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a
Blue Sky® Blue Energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans and in 2004 introduced a new line
of Blue Sky® natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans. In 2005, we introduced a new
line of Blue Sky® lite natural sodas, a new line of Blue Sky® natural sodas
made with real sugar and a new line of non-carbonated Blue Sky® isotonic sports
drinks. In 2006, we introduced our Blue Sky® Blue Energy drinks in 16-ounce
cans and introduced a new Blue Sky® 
juice based energy drink in both 8-ounce and 16-ounce cans.

In May 2001, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice,
acquired the Junior Juice® beverage business. 
The Junior Juice® product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices
packed in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers.

In October 2006, we acquired
the Unbound Energy® trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of

Unbound Energy

®

energy drinks
in 16-ounce cans. We subsequently introduced a lo-carb and juice version in
16-ounce cans.

During 2004, we concluded exclusive contracts with the State of California,
Department of Health Services Women, Infant and Children Supplemental Nutrition
Branch, to supply 100% Apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce PET
plastic bottles. The contracts commenced on July 12, 2004 and will expire in
July 2008.  (See “Part I, Item 1.
Business – Manufacture and Distribution”).

We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development
and introduction of new products and flavors.

Value Drivers of our Business

We believe that the key
value drivers of our business include the following:

·

Profitable Growth

– We believe natural, better for you
brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad
consumer base, drive profitable growth. 
We continue to broaden our family of brands.  In particular, we are expanding and growing
our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to
consumers.  We are focused on maintaining
or increasing profit margins. We believe that tailored brand, package, price
and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth.  We are implementing these strategies with a
view to accelerating profitable growth.

·

Cost Management

– The principal focus of cost management
will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction.  One key area of focus, for example, is to
decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative
costs as a percentage of net operating revenues.  Another key area of focus is the reduction in
inventory levels.  However, due to the
expansion in the number of our products, increased sales levels in 2006, and
the conclusion of the agreements with AB, overall inventory levels
increased.  During 2006, the costs of PET
plastic bottles and aluminum cans, as well as the costs of high fructose corn
syrup, sucrose, certain juice concentrates, including apple, and certain
packaging and freight costs also increased.

·

Efficient Capital Structure

– Our capital structure is intended to
optimize our costs of capital.  We
believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at
low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive
advantage.


We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw
materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will
result in (1) maintaining and/or improving our gross profit margin; (2)
providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a
percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of
capital.  The ultimate measure of success
is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.

Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income
and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value
drivers.  In 2006, gross sales totaled
$696.3 million, a 67.6% increase over 2005. 
Net sales totaled $605.8 million in 2006, an increase of 73.6% over 2005.  Gross profit totaled $316.6 million in 2006,
a 73.4% increase from 2005.  Operating
income was $158.6 million compared to $103.4 million for 2005.  Net income was $97.9 million as compared to
$62.8 million for 2005.  Net income per
diluted share was $0.99 as compared to net income per diluted share of $0.65 in
2005.  These measurements will continue
to be a key management focus in 2007 and beyond.

See also “Results of Operations for
the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31,
2005.”

In 2006, the Company had working capital of $212.3 million compared to
$107.3 million as of December 31, 2005. 
In 2006, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately
$76.4 million as compared to $54.6 million in 2005.  Principal uses of cash flows are purchases of
inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of
property and equipment and trademarks. 
Payment of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be
and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (See
also “Part II, Item 7. - Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Looking
forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand
the attention of the beverage industry and our Company.  Increase in consumer and regulatory awareness
of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents
a challenge.  We recognize that obesity
is a complex and serious public health problem. 
Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a
wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks,
sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. 
We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage
innovation, choice and variety.

Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of
different and innovative beverages.  Our
future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and
introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no
assurance of our ability to do so.  In
order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and
introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of
quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property
protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences
and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge
such preferences.

In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our
company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to:

·

maintenance of our brand images and
product quality;

·

profitable expansion and growth of our
family of brands in the competitive market place (See also “Part I, Item 1.
- -  Business - Competition and Sales and
Marketing”);

·

restrictions on imports and sources of
supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations;


·

protection of our existing intellectual
property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and
innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines;

·

limitations on available quantities of
sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage
products, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier’s production
capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package
containers such as the 24-ounce cap can and copacking availability;

·

the imposition of additional
restrictions; and

·

(See also “Part I, Item 1A. - Risk
Factors”) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our
Company.

We believe that the
following opportunities exist for us:

·

growth potential for non-alcoholic
beverage categories including energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and
juice drinks, sports drinks and water;

·

new product introductions intended to
contribute to higher gross profits;

·

premium packages intended to generate
strong revenue growth;

·

significant package, pricing and channel
opportunities to maximize profitable growth;

·

proper positioning to capture industry
growth; and

·

broadening distribution/expansion
opportunities

Gross sales, although used
internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not
be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance
with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating
performance in place of net sales. 
Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our
internal reporting requirements. 
However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating
performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson
performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance.  The use of gross sales allows evaluation of
sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask
certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales
allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance.  Gross sales may not be realized in the form
of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from
payments received from customers.

**

Although the expenditures
described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet
GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP
presentation requirements.  Additionally,
the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to
similar items presented by other companies. 
The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an
evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and
illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and
other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities.


Results
of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended
December 31, 2005

Segment Reclassification.

Rumba

TM

brand energy juice, which was previously
reported in the Warehouse segment, is now reported in the DSD segment.  Similarly, Hansen’s® energy drinks, which
were previously reported in the DSD segment, are now reported in the Warehouse
segment.  For presentation purposes,
these changes are assumed to have commenced January 1, 2006 and are reflected
as such in the figures for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The comparable figures for such products for
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as previously
reported, have been recast to reflect the above reclassification.

Gross Sales.*

Gross sales were
$696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of
approximately $280.9 million or 67.6% higher than the $415.4 million gross
sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. 
The increase in gross sales for 2006 was primarily attributable to
increased sales volumes of certain of our existing products, including the full
year sales of Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks which were introduced in August
2005. Promotional and other allowances were $90.5 million for 2006 an increase
of 24.0 million or 36.1% higher than promotional and other allowances of $66.5
million for 2005. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross
sales decreased from 16.0% in 2005 to 13.0% in 2006.  As a result the percentage increase in gross
sales in 2006 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales.

*Gross
sales – see definition above.

Net Sales

. Net sales were $605.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately
$256.9 million or 73.6% higher than net sales of $348.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005.  The increase in
net sales was primarily attributable to

increased
sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, which include
Monster Energy® drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy®
drinks (introduced in 2003), Monster Energy® Assault

TM

energy drinks (introduced in September 2004),
as well as sales of Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks
(introduced in August 2005). To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was
attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice
cocktails, Lost® Energy™ drinks (introduced in January 2004), sports drinks,
Rumba™ brand energy juice (introduced December 2004), Junior Juice®, Ace™
energy drinks (introduced in August 2006) and Unbound Energy® energy drinks.
The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume
primarily of Hansen’s® energy drinks, smoothies in cans and Energade® energy
sports drinks.

Case
sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents were 72.7 million cases for the year ended
December 31, 2006, an increase of 24.5 million cases or 50.9% higher than case
sales of 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall
average net sales price per case increased to $8.33 for 2006 or 15% higher than
the net sales price per case of $7.24 for 2005. 
The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable
to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced
products.

Net
sales for the DSD segment were $514.3 million for year ended December 31, 2006,
an increase of approximately $251.4 million or 95.6% higher than net sales of $262.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2005. 
The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to

increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand
energy drinks, which include Monster Energy® drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy®
drinks, Monster Energy® Assault

TM

energy drinks, as well as sales of Monster
Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the
increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of Lost®
Energy™ drinks, Rumba

TM

brand energy juice, Ace

TM

energy drinks and Unbound Energy® energy
drinks.  The increase in net sales was
partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Energade® energy
sports drinks.

Net
sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2006, an increase of approximately $5.5 million or 6.4% higher than net
sales of $86.0 million for the year


ended December 31,
2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to

increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice
cocktails,

Junior Juice®
and sports drinks.  The increase in net
sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen’s®
energy drinks and smoothies in cans.

Gross Profit.***

Gross profit was $316.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $134.1 million or 73.4%
higher than the gross profit of $182.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2005.  Gross profit as a percentage of
net sales was 52.3% for both 2006 and 2005. 
Increases in sales volumes contributed to an increase in gross profit
dollars.  Gross profit as a percentage of
net sales was affected by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD
segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. In addition,
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also affected by a significant
increase in certain freight-in costs due to the addition of new co-packers and
warehouses and an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including
sucrose, PET and aluminum cans and apple juice concentrate. These factors were
offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross
profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment.

***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of
other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their
distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and
instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses.

Operating Expenses

.  Total operating expenses were $158.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9
million or 99.8% higher than total operating expenses of $79.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net
sales increased to 26.1% for 2006 from 22.6% for 2005. The increase in total
operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales
was primarily attributable to increased selling and distribution, and general
and administrative expenses.

Selling
and distribution expenses were $95.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2006, an increase of approximately $44.5 million or 87.8% higher than selling
and distribution expenses of $50.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2005.  Selling and distribution expenses
as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 15.7%, which was higher than selling
and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales of 14.6% for 2005.  The increase in selling and distribution
expenses was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse
costs of $18.9 million primarily due to increased volumes of shipments and
increased freight rates and fuel prices, as well as increased expenditures of
$6.9 million for merchandise displays primarily in anticipation of the
changeover to select AB distributors, $4.3 million for sponsorships and
endorsements, $4.3 million for trade development activities with distributors
and customers, $2.7 million for commissions and royalties

,

and $1.8 million for sampling programs.

General
and administrative expenses were $62.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2006, an increase of approximately $34.4 million or 121.6% higher than general
and administrative expenses of $28.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2005. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006
were 10.4%, which was higher than general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales of 8.1% for 2005. 
The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily
attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors of
$12.7 million, stock compensation expense of $8.3 million as a result of our
adoption of SFAS 123R which was not expensed in the previous year (see Part II,
Item 8, Note 12, “Stock-Based Compensation”) including a cumulative adjustment
of $1.3 million relating to stock based compensation and related charges (see
Part II, Item 8, Note 13, “Review of Historic Stock Option Granting Practices”),
an increase in payroll expenses of $5.3 million, and an increase of $5.2 million
in professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees.  Included in legal and accounting fees are
costs of $3.8 million relating to the Company’s special investigation of stock
option grants.

Contribution Margin.

Contribution margin represents net sales by
segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly
attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the


DSD segment was
$187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately
$78.9 million or 72.4% higher than contribution margin of $109.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005.  The
increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable
to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.  Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment
was $6.1 million for 2006, a decrease of approximately $4.3 million or 41.0%
lower than contribution margin of $10.4 million for 2005.  The decrease in the contribution margin for
the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to reduced sales of Hansen’s®
energy drinks and a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of
raw materials and production.

Operating Income.

Operating income was $158.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $55.2 million or
53.4% higher than operating income of $103.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005.  The increase in
operating income was attributable to higher gross profit, which was offset by
increased selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses. Operating
income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.2% for 2006 from 29.6% for
2005.  The decrease in operating income
as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased general
and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales.

Interest Income, net

.  Net interest income was $3.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $2.3 million from net interest
income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.  The increase in net interest income was
primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on the Company’s
invested cash balances which have increased significantly over the year.

Provision for Income Taxes

.  Provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2006 was $64.3 million as compared to provision for income taxes
of $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.  The effective combined federal and state tax
rate for was 39.6%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.1% for
2005.  The decrease in the effective tax
rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities
that are exempt from federal income taxes and, certain federal tax credits
relating to export sales, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in state taxes due
to the apportionment of sales to various states outside of California which
have lower state tax rates.  This
decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive
stock options for which we received no tax benefit.

Net Income

.  Net income was $97.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $35.1 million or 56.0% higher than net
income of $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The increase in net
income was attributable to the increase in gross profit of approximately $134.1
million and the increase in net interest income of approximately $2.3 million,
which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of
approximately $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of
approximately $22.3 million.

Results of Operations for the
Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004

Segment Reclassification

.

Rumba

TM

brand energy juice, which was previously
reported in the Warehouse segment, is now reported in the DSD segment.  Similarly, Hansen’s® energy drinks, which
were previously reported in the DSD segment, are now reported in the Warehouse
segment.  For presentation purposes,
these changes are assumed to have commenced January 1, 2006 and are reflected
as such in the figures for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The comparable figures for such products for
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as previously
reported, have been restated to reflect the above reclassification.

Gross Sales.

For the year
ended December 31, 2005, gross sales were $415.4 million, an increase of $191.3
million or 85.4% higher than gross sales of $224.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.  The increase in gross
sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing
products and the introduction of new products as discussed below in “Net Sales.”  The percentage increase in gross sales was
lower than the percentage increase in net sales due to a decrease in


the promotional
and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 19.5%
for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 16.0% for the year ended December 31,
2005, although the actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased
from $43.8 million to $66.5 million for the respective periods.

*Gross sales – see
definition above

Net Sales.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, net
sales were $ 348.9 million, an increase of $168.5 million or 93.5% higher than
net sales of $180.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  We again achieved record sales in 2005. The
increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily attributable to increased
sales by volume of our Monster Energy® drinks, which were introduced in April
2002, including our lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, which were introduced in
2003, our Monster Energy® Assault

TM

energy drinks, which were introduced in
September 2004, sales of Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks, which were introduced in August
2005, increased sales by volume of Lost® Energy

TM

energy
drinks which were introduced in January 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales
of Joker Mad Energy

TM

drinks which were introduced in January 2005,
as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, and children’s
multi-vitamin juice drinks and Rumba™ which was introduced in December
2004.  The increase in gross and net
sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen’s
Natural Sodas®, Hansen’s® energy drinks, Energade® and Smoothies in cans.  Net sales case volumes (calculated on 192
U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage equivalent basis) increased from 29.8
million cases for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 48.2 million cases for
the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 18.4 million cases or
62.0%.  The overall average net sales
price per case also increased to $7.24 per case for the year ended December 31,
2005 from $6.06 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of
19.5%.  The increase in the average net
sales prices per case was due to an increase in the proportion of case sales
derived from higher priced products as described below.

Net
sales for the DSD segment were $262.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2005, an increase of approximately $163.5 million or 164.4% higher than net
sales of $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The increase in net sales for the DSD segment
was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy®
drinks, including our lo-carb Monster Energy® drinks, our Monster Energy®
Assault

TM

energy drinks, sales of Monster Energy® Khaos

TM

energy drinks, increased sales by volume of
Lost® Energy

TM

energy drinks. The increase in net sales was
also attributable, to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker Mad Energy

TM

drinks and Rumba

TM

energy juice. 
The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume
of Energade®.

Net
sales for the Warehouse segment were $86.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2005, an increase of approximately $5.1 million or 6.3% higher than net
sales of $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in
net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased
sales by volume of Hansen’s® apple juice and juice blends, children’s
multi-vitamin juice drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by
lower sales by volume of smoothies in cans, Hansen’s® energy drinks and Hansen’s
Natural Sodas®.

Gross Profit

.  Gross profit
was $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $99.1
million or 118.7% over the $83.5 million gross profit for the year ended
December 31, 2004.  Gross profit as a
percentage of net sales was 52.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005
which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 46.3% for
the year ended December 31, 2004, due primarily to higher gross profit
margins achieved on the increased sales of Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy

TM

energy
drinks.  Although a greater percentage of
our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year,
the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional
payments and allowances to promote our products.

*** Gross Profit – see definition
above


Total
Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses were $79.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2005, an increase of $29.5 million or 59.6% over total operating expenses
of $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  Total operating expenses as a percentage of
net sales decreased to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005, from 27.4%
for the year ended December 31, 2004. 
The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to
increased selling, general and administrative expenses.  The decrease in total operating expenses as a
percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively lower
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in
net sales.

Distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing
expenses after manufacture, were $22.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2005 and $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and have been
included in operating expenses.

Selling

.  Selling
expenses were $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase
of $21.5 million or 73.7% over selling expenses of $29.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004.  Selling
expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2005 from 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The increase in selling expenses was
primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses
which increased by $9.7 million, increased expenditures for trade development
activities and cooperative arrangements with our customers and distributors,
which increased by $4.2 million, increased expenditures for merchandise
displays, point-of-sale materials, and premiums, which increased by $3.0
million, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements which
increased $1.7 million, increased expenditures for advertising which increased
by $1.3 million, and increased expenditures for samples, which increased by
$1.2 million.

General and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses were
$28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $8.0
million or 39.4% over general and administrative expenses of $20.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004. 
General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales
decreased to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 11.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administrative expenses
was primarily attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.6 million,
distributor termination payments which increased by $1.2 million and travel and
entertainment expenses which increased by $0.7 million.

Amortization of Trademarks

. Amortization of trademarks was $0.07
million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $0.003 million from
amortization of trademarks of $0.073 million for the year ended December 31,
2004. The decrease in amortization of trademarks was due to a reduction in the
balance of definite life trademarks.

Contribution
Margin.

Contribution
margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating
expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales.  Contribution margin for the DSD segment was
$109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of
approximately $73.9 million or 210.5% higher than contribution margin of $35.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The increase in contribution
margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net
sales of Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and Lost® Energy

TM

energy drinks. 
Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $10.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $0.8 million or 8.3%
higher than contribution margin of $9.6 million for year ended December 31,
2004.  The increase in the contribution
margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales
of apple juice and juice blends which was offset by the reduced contribution
from lower sales of Hansen’s® energy drinks.

Operating Income.

Operating
income was $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to
$33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The $69.6 million increase in operating
income was primarily attributable to increased gross profits, which was
partially offset by increased operating expenses.


Interest Income, net

.

Net interest income was $1.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to net interest income of $52,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2004.  Net
interest income consists of interest income and interest and financing expense.
The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in
the cash balances in interest bearing accounts during the year ended December
31, 2005.  Interest income for the year
ended December 31, 2005 was $1.4 million compared to interest income of $0.09
million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 
Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2005
was $0.08 million compared to $0.04 million for the year ended December 31,
2004.  The increase in interest and
financing expense was primarily attributable to an increase in capital leases
entered into during 2005.

Provision for Income Taxes.

Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $42.0
million which was an increase of $28.4 million as compared to the provision for
income taxes of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The increase in provision for income taxes
was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income.  The effective combined federal and state tax
rate for 2005 was 40.1%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 39.9% for
2004.

Net Income.

Net income was $62.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005, which was an increase of $42.4 million as compared to net
income of $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The increase in net income was primarily
attributable to the $99.1 million increase in gross profit and an increase of
net interest income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 which
was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $29.5 million and an
increase in the provision for income taxes of $28.4 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flows provided by operating activities –

Net cash provided by operating activities was $76.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $54.6 million in the
comparable period in 2005.  For 2006,
cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income
earned of $97.9 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses
consisting of $8.3 million of share-based compensation and $1.5 million of
depreciation and other amortization. In 2006, cash provided by operations also
increased due to a $20.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $14.0 million
increase in accrued liabilities, a $7.7 million increase in accounts payable, a
$21.1 million increase in income taxes payable, a $1.0 million increase in
accrued compensation and a $3.3 million increase in customer deposit
liabilities.  In 2006, cash provided by
operating activities was reduced due to a $45.6 million increase in
inventories, a $25.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $17.3 million
increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options and a $10.9 million
increase in deferred income taxes. The increase in accounts receivable was
attributable to increased sales volumes as well as to increased sales to
certain classes of customers who have longer payment terms. The increase in
inventory is attributable to the addition of new copackers and warehouses, the
introduction of new products and planned inventory levels to meet consumer
demand.

Purchases
of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition
of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts
payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring
use of cash.

Cash flows (used in) provided by investing
activities

–

Net cash used
in investing activities was $95.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
as compared to $3.2 million provided by investing activities in the comparable
period in 2005.  For 2006, cash used in
investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short-term
investments, particularly available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
investments.  Cash provided by investing
activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash
used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets
consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support the
marketing and promotional activities of the Company, production equipment,
computer and office furniture and equipment used for sales and administrative
activities, as wells as certain leasehold improvements.  Management expects that it will continue to
use a portion of its cash in excess


of its
requirements for operations, for purchasing short-term investments and for
other corporate purposes.  Management, from
time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically
items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products,
storage racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional
equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses
compatible with the image of the Company’s brands.

Cash flows (used in) provided by
financing activities –

Net cash used in financing activities
was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to net cash
provided by financing activities of $0.1 million for the comparable period in
2005.  For 2006, cash used in financing
activities was primarily attributable to purchases of $27.7 million of the
Company’s common stock and principal payments of long-term debt of $1.2 million
in relation to lease payments made on vehicle leases entered into over the past
year.  In 2006, cash used in financing
activities was partially offset by a $17.3 million tax benefit in connection
with the exercise of certain stock options and by proceeds of $3.9 million
received from the issuance of common stock.

Debt and other obligations

–

HBC has a credit facility from Comerica Bank (“Comerica”)
consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance
with the amended provisions of the credit facility, HBC increased its available
borrowing under the revolving line of credit from $7.5 million collateralized
to $10.0 million non-collateralized.  The
revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through June 1,
2008.  Interest on borrowings under the
line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or
varying LIBOR rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to
1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by HBC. The Company
had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2006.

The terms of the Company’s line of credit contain
certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios.  The Company was in compliance with its
covenants at December 31, 2006.

If
any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or
involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of
credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to
them, including instituting legal proceedings.

Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations under our
agreement with the Las Vegas Monorail Company and other commitments.  (See also “Part II, Item 8 - Note 10,
Commitments & Contingencies”).

Purchase commitments include obligations made by the Company and its
subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing
and packaging of our products.  These
obligations vary in terms.

The following represents a summary of the Company’s contractual
obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2006:

In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply
agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”), dated
as of January 1, 2006, the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume
of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period
commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009.  Should the Company fail to purchase the
minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital
reimbursements on a pro-rated basis.  The
Company’s maximum liability under this agreement is $8.6 million, subject to
compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement.

Management believes that
cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line
of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase
commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable,
payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs,
purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital
assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on the
Company’s current plans, at this time the Company estimates that capital
expenditures are likely to be less than $10.0 million through December
2007.  However, future business
opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.

In October 2006, the
Company entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which the Company leased
346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona,
California.  This lease commitment
provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months commencing March 2007,
excluding renewal options.  The monthly
rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over
the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period.  The new warehouse and distribution space will
replace the Company’s existing warehouse and distribution space located in
Corona, California. We plan to sublet our existing office, warehouse and distribution
space for the remainder of the lease term, unless we are able to find a tenant
acceptable to the landlord and the landlord agrees to the early termination of
the lease.

In October 2006, the
Company also entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for
a purchase price of $1.4 million, located adjacent to the new leased warehouse
and distribution facility located in Corona, California for the purpose of
constructing a new office building thereon which will replace the Company’s existing
office space in Corona, California.  In
the interim, the Company has leased additional office space located near our
existing corporate offices.

Accounting
Policies and Pronouncements

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
GAAP.  GAAP requires the Company to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated
financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts
receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and
trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or
other transactions that occur in the normal course of business.  The following summarizes the most significant
accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company:

Accounts Receivable

– The Company
evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number
of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific
customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a
specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the
recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will
ultimately be collected.  In addition to
specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are
recorded based on the Company’s recent past loss history and an overall
assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.


Inventories

– Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the
current estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews
its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and
obsolete inventory based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of
product demand, production availability and/or its ability to sell the
product(s) concerned.  Demand for the
Company’s products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect
demand for the Company’s products include unanticipated changes in consumer
preferences, general market conditions or other factors that may result in
cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by
customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions.  Additionally, management’s estimates of
future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated
or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.

Long-Lived Assets

–

Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other
long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible
impairment.  This review occurs annually
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. 
If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or
amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If these cash flows are less than the
carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down
the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the
present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
management’s estimates of the business risks. 
No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2006.

Management believes that the accounting estimate
related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a “critical
accounting estimate” because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change
from period to period because it requires company management to make
assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that
recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated
balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material.  Management’s assumptions about cash flows and
discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and
expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so.

Intangibles

– Intangibles are
comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company’s exclusive
ownership of the Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale
and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster
Energy® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of
supplements and beverages.  The Company
also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States,
as well as in a number of countries around the world.  The Company also owns the Blue Sky®
trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice®
trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Under the provisions
on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived
trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25
years.

In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if
there is an indication of impairment.  If
there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not
subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the
carrying amount of the asset.  An
impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair
value if it is less than the carrying amount. 
The fair value is calculated using the income approach.  However, preparation of estimated expected
future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management’s best
estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions.  Based on management’s impairment analysis
performed for the year ended December 31, 2006, the estimated fair values of
trademarks exceeded the carrying value.


In estimating
future revenues, we use internal budgets. 
Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future
marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future
introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

– The Company recognizes revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales
price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Management believes
that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage
based on the Company’s historical experience. Amounts paid to the Company by
newly appointed AB Distributors for the costs of terminating certain of the
Company’s prior distributors are accounted for as deferred revenue which will
be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the
respective AB Distribution Agreements.

Net Sales

– Net sales have been
determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance
with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-09.

Cost of Sales

– Cost of sales
consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of our
products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as
certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the
manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control
costs.  Raw materials account for the
largest portion of the cost of sales. 
Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and
packaging materials.

Operating Expenses

– Operating expenses include selling
expenses such as distribution expenses to transport our products to our
customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for
advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise
displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses,
other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include
such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including
legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior
distributors, depreciation, and other general and administrative costs.

Stock-Based Compensation

– Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for share-based
compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair
values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to
estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. The Company’s employee stock options, however, have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For
example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions
and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards
ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the
estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that
will ultimately be realized by an employee. The Company uses historical data to
estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the
expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the
option. If actual results are not consistent with the Company’s assumptions and
judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be required
to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could
be material to its results of operations.


Income Taxes

–
Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable
for the current year.  A deferred income
tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of
temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent
and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax
assets.  If the Company determines that
it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the Company
will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby
decreasing net income.  Evaluating the
value of these assets is necessarily based on the Company’s judgment.  If the Company subsequently determines that
the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the
future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby
increasing net income in the period when that determination was made.

Newly
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Information regarding
newly issued accounting pronouncements is contained in Part II, Item 8, Note 1
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Sales

The table set forth below
discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years.  Data from any one or more quarters is not
necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.

Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case
volume.  A “unit case” means a unit of
measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce
servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished
beverage.  Unit case volume of the
Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages
directly or indirectly sold by the Company. 
Sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not
material, are expressed in actual cases.

The Company’s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends
that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the
year.  It has been our experience that
beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each
fiscal year.  Because the primary
historical market for Hansen’s products is California, which has a year-long
temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may
have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the
distribution of Hansen’s products expands outside of California. The Company’s
experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal
than traditional beverages.  As the
percentage of the Company’s sales that are represented by such products
continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated.  Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected
by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new
markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new
bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished
products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.  (See also “Part I, Item 1. - Business –
Seasonality”).

these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties.  Those factors and the other risk factors
described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could
cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed
in any of our forward-looking statements. 
Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results.
Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results
described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent
uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse
than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions
only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to
provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and
assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to
reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of
unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities
laws.

ITEM 7A.               QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISKS

In
the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a
variety of risks.  The principal market
risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and
prices) to which the Company is exposed are fluctuations in energy and fuel
prices, commodity prices affecting the costs of juice concentrates and other raw
materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the price of aluminum
for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, as well as sucrose and high fructose
corn syrup, which are used in many of the Company’s products), changes in
interest rates on the Company’s long-term debt and limited availability of
certain raw materials such as sucralose.  We are also subject to market risks with
respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased
costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which
we operate.  In addition, we are subject
to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate,
including the collectibility of accounts receivable.

At
December 31, 2006, the Company’s debt consisted of amounts owed in connection
with certain fixed-rate capital leases. 
There have been no significant changes to the Company’s exposure to
market risks.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

–

We conducted an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting,
on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

–
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company implemented new written
procedures, effective January 1, 2007, regarding the granting of stock options.
Under these new procedures, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has sole and exclusive authority to
grant stock option awards to all employees who are not new hires and to all new
hires who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  The Compensation Committee and the Executive
Committee of the Board each independently has the authority to grant awards to
new hires who are not Section 16 employees. Awards granted by the Executive
Committee are not subject to approval or ratification by the Board or the
Compensation Committee. For purposes of these procedures, a new hire means: (i)
an employee who is commencing employment with the Company or its subsidiaries;
or (ii) an employee who is receiving a promotion to a new position with the
Company or one of its subsidiaries. The grant date of any award to a new hire
shall be the first day that Nasdaq is open in the calendar month following the
employee’s commencement of employment or the date of the employee’s promotion
(as the case may be). Other than awards to new hires, awards may only be
granted at a single meeting held during the last two weeks of May and November
of each year. The grant date of any award granted at a May or November meeting
shall be the first day that Nasdaq is open in June following such May meeting,
or December following such November meeting (as the case may be). The new
procedures also require certain same day documentation. During the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company also implemented additional procedures for the
communication and recording of modifications and cancellations of stock option
grants.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

– Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
management’s evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2006.

Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting. This report appears below.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board
of Directors and Stockholders of

Hansen Natural Corporation

Corona, California

We have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Hansen Natural
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of the
inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.


In our
opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, of
the Company and our report dated June 5, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory
paragraph referring to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123R, “Share-based Payment” in 2006.

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and
executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered
class of the Company’s equity securities, to file by specific dates with the
SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of equity
securities of the Company.  Executive
officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by
SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
that they file.  The Company is required
to report in this annual report on Form 10-K any failure of its directors and

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Compensation
Philosophy

Our executive compensation program for Named
Executive Officers listed in the summary compensation table on the following
pages, whom we refer to as our NEOs, is designed to attract, as needed,
individuals with the skills necessary for us to achieve our business plan, to
motivate our executive talent, to reward those individuals fairly over time and
to retain those individuals who continue to perform at or above the levels that
are deemed essential to ensure our success. The program is also designed to
reinforce a sense of ownership, urgency and overall entrepreneurial spirit and
to link rewards to measurable corporate and individual performance.  In applying these principles we seek to
integrate compensation programs with our short and long term strategic plans
and to align the interests of the NEOs with the long term interests of
stockholders through award opportunities that can result in ownership of stock.

Compensation Program Components

The compensation programs for our NEOs are generally
administered by or under direction of the Compensation Committee (in the case
of Rodney Sacks, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Hilton
Schlosberg, the President and Chief Financial Officer), and the Executive
Committee (in the case of the other NEOs) and are reviewed on an annual basis
to ensure that remuneration levels and benefits are competitive and reasonable
and continue to achieve the goals set out in our compensation philosophy. On
January 1, 2007, we implemented a new policy regarding the issuance of stock
options, which is discussed below.

Neither we nor our Compensation Committee have
retained a compensation consultant to review policies and procedures with
respect to executive compensation or to advise the Company on compensation
matters.  While we do not set
compensation at set percentage levels relative to the market, we do seek to
provide salary, incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits that
are competitive within the industry and within the labor markets in which we
participate.

Our NEO compensation currently has three primary
components:  base compensation or salary,
discretionary annual bonus, and stock option awards granted pursuant to our
Hansen Natural Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan, which we refer to as the
2001 Stock Option Plan, which is described below under “Long Term Incentive
Programs.”

Each of the primary components of NEO compensation
is discussed below:

Base Salary

Base salaries for our NEOs are established based on
the scope of their respective responsibilities, taking into account competitive
market compensation paid by other companies for individuals in similar
positions.  Generally, in line with our
compensation philosophy, we believe that NEO base salaries


should be targeted near the median of the range for individuals in like
positions with similar responsibilities in comparable companies.  We fix NEO base compensation at levels which
we believe enable us to hire and retain individuals in a competitive
environment and to reward satisfactory performance at an acceptable level based
upon contributions to our overall business goals.  Base salaries are generally reviewed
annually, but may be adjusted from time to time to realign salaries with market
levels, taking into account such individual’s responsibilities, performance and
experience.  In reviewing base salaries,
we consider several factors, including cost of living increases, levels of
responsibility, experience, a comparison to base salaries paid for comparable
positions by our competitors and companies in our geography, as well as our own
base salaries for other executives and individual performance and results
achieved.  The annual review usually
occurs in the first quarter of each calendar year and has been completed for
fiscal 2006.  We may also utilize input
from executive search firms when making crucial hiring decisions.

Discretionary Annual Bonus

We provide incentive compensation to our NEOs in the
form of annual cash bonuses based on individual and company-wide financial and
operational performance and/or results, consistent with our emphasis on
pay-for-performance incentive compensation programs. These parameters vary
depending on the individual executive, but relate generally to strategic
factors such as sales, distribution levels, introduction of new products,
operating performance, contribution margins and profitability. We do not have a
formula for determination of annual cash bonuses with respect to our NEOs.  We generally utilize cash bonuses to reward
performance achievements for the time horizon of one year or less.

In some cases, the annual bonus amounts are
determined as a percentage of base salary. 
The actual amount of the annual bonus is determined and paid in the
first quarter following a review of each NEO’s individual performance and
contribution to our strategic goals during the prior year.

The Compensation Committee determines the annual
bonuses for Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg and the Executive Committee
(comprised of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief
Financial Officer) determines the annual bonuses for the other NEOs.  Annual bonuses typically include
discretionary bonus amounts that are awarded based on individual circumstances
deemed appropriate and fair by the relevant committee. The annual bonuses for
fiscal 2006 have been determined.

Long Term Incentive Program

We believe that long term performance is achieved
through an ownership culture that encourages superior performance by our NEOs
through the use of stock option awards. Our stock option plans have been
established to provide our NEOs with incentives to further align their
interests with the interests of the stockholders. Grants under stock option
plans vest over a number of years, generally up to 5 years.

Our 2001 Stock Option Plan authorizes us to grant
options to purchase shares of common stock to our employees.  The Compensation Committee is the
administrator of the Stock Option Plan and is authorized to grant stock options
to employees thereunder.  The Executive
Committee is also authorized to grant options thereunder.  Stock option grants are made to key employees
when they are hired and from time to time thereafter, as well as on occasion
following a significant change in their job responsibilities.  Prior to 2007, stock option grants were
generally made to existing NEOs at periodic intervals at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee or the Executive Committee. None of our NEOs were
awarded any stock option grants during 2006.

Effective January 1, 2007, we implemented a new
policy regarding the issuance of stock options. 
Under the new procedures, the Compensation Committee has sole and
exclusive authority to grant stock option awards to all employees who are not
new hires and to all new hires who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act.  The Compensation Committee and the
Executive Committee of the Board each independently has the authority to grant
awards to new hires who are not Section 16 employees. Awards


granted by the Executive Committee are not subject to approval or
ratification by the Board or the Compensation Committee. For purposes of these
procedures, a new hire means: (i) an employee who is commencing employment with
the Company or its subsidiaries; or (ii) an employee who is receiving a
promotion to a new position with the Company or one of its subsidiaries.  The grant date of any award to a new hire
shall be the first day that Nasdaq is open in the calendar month following the
employee’s commencement of employment or the date of the employee’s promotion
(as the case may be). Other than awards to new hires, awards may only be
granted at a single meeting held during the last two weeks of May and November
of each year. The grant date of any award granted at a May or November meeting
shall be the first day that Nasdaq is open in June following such May meeting,
or December following such November meeting (as the case may be). The new
procedures also require certain same day documentation.

The Compensation Committee will review and approve
stock option awards to our NEOs based upon a review of competitive compensation
data, its assessment of individual performance, a review of each executive’s
long term incentives and retention considerations.

Other Compensation

Certain NEOs who are parties to employment
agreements will continue to be subject to such agreements in their current form
until such time as the Compensation Committee determines in its discretion that
revisions to such employment agreements are advisable. Current employment
agreements have not been changed during their respective terms.  In addition, we intend to continue to
maintain our current benefits and perquisites for our NEOs, which include
automobile and benefit premiums, among other perquisites.  However, the Compensation Committee in its
discretion may revise, amend or add to such NEOs benefits and prerequisites if
it deems it advisable. We believe these benefits and perquisites are currently
in line with those provided by comparable companies for similarly situated
executives.

General

We view the above components of compensation as
related but distinct.  We do not believe
that significant compensation derived from one component of compensation should
negate or reduce compensation from other components.  We determine the appropriate level for each
compensation component based in part, but not exclusively, on competitive
benchmarks consistent with our recruiting and retention goals, our view of
internal equity and consistency and other considerations we deem relevant such
as rewarding performance.  We believe
that stock option awards should be granted for future performance and are an
important compensation related motivator to attract and retain executives and
that salary and bonus levels are secondary considerations to our NEOs.  Except as described herein, neither our
Compensation Committee nor our Executive Committee have adopted any formal or
informal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between short term
and long term and current compensation between cash and non-cash compensation.  However, our Compensation Committee and
Executive Committee’s respective philosophy is to make a greater percentage of
our NEOs compensation performance rewarded through equity rather than cash if
we perform well over time.  Each element
of compensation is determined differently for each individual NEO based on
specific facts and circumstances applicable at the time and to that specific
NEO.

Our Compensation Committee and Executive Committee’s
current intent is to perform at least annually a strategic review of our NEOs
compensation to determine whether they have provided adequate incentives and
motivation to our NEOs and whether they adequately compensate our NEOs relative
to comparable officers in other companies with which we compete for executives.  These companies may or may not be public
companies or even consumer product, food or beverage companies.  For compensation decisions, including
decisions regarding the grant of equity compensation relating to NEOs other than
our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial
Officer, the Compensation Committee specifically considers recommendations from
the Executive Committee.


Employee Benefit Plans

Our employees, including our NEOs, are entitled to
various employee benefits which include medical and dental care plans, car
allowances, other allowances, group life, disability, 401(k) plan as well as
paid time off.

401(k) Plan

Our employees, including our NEOs, may participate
in our 401(k) Plan, a defined contribution plan, which qualifies under Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Participating employees may contribute up to 15% of their pretax salary
up to statutory limits.  We contribute
25% of the employee contribution, up to 8% of each employee’s earnings, which
vest 20% each year for five years after the first anniversary date.

do not maintain or make contributions to a defined benefit plan for any

balances in non-qualified defined contribution plans or other deferred
compensation plans maintained by us.  The
Compensation Committee, which is comprised solely of “outside directors” as
defined for the purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, may
elect to provide our officers or other employees with non-qualified defined
contribution or deferred compensation benefits should they deem such benefits
appropriate.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL

We have entered into certain agreements and maintain
certain plans that may require us to make certain payments and/or provide
certain benefits to the NEOs in the event of a termination of employment or a
change of control.  The following tables
and narrative disclosure summarize the potential payments to each NEO assuming
that one of the events listed in the tables below occurs.  The tables assume that the event occurred on
December 31, 2006, the last day of our fiscal year.

Key Employment Agreement and Stock Option Agreement Definitions

For purposes of the employment agreements with Mr.
Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg described in this section, cause, (under which we may
terminate their employment),  is defined
as (i) an act or acts of dishonesty or gross misconduct on the executive’s part
which result or are intended to result in material damage to our business or
reputation or (ii) repeated material violations by the executive of his
obligations relating to his position and duties which violations are
demonstrably willful and deliberate on the executives part and which result in
material damage to our business or reputation and as to which material
violations our Board has notified the executive in writing.

For purposes of the employment agreements with Mr.
Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg described in this section, constructive termination,
(under which they may terminate their employment), is defined as (i) without
the written consent of the executive, (A) the assignment to the executive of
any duties inconsistent in any substantial respect with the executive’s
position, authority or responsibilities as contemplated by the position and
duties described in his employment agreement, or (B) any other substantial
adverse change in such position, including titles, authority or
responsibilities; (ii) any failure by us to comply with any of the provisions
of his employment agreement, other than an insubstantial or


inadvertent failure remedied by us promptly after receipt of notice
thereof given by the executive; (iii) our requiring the executive without his
consent to be based at any office location outside of Orange County, California
except for travel reasonably required in the performance of the executive’s
responsibilities; or (iv) any failure by us to obtain the assumption and
agreement to perform the employment agreement by a successor as contemplated by
Section 13(b) of the employment agreement, provided that the successor has had
actual written notice of the existence of the respective employment agreement
and its terms and an opportunity to assume our responsibilities under the
employment agreement during a period of 10 business days after receipt of such
notice.

For purposes of the employment agreements with Mr.
Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg described in this section, disability is defined as
disability which would entitle the executive to receive full long-term
disability benefits under our long-term disability plan, or if no such plan
shall then be in effect, any physical or mental disability or incapacity which
renders the executive incapable of performing the services required of him in
accordance with his obligations under Section 5 of the employment agreement for
a period of more than 120 days in the aggregate during any 12-month period
during the Employment Period.

For purposes of the stock option agreements with Mr.
Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg described in this section, change in control is
defined as (i) the acquisition of “Beneficial Ownership” by any person (as
defined in rule 13(d)–3 under the Exchange Act), corporation or other entity
other than us or a wholly owned subsidiary of 20% or more of our outstanding
stock, (ii) the sale or disposition of substantially all of our assets, or
(iii) our merger with another corporation in which our Common Stock is no
longer outstanding after such merger.

For purposes of the stock option agreements with Mr.
Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg described in this section, cause, (under which we may
terminate their employment), is defined as the individual’s act of fraud or
dishonesty, knowing and material failure to comply with applicable laws or
regulations or drug or alcohol abuse; and good reason, (under which they may terminate
their employment), is defined as a reduction in the individual’s compensation
or benefits, the individual’s removal from his current position or the
assignment to the individual of duties or responsibilities that are
inconsistent with the dignity, importance or scope of his position with us.

For purposes of all the stock option agreements
described in this section, total disability is defined as the complete and
permanent inability of the executive to perform all his duties of employment
with us.

For purposes of the employment offer letters with
Mr. Hall and Mr. Schott described in this section, cause, (under which we may
terminate their employment), shall mean an act of dishonesty, or reasons which
justify their summary dismissal.

For purposes of Mr. Schott’s employment offer
letter, a material change by us of the employee’s functions, duties and
responsibility, which materially reduces his position with us or a requirement
by us that he relocate to California without providing reasonable reimbursement
to him for moving expenses or a material reduction in the basic salary payable
by us to him, will constitute constructive termination entitling him to the
benefits of termination of his employment without cause.

For purposes of the stock option agreements with Mr.
Hall and Mr. Schott, (exclusive of Mr. Schott’s August 9, 2002 agreement)
described in this section, change in control is generally defined as (i) the
acquisition of “Beneficial Ownership” by any person (as defined in Rule 13(d)–3
under the Exchange Act ), corporation or other entity other than us or a wholly
owned subsidiary of ours of 50% or more of our outstanding stock, (ii) the sale
or disposition of substantially all of our assets, or (iii) our merger with
another corporation in which our Common Stock is no longer outstanding after
such merger.

For purposes of the stock option agreement with Mr.
Schott dated August 9, 2002 described within, change in control is generally
defined as (i) the acquisition of “Beneficial Ownership” by any person (as
defined in rule 13(d)–3 under the Exchange Act ), corporation or other entity
other than us or a wholly owned subsidiary of ours of 30% or more of our
outstanding stock, (ii) the sale or disposition of substantially all of our
assets, or (iii) our merger with another corporation in which our Common Stock
is no longer outstanding after such merger.


For purposes of the stock option agreements with Mr.
Hall, Mr. Schott and Mr. Kelly described in this section, cause, (under which
we may terminate their employment), is defined as the individual’s act of fraud
or dishonesty, knowing and material failure to comply with applicable laws or
regulations or satisfactorily perform his duties of employment, insubordination
or drug or alcohol abuse.

Employee
Stock Option Plans

The Company has a stock option plan (the “Plan”) that provided for the
grant of options to purchase up to 24,000,000 shares of the common stock of the
Company to certain key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Options granted under the Plan may either be
incentive stock options qualified under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, or non-qualified options.  Such options are exercisable at fair market
value on the date of grant for a period of up to ten years.  Under the Plan, shares subject to options may
be purchased for cash, or for shares of common stock valued at fair market
value on the date of purchase.  Under the
Plan, no additional options may be granted after July 1, 2001.

During 2001, the Company adopted the Hansen Natural Corporation 2001
Stock Option Plan (“2001 Option Plan”). 
The 2001 Option Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase up to
22,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company to certain key employees
of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Options granted under the 2001 Stock Option Plan may be incentive stock
options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”),
nonqualified stock options, or stock appreciation rights.

The Plan and the 2001 Option Plan are administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, comprised of directors who
satisfy the “non-employee” director requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the “outside director” provision of Section
162(m) of the Code.  Grants under the
Plan and the 2001 Option Plan are made pursuant to individual agreements
between the Company and each grantee that specifies the terms of the grant,
including the exercise price, exercise period, vesting and other terms thereof.


Outside Directors Stock Option Plans

The Company had an option plan for its outside directors (the “Directors
Plan”) that provided for the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of
800,000 shares of common stock of the Company to directors of the Company who
are not and have not been employed by or acted as consultants to the Company
and its subsidiaries or affiliates and who are not and have not been nominated
to the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to a contractual arrangement.
Under the Directors Plan, no additional options could be granted after November
30, 2004.

During 2005, the Company adopted the 2005 Hansen Natural Corporation
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (“2005 Directors Plan”) that
provides for the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of 800,000
shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee directors of the
Company.  On the date of the annual
meeting of stockholders at which an eligible director is initially elected,
each eligible director is entitled to receive a one-time grant of an option to
purchase 24,000 shares of the Company’s common stock exercisable at the closing
price for a share of common stock on the date of grant.  Additionally, on the fifth anniversary of the
election of eligible directors elected or appointed to the Board, and each
fifth anniversary thereafter, each eligible director shall receive an
additional grant of an option to purchase 19,200 shares of the Company’s common
stock.  Options become exercisable in
four equal installments, with the grant immediately vested with respect to 25%
of the grant and the remaining installments vesting on the three successive
anniversaries of the date of grant; provided that all options held by an
eligible director become fully and immediately exercisable upon a change in
control of the Company.  Options granted
under the 2005 Directors Plan that are not exercised generally expire ten years
after the date of grant.  Option grants
may be made under the 2005 Directors Plan for ten years from the effective date
of the Directors Plan.  The Directors
Plan is a “formula plan” so that a non-employee director’s participation in the
Directors Plan does not affect his status as a “disinterested person” (as
defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Four eligible directors were initially
granted options to purchase 19,200 shares of the Company’s common stock
pursuant to the 2005 Directors Plan, (see “Part III, Item 12 – Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Related Stockholder Matters”).

ITEM 13.               CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED
TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

The
Board has determined that Messrs. Epstein, Taber, Selati and Vidergauz are
independent directors under applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and SEC Rules.
In addition, the Board has also determined that all directors who serve on the
Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees are independent under applicable
Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and SEC rules.

Each director and nominee for election as director
delivers to the company annually a questionnaire that includes, among other
things, a request for information relating to any transactions in which both
the director or nominee, or their family members, and the company participates,
and in which the director or nominee, or such family member, has a material
interest.

The Audit Committee, among
its other duties and responsibilities, reviews and monitors all related party
transactions. The Audit Committee will assess, among factors it deems
appropriate, whether the transaction is on terms no more favorable than terms
generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar
circumstances and the extent of the related party’s interest in the
transaction. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing all related party
transactions on a continuing basis and potential conflict of interest
situations where appropriate. No director shall participate in any discussion
or approval of a transaction for which he is a related party, except that this
director shall provide all material information concerning the transaction to
the Audit Committee.

loss or liability arising out of his acting as Trustee.

During 2006, we purchased promotional items from IFM Group, Inc. (“IFM”).  Rodney C. Sacks, together with members of his
family, own approximately 27% of the issued shares in IFM.  Hilton H. Schlosberg, together with members
of his family, own approximately 58% of the issued shares in IFM.  Purchases from IFM of promotional items in
2006, 2005 and 2004 were $1.0 million, $0.7 million and $0.6 million,
respectively.  We continue to purchase
promotional items from IFM Group, Inc. in 2007.

& Touche have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee has considered whether Deloitte & Touche’s
provision of the non-audit services covered above is compatible with
maintaining Deloitte & Touche’s independence and has determined that it is.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval of
Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors

The Audit Committee’s
policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the
Company’s independent auditors.  These
services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and
other services.  Pre-approval is
generally provided for up to one year, and any pre-approval is detailed as to
the particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a
specific budget.  The Audit Committee has
delegated pre-approval authority to its Chairman when necessary due to timing
considerations.  Any services approved by
the Chairman must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled
meeting.  The independent auditors and
management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee
regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditors in
accordance with the pre-approval policies, and the fees for the services
performed to date.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of

Hansen Natural Corporation

Corona, California

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hansen Natural
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. 
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item
15(a).  These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed
in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
its method of accounting for stock-based compensation during the year ended
December 31, 2006 as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123R, “Share-based Payment” in 2006.

We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated June 5, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

1.

ORGANIZATION
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization

– Hansen Natural Corporation (the “Company” or “Hansen”)
was incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 1990. The Company is a holding
company and has no operating business except through its direct wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Hansen Beverage Company (“HBC”) which was incorporated in
Delaware on June 8, 1992 and Monster LDA Company (“MLDA”) formally known as
Hard e Beverage Company, and previously known as Hard Energy Company and CVI
Ventures, Inc., which was incorporated in Delaware on April 30, 1990.  HBC conducts the vast majority of the Company’s
operating business and generates substantially all of the Company’s operating
revenues. References herein to “Hansen” or the “Company” when used to describe
the operating business of the Company are references to the business of HBC
unless otherwise indicated, and references herein to MLDA when used to describe
the operating business of MLDA, are to the business of MLDA unless otherwise
indicated.

In addition, HBC,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co. (“Blue Sky”)
and Hansen Junior Juice Company (“Junior Juice”) owns and operates the natural
soda business under the Blue Sky® trademark and the Junior Juice beverage
business under the Junior Juice® trademarks, respectively.

Nature of Operations

– The Company develops, markets, sells and distributes “alternative”
beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices, energy drinks and energy sports
drinks, fruit juice smoothies and “functional drinks,” non-carbonated
ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, children’s multi-vitamin
juice drinks, Junior Juice® juices and non-carbonated lightly flavored energy
waters under the Hansen’s® brand name. 
The Company also develops, markets, sells and distributes energy drinks
under the following brand names; Monster Energy®, Lost® Energy™, Joker Mad
Energy™, Unbound Energy® and Ace™ brand names as well as Rumba™ brand energy
juice. The Company also develops, markets, sells and distributes Java Monster™
non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. The Company also markets, sells and
distributes natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic
natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue
Sky® brand name. The Company’s fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under the
Junior Juice® brand name.  The Company
also markets, sells and distributes vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered
form under the Fizzit™ brand name.

Basis of Presentation

– The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

Principles of Consolidation

– The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, HBC, MLDA, Blue Sky and Junior Juice
since their respective dates of incorporation. 
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Stock Split

and
Amendment of Articles of Incorporation

– On August 8, 2005, the
Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of the Company’s common
stock which was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  On June 1, 2006 the Company, after
stockholder approval, increased the number of authorized shares of common stock
to 120,000,000. On June 7, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-one
stock split of the Company’s common stock which was effected in the form of a
300% stock dividend.  The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the effects of the stock splits and
the resulting increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock.  All share and per-share amounts have been
recast to reflect the individual stock splits.


Cash and Cash Equivalents

–

The Company invests available cash in various investments
from time to time including, but not limited to, investments of the following
nature:  auction rate securities,
corporate bank debt, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury
bills, notes and bonds, money market funds and tax exempt securities, including
municipal notes.  Those investments that
have original maturities of three months or less are included in cash and cash
equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at
financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits.  The Company has not experienced any loss as a
result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future.

Short-Term Investments

— Those
investments that have original maturities greater than three months but less
than twelve months are included in short-term investments.  The Company classifies debt securities in one
of two categories: held-to-maturity or available-for-sale in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”).
Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold until maturity.  All other securities not included in
held-to-maturity category are classified as available-for-sale.  No securities are held for speculative or
trading purposes.  For all short-term
investments, unrealized losses that are considered “other than temporary” are
recognized immediately in earnings. Realized and unrealized gains and losses
were not material in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Accounts Receivable –

The Company
evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number
of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific
customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a
specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the
recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will
ultimately be collected.  In addition to
specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are
recorded based on the Company’s recent past loss history and an overall
assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

Inventories

– Inventories are
valued at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market value (net
realizable value).

Property and Equipment

– Property
and equipment are stated at cost. 
Depreciation of furniture, office equipment, equipment and vehicles is
based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated
using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based
on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related
leases and is calculated using the straight-line method.

Intangibles

– Intangibles are
comprised of trademarks representing the Company’s exclusive ownership of the
Hansen’s® trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution
of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy® trademark in
connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and
beverages.  The Company also owns a
number of other trademarks in the United States as well as in a number of
countries around the world.  In addition,
the Company owns the Blue Sky® trademark, which was acquired in September 2000,
and the Junior Juice® trademark, which was acquired in May 2001.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when
events indicate that an impairment exits. The Company calculates impairment as
the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their
estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value
a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite
useful lives over the trademarks’ useful lives of 1 to 25 years.


Long-Lived
Assets

– Management regularly reviews property and equipment
and other long-lived assets, including certain intangibles, for possible
impairment.  This review occurs annually,
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. 
If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an
estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges)
expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If these cash flows are less than the
carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down
the asset to its estimated fair value. 
The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash
flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s estimates of the
business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is
inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions
concerning expected future conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company recognized impairment on operating equipment in cost of sales of
$0.6 million.  For 2006 and 2005, there
were no impairment losses recorded.

Revenue Recognition

– The Company
recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured.

Management
believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and
spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. Amounts paid to the
Company by newly appointed Anheuser-Busch Distributors (the “AB Distributors”)
for the costs of terminating certain of the Company’s prior distributors are
accounted for as deferred revenue, which will be recognized as revenue ratably
over the anticipated 20 year life of the respective Anheuser-Busch Distribution
Agreements (the “AB Distribution Agreements”) (see Note 17).

Net Sales

– Net sales have been determined after
deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) No. 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendo

r’

s Products).

Cost of Sales

– Cost of sales consists of the
costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing
fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal
transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the
Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs.  Raw materials account for the largest portion
of the cost of sales.  Raw materials
include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials.

Operating Expenses

– Operating expenses
include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to
customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for
advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise
displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses,
other marketing expenses and design expenses. 
Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel
costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments
made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation and other
general and administrative costs.

Freight
Costs and Reimbursement of Freight Costs

– For the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, freight-out costs amounted to $36.2
million, $19.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively, and have been recorded
in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Advertising
Expenses

– The Company accounts for advertising production
costs by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising
takes place. Advertising expenses, including but not limited to production
costs, amounted to $35.7 million, $18.0 and $10.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
Advertising expenses are included in operating expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.


Income
Taxes

– The Company accounts for income taxes under the
provisions of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes

. This statement requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been
recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of
the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws.  In the event the future consequences of
differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the Company’s
assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset, SFAS No. 109 requires an
evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits
indicated by such asset.  A valuation
allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.

Stock-Based
Compensation

– Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company
accounted for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”), and related interpretations, the
disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Related to Options Issued to Employees

, and SFAS No.
148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

–

Transition and Disclosure

–

an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.

Under APB No. 25, the Company
recognized stock-based compensation associated with stock options and awards
under the intrinsic value method, whereby stock-based compensation was
determined as the difference, if any, between the fair value of the related
common stock on the measurement date and the price an employee had to pay to
exercise the award.

Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”) using the
modified-perspective-transition method and therefore has not restated prior
period results (See Note 12, “Stock-Based Compensation”).  This Statement replaces SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

and supersedes APB
No. 25.  SFAS No. 123R requires the fair
value of all stock option awards issued to employees to be recorded as an
expense over the related vesting period. 
The Statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for
the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of
adoption. The Company recognizes these compensation costs net of a forfeiture
rate on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the reward,
which is generally the vesting term of five years.  The Company estimated the forfeiture rate for
fiscal 2006 based on historical experience with forfeitures during the preceding
three fiscal years.

Net
Income Per Common Share

– In accordance with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per Share

, net income per common share, on a basic
and diluted basis, is presented for all periods.  Basic net income per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during each period.  Diluted net income
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of
common equivalent shares assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of
assumed treasury share repurchases at average market prices, as applicable.

Concentration
of Risk

–

Certain of the
Company’s products utilize components (raw materials and/or co-packing
services) from a limited number of sources. 
A disruption in the supply of such components could significantly affect
the Company’s revenues from those products, as alternative sources of such
components may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or within a
reasonably short time period.  The
Company continues to take steps on an ongoing basis to secure the availability
of alternative sources for such components and minimize the risk of any
disruption in production.


Two customers accounted for approximately 19% and 12% of the Company’s
net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively. One customer
accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the Company’s net sales for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A decision by either
customer, or any other large customer, to decrease the amount purchased from
the Company or to cease carrying the Company’s products could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and consolidated results of
operations.

Credit
Risk

– The Company sells its products nationally, primarily
to retailers and beverage distributors. 
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral. 
The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, and
historically, such losses have been within management’s expectations.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

– At December 31, 2006 and
2005, the carrying values of cash, short term investments, accounts receivable
and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of
these financial instruments.  Long-term
debt bears interest at a rate comparable to the prime rate; therefore,
management believes the carrying amount for the outstanding borrowings at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, approximates fair value.

Use of
Estimates

– The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Newly
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

– On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs

.  SFAS
No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,

Inventory Pricing

, to clarify the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
material.  SFAS No. 151 requires that
those items be recognized as current-period charges and requires that
allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities.  The adoption of this statement had no impact
on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets

–

An Amendment of APB Opinion No.

,

Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions

. 
SFAS No. 153 amends Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 29
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary
assets that do not have commercial substance. 
A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows
of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
The adoption of this statement had no impact on the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

, which establishes,
unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for
reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit
transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The
statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application
of a change in accounting principle is impracticable. The statement also
addresses the reporting of a correction of error by restating previously issued
financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
The adoption of this statement had no impact on the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company.


In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes

.
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum
recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before tax
benefits associated with such uncertain tax positions are recognized in the
financial statements.  FIN 48 also
provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. In addition,
FIN 48 excludes income taxes from the scope of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting
for Contingencies

. FIN 48 also requires that amounts recognized in
the balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions be classified as a current
or noncurrent liability and upon adoption of FIN 48, will reclassify to
noncurrent liabilities those uncertain tax positions for which a cash tax
payment is not expected within the next twelve months. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and interim periods within those
fiscal years.  Differences between the
amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets prior to the adoption of
FIN 48 and the amounts reported after the adoption are accounted for as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. The
Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. The impact of the Company’s
reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a
material effect on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

which defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements.  The provisions
of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007 and interim period within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the
effect of adopting SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company adopted
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatement when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements” (“SAB No. 108”).  SAB No. 108
requires the use of both the rollover and iron curtain approaches in
accumulating and quantifying the amounts of misstatements in a company’s
financial statements.  The rollover
approach quantifies a misstatement based upon the amount of the error
originating in the current year income statement.  The iron curtain approach quantifies a
misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in
the balance sheet at the end of a reporting period.

The Company’s adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115

(SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. The provisions of SFAS No.159 are effective as of the beginning of our
2008 fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated financial statements.


2.

SHORT-TERM
INVESTMENTS

The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments having
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  All investments with original maturities
greater than three months but less than twelve months are considered to be
short-term investments.

The Company classifies debt securities in one of two categories:
held-to-maturity or available-for-sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115.  Held-to-maturity securities are those
securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until
maturity.  All other securities not
included in held-to-maturity category are classified as
available-for-sale.  No securities are
held for speculative or trading purposes.

Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates
fair market value.  A decline in the
market value of any held-to-maturity security below cost that is deemed other
than temporary, results in a reduction in its carrying amount to fair value.  The impairment is charged to earnings and a
new cost basis for the security is established. 
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the
related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the
effective-interest method.  The Company
evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than
temporary at each quarter-end.  This
evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing
information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic
trends in the industry and information on the investee company’s financial
condition.  Realized and unrealized gains
and losses were not material in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004.

Amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains and losses and fair
value for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity short-term investments at
December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows:

LONG-TERM DEBT

HBC has a credit
facility from Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a revolving line of
credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions
of the credit facility, HBC increased its available borrowing under the

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating Leases

– The Company
leases its main warehouse facility and corporate offices under a 10 year lease
expiring in 2010. In addition, the Company maintains certain equipment and
other noncancelable operating leases which expire through 2010.  The facility lease has scheduled rent
increases which are accounted for on a straight-line basis.  Rent expense under such leases amounted to
$1.3 million, $1.1 million, and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company also leased additional warehouse
space with such lease expiring in March 2008 with an option to renew through
2010. This facility was subsequently sublet on April 1, 2007.

In October 2006, the Company entered into a lease
agreement pursuant to which the Company leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse
and distribution space located in Corona, California.  This lease commitment provides for minimum
rental payments for 120 months commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options.  The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at
the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the
end of each 30 month period.  The new
warehouse and distribution space will replace the Company’s existing warehouse
and distribution space located in Corona, California.  The Company plans to sublet its existing
office, warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of the lease term,
unless the Company is able to find a tenant acceptable to the landlord and the
landlord agrees to the early termination of the lease.

In October 2006, the Company also entered into an
agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4
million, located adjacent to the new leased warehouse and distribution facility
located in Corona, California for the purpose of constructing a new office
building thereon which will replace the Company’s existing office space in
Corona, California.  The Company
anticipates the close of escrow for the purchase of such land within the next
few months.  In the interim, the Company
has leased additional office space located near the existing corporate offices.


Future minimum rental payments at December 31, 2006
under the operating leases referred to above are as follows:

Purchase
Commitments

– The Company has purchase commitments
aggregating approximately $25.4 million, which represent commitments made by
the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the
manufacturing and packaging of its products. 
These obligations vary in terms.

In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply
agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company (“Rexam”) dated as
of January 1, 2006, as amended, the Company has undertaken to purchase a
minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the
four year period commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31,
2009.  Should the Company fail to
purchase the minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam
for certain capital reimbursements on a pro-rated basis.  The Company’s maximum liability under this
agreement is $8.6 million subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of
conditions under this agreement.

The Company purchases various raw material items, including, but not
limited to, flavors, ingredients and containers, from a limited number of
resources.  An interruption in supply
from any of such resources could result in the Company’s inability to produce
certain products for limited or possibly extended periods of time.  The aggregate value of purchases from
suppliers of such limited resources described above for the year ended December
31, 2006 was $120.5 million.

Advertising Commitment

– In March 2003, HBC entered into an
advertising display agreement (“Monorail Agreement”) with the Las Vegas
Monorail Company (“LVMC”) whereby HBC was granted the right, in consideration
of the payment by HBC to LVMC of the sum of $1.0 million per year, payable
quarterly installments, to advertise and promote its products on a designated
four car monorail vehicle as well as the right to sell certain of its products
on all monorail stations for payment of additional consideration. The initial
term of the Monorail Agreement commenced on January 1, 2005 and has been
renewed annually thereafter. The Company renewed the Monorail Agreement for
2007 but at a lower annual rate.

Licensing Agreements

– The Company produces, sells and distributes Lost®
Energy™ drinks under an exclusive license with Lost International LLC.  The license agreement requires certain
royalty payments to be made related to the sale of Lost® brand products.  Royalty expense under this agreement for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $0.7 million, $0.6 million,
and $0.4 million, respectively.


Litigation

– In June 2006, HBC filed a lawsuit
against Rockstar, Inc., Rockstar Beverage Corporation and Rockstar Brewing
Company, Inc., all Nevada corporations (collectively “Rockstar”) for false
designation of origin, trademark infringement, unfair competition, deceptive
trade practices and unfair competition, seeking an injunction and damages based
on Rockstar’s unauthorized use of HBC’s valuable and distinctive Monster
Energy®  trade dress in connection with
its alcoholic energy beverage known as “Rockstar 21.”  HBC alleges that the overall appearance of
Rockstar’s “Rockstar 21” beverage container is confusingly similar to the
appearance of HBC’s Monster Energy® beverages. 
Further, HBC alleges that Rockstar is infringing on other trademarks
owned and used by HBC.  Rockstar has
denied HBC’s allegations and filed counterclaims against HBC based on
allegations that HBC has removed and destroyed Rockstar point-of-sale
advertisements from retail stores.  Hansen believes Rockstar’s
counterclaims are without merit and intends to diligently defend against those
counterclaims.  In September 2006, the
court dismissed HBC’s claims on summary judgment and Rockstar’s counterclaims
were withdrawn without prejudice.  Hansen
has appealed the court’s decision which is currently pending before the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

In August 2006, HBC filed a lawsuit against National Beverage Company,
Shasta Beverages, Inc., Newbevco Inc. and Freek’N Beverage Corp. (collectively “National”)
seeking an injunction and damages for trademark infringement, trademark
dilution, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices based on National’s
unauthorized use of HBC’s valuable and distinctive Monster Energy® trade dress
in connection with a line of energy drinks it launched under the “Freek” brand
name. On October 5, 2006 the United States District Court for the Central
District of California issued a preliminary injunction enjoining National from
manufacturing, distributing, shipping, marketing, selling or offering to sell
Freek energy drinks in containers that are the same or similar to the current
containers or any containers confusingly similar to HBC’s current Monster
Energy® trade dress.  National has
appealed the decision of the United States District Court for the Central
District of California to grant the preliminary injunction and this appeal is
currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.  National has filed a counter
claim against HBC for injunctive relief preventing HBC and its agents from
continuing to destroy “Freek” point of sale materials, disparaging “Freek”
products and intentionally interfering with National’s economic and business
relationships.  Based on the allegations
contained in the National counter claims, the Company believes the National
claims are without merit. The trial in the above complaint for HBC’s claims for
a permanent injunction, damages and costs, and with respect to National’s
counter claims, is scheduled to begin on August 7, 2007.  The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
predicted with certainty.

In August 2006, HBC filed an action in the Federal Courts of Australia,
Victoria District Registry against Bickfords Australia (Pty) Limited and Meak
(Pty) Ltd. (collectively “Bickfords”), in which HBC is seeking an injunction
restraining Bickfords from selling or offering for sale or promoting for sale
in Australia any energy drink or beverage under the Monster Energy or Monster
marks or any similar marks and for damages and costs.  The hearing took place in February 2007 and
was adjourned for argument to be presented to the court in June 2007.

In September 2006,
Christopher Chavez purporting to act on behalf of himself and a class of
consumers yet to be defined filed an action in the United States District
Court, Northern District of California, against the Company and its
subsidiaries for unfair business practices, false advertising, violation of
California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation
alleging that the company misleadingly labels its Blue Sky beverages as
originating in and/or being canned under the authority of a company located in
Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The Company has
been advised by counsel that it has valid defenses to Chavez’s class action
lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend the action.


The Company is subject to litigation from time to time in the normal
course of business.  Although it is not
possible to predict the outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to
the Company and after consultation with counsel, management believes that such
litigation in the aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Derivative Litigation

- From November 2006 through January 2007, purported derivative
lawsuits relating to the Company’s past stock option grants were filed by
parties identifying themselves as shareholders of Hansen.  These lawsuits name as defendants certain of
Hansen’s current and former employees, officers and directors, and name Hansen
as a nominal defendant.  Three of these
cases, Chandler v. Sacks, et al. (No. RIC460186), Plotkin v. Sacks, et al.
(No. RIC460485), and Alama v. Sacks, et al. (No. RIC463968), were filed in
the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside (the “State Derivative
Actions”).  Two additional shareholder
derivative lawsuits, Linan v. Sacks, et al. (No. ED CV 06-01393) and Cribbs v.
Blower et al. (No. ED CV 07-00037), were filed in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California. 
On March 26, 2007, the Cribbs and Linan actions were consolidated for
all purposes before the District Court, which appointed lead and local counsel
and restyled the action as In re Hansen Natural Corporation Derivative
Litigation (No. ED CV 07-37 JFW (PLAx)) (the “Federal Derivative Action”).

Plaintiffs in both the State Derivative Actions and the Federal
Derivative Action, who purport to bring suit on behalf of the Company, have
made no demand on the Board of Directors and allege that such demand is
excused.  The complaints in the
derivative actions allege, among other things, that by improperly dating
certain Hansen stock option grants, defendants breached their fiduciary duties,
wasted corporate assets, unjustly enriched themselves and violated federal and
California statutes.  Plaintiffs seek,
among other things, unspecified damages to be paid to Hansen, corporate
governance reforms, an accounting, rescission, restitution and the creation of
a constructive trust.

On April 4, 2007, the plaintiff in the Chandler action applied for a
temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, seeking, inter alia,
to restrain an April 20, 2007 shareholders meeting, to impose restrictions on
the defendants’ ability to issue or exercise stock options or to transfer the
proceeds of stock option grants, and to compel discovery.  On April 6, 2007, the Superior Court of
California denied plaintiff’s application for a temporary restraining order in
its entirety.  On April 24, 2007, the
plaintiff in the Chandler action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction
again seeking, inter alia, to impose restrictions on the defendants’ ability to
issue or exercise stock options or to transfer the proceeds of stock option
grants, and to compel discovery. On April 24, 2007, defendants filed a motion
to consolidate the State Derivative Actions as well as a motion seeking to stay
the State Derivative Actions.  By
stipulation that was so ordered by the Court on May 25, 2007, the parties
agreed to resolve the April 24, 2007 motions as follows: (i) the Chandler and
Plotkin actions are now consolidated; (ii) the consolidated State Derivative
Actions are stayed for all purposes until February 29, 2008; and (iii) the
motion for a preliminary injunction has been withdrawn and may not be refiled
while the stay is pending.

On April 16, 2007, the Alama v. Sacks lawsuit filed in California
Superior Court was voluntarily dismissed. 
On May 23, 2007, Alama filed a substantially similar complaint in the
Chancery Court of Delaware, New Castle County (No. 2978).

On April 11, 2007, plaintiffs in the Federal Derivative Action filed an
application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction
seeking to prevent an April 20, 2007, shareholders meeting and alleged
violation of federal laws relating to proxy statements.  On April 16, 2007, the District Court denied
plaintiffs’ application for a temporary restraining order and sua sponte
ordered plaintiffs to show cause why sanctions should not be issued against
plaintiffs’ law firm for the filing of a frivolous motion. On May 30,
2007, the District Court, while noting that it still found that plaintiffs’
application for a temporary restraining order “bordered on the frivolous,”
declined to impose sanctions against plaintiffs’ law firm. On April 23, 2007,
the Federal Derivative Action plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated
complaint. The Company must answer or otherwise respond to the complaint by
June 11, 2007.


Based on the allegations contained in the complaints, the Company
believes that Plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, and the Company intends to
vigorously defend against the lawsuits. 
However, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with
certainty.

Securities Litigation

- From November 2006 through December 2006, several plaintiffs filed
shareholder class actions in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California against Hansen and certain of its employees, officers
and directors, entitled Hutton v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-07599),
Kingery v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-07771), Williams v. Hansen
Natural Corp., et al. (No. 06-01369), Ziolkowski v. Hansen Natural Corp., et
al. (No. ED 06-01403), Walker v. Hansen Natural Corp., et al. (No.
06-08229) (the “Class Actions”).  On
February 27, 2007, the Class Actions were consolidated by the District Court
and styled as In re Hansen Natural Corporation Securities Litigation
(CV06-07599 JFW (PLAx)).  The Court
appointed Jason E. Peltier as lead plaintiff (“Lead Plaintiff”) and
approved lead counsel.  Lead Plaintiff
filed a consolidated class action complaint on April 30, 2007.  The consolidated class action complaint
supersedes all previously filed class action complaints and is the operative
complaint to which the Company must respond. The Company must answer or
otherwise respond to the complaint by June 25, 2007.  Lead Plaintiff alleges, on behalf of all
persons who purchased Hansen common stock during the period beginning November
12, 2001 through November 9, 2006 (the “Class Period”), that Hansen and the
individual defendants made misleading statements and omissions of material fact
which artificially inflated the market price of Hansen common stock throughout
the Class Period.  Plaintiffs further
allege that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by misrepresenting
or failing to disclose that defendants incorrectly dated stock option grants,
that the Company’s internal controls were inadequate, and that, as a result,
defendants engaged in improper accounting practices.  Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of
damages.

Based on the allegations contained in the amended consolidated
complaint, the Company believes that Plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, and
the Company intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.  However, the ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be predicted with certainty.

Guarantees

– The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that
contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third party
claims.  These contracts primarily relate
to: (i) certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and employees
under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for
liabilities arising out of their employment relationship, (ii) certain
distribution or purchase agreements under which the Company may have to
indemnify the Company’s customers from any claim, liability or loss arising out
of any actual or alleged injury or damages suffered in connection with the
consumption or purchase of the Company’s products, and (iii) certain real
estate leases, under which the Company may be required to indemnify property
owners for liabilities and other claims arising from the Company’s use of the
applicable premises. The terms of such obligations vary and typically, a
maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Generally, the Company believes
that its insurance coverage is adequate to cover any liabilities or claims
arising out of such instances. Consequently, the Company does not believe the
potential exposure related to these guarantees is material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

The
Company has determined that no liability is probable or likely related to these
guarantees and indemnities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

Effective January
1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, which requires
the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS
No. 123R supersedes the Company’s previous accounting methodology using the
intrinsic value method under APB 25.

The Company
adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under
this transition method, compensation expense recognized during the year ended
December 31, 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all share-based awards
granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 31, 2005, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFAS No. 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes and (b) compensation expense for
all share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been
restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R.

On November 10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position No. FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election Related
to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

. The
Company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this
FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation
pursuant to SFAS 123R. The alternative transition method includes simplified
methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital
pool (“APIC Pool”) related to the tax effects of employee share-based
compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC Pool and
consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee and
director share-based awards that were outstanding upon the adoption of SFAS
123R.


The Company has two stock option plans under which
shares were available for grant at December 31, 2006: the 2001 Hansen Natural
Corporation Stock Option Plan (the “2001 Option Plan”) and the 2005 Hansen
Natural Corporation Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2005
Directors Plan”).

The 2001 Option Plan
permits the granting of options to purchase up to 22,000,000 shares of the
common stock of the Company to certain key employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries.  Options granted under the
2001 Option Plan may be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code, as amended, non-qualified stock options or stock
appreciation rights.  Stock options are
exercisable at such time and in such amounts as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company up to a ten-year period after
their date of grant.  As of December 31,
2006, options to purchase 15,820,750 shares of the Company’s common stock had
been granted, net of cancellations, and options to purchase 6,179,250 shares of
the Company’s common stock remain available for grant under the 2001 Option
Plan.

The
2005 Directors Plan permits the granting of options to purchase up to an
aggregate of 800,000 shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee
directors of the Company.  On the date of
the annual meeting of stockholders at which an eligible director is initially
elected, each eligible director is entitled to receive a one-time grant of an
option to purchase 24,000 shares of the Company’s common stock exercisable at
the closing price for a share of common stock on the date of grant.
Additionally, on the fifth anniversary of the election of eligible directors
elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, and each fifth anniversary
thereafter, each eligible director shall receive an additional grant of an
option to purchase 19,200 shares of the Company’s common stock.  Options become exercisable in four equal
installments, with the grant immediately vested with respect to 25% of the
grant and the remaining installments vesting on the three successive
anniversaries of the date of grant; provided that all options held by an
eligible director become fully and immediately exercisable upon a change in
control of the Company.  Options granted
under the 2005 Directors Plan that are not exercised generally expire ten years
after the date of grant.  Option grants
may be made under the 2005 Directors Plan for ten years from the effective date
of the 2005 Directors Plan.  The 2005
Directors Plan is a “formula plan” so that a non-employee director’s
participation in the 2005 Directors Plan does not affect his status as a “disinterested
person” (as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”)).  As of
December 31, 2006, options to purchase 76,800 shares of the Company’s common
stock had been granted under the 2005 Directors Plan and options to purchase
723,200 shares of the Company’s common stock remained available for grant.

Under the Company’s stock option plans, grants are
required to be made at the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant.  Outstanding options generally
vest over periods ranging from two to five years from the grant date and
generally expire up to ten years after the grant date. As discussed more fully
in Note 13, the Company changed measurement dates for a limited number of
grants issued in prior periods which resulted in the per share exercise price
of the stock options subject to those grants being below the per share common
stock price on the adjusted measurement dates for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. In addition, the Company identified a limited number of
grants which, due to mistakes, had minor pricing errors. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, the Company recorded $8.3 million of compensation expense
(including $0.1 million for the matters discussed above and $1.0 million as a
result of errors in the application of APB No. 25 and SFAS No. 123R with
respect to a grant modification and a grant cancellation, all discussed more
fully in Note 13).  No compensation
expense was recorded related to outstanding options during the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004.


The Company records compensation expense for employee
stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the
assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses historical data to
determine the exercise behavior, volatility and forfeiture rate of the
options.  The following weighted-average
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

REVIEW OF HISTORIC STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES

On October 26, 2006, the
Company received a letter from the Staff of the Pacific Regional Office of the
SEC requesting that the Company voluntarily produce certain documents and
information relating to the filing of SEC Forms 4 and the Company’s stock
option granting practices from January 1, 1996 to the present.  The SEC subsequently agreed, in the absence
of any further requests, to limit the voluntary production of certain documents
and information from January 1, 2001 to the present. The Company has cooperated
with the SEC and believes it has completed its production of the documents and
information requested in the October 26, 2006 letter.

In November 2006, the Company
appointed a special committee of the Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”)
to undertake an independent investigation relating to its stock option grants
and its stock option granting practices. The Special Committee retained
independent counsel and accounting advisors to assist in conducting the
investigation. The Special Committee reviewed all stock option grants from
January 1, 2001 through November 13, 2006. 
In the course of its investigation, the Special Committee reviewed
documents and emails and extensively interviewed numerous officers and
directors, as well as certain other personnel. The Special Committee has
completed its independent investigation.

Based on the Special Committee’s review of all stock option grants and
the Company’s evaluation of applicable accounting rules, management concluded
that the terms with respect to 10 new hire grants and two merit grants had not
been determined with finality as at the grant date, resulting in a decision to
change the measurement dates for such grants. Additionally, seven grants were
identified where the stock option agreements mistakenly reflected the exercise
price at either the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date
prior to the grant date or the opening price of the Company’s common stock on
the grant date instead of the closing price on the grant date, resulting in
minor pricing errors. The pre-tax compensation expense resulting from the
above-described accounting errors is approximately $0.1 million, which should
have been recorded within operating expenses over the period from January 1,
2001 through the second quarter ended June 30, 2006.

Additionally, the Company
identified one grant where there was an error in the application of APB No. 25
related to a grant modification given to a non-executive employee in fiscal
2001 and a separate error in the application of SFAS No.123R, related to the
cancellation of a grant to a non-executive employee in 2006.  The pre-tax compensation adjustment for these
two grants is approximately $1.0 million, which should have been recorded
within operating expenses over the period January 1, 2001 through June 30,
2006.

The unintentional accounting
errors arising from the items discussed above caused non-cash compensation
expense together with related employment tax expenses to be understated by a
cumulative amount of $1.3 million ($1.0 million net of income tax) over the
period January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2006. The Company has concluded that
the impact of these errors is not material to its historical consolidated
financial statements for any previously reported period. A correcting entry to
record the cumulative impact of these errors was recorded during the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2006. The Company also does not consider the adjustment
to be material to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The adjustment
increased other operating expenses by $1.3 million and reduced provision for
income taxes by $0.3 million, which resulted in a $1.0 million reduction in net
income. The correcting adjustment also had the effect of increasing non-current
deferred tax assets by $0.05 million and reducing additional paid-in capital by
$0.2 million at December 31, 2006.


The Company is evaluating
actions it may take with respect to outstanding options that were affected by
the errors above in relation to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and
any decision to reimburse or compensate employees for the potential inadvertent
taxation will be recorded as an expense in such future period.

14.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

Employees of the
Company may participate in the Hansen Natural Corporation 401(k) Plan, a
defined contribution plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code.  Participating employees
may contribute up to 15% of their pretax salary up to statutory limits.  The Company contributes 25% of the employee
contribution, up to 8% of each employee’s earnings, which vest 20% each year
for five years after the first anniversary date.  Matching contributions were $0.2 million, $0.2
million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

15.

Two directors and officers of the Company and their
families are principal owners of a company that provides promotional materials
to the Company. Expenses incurred with such company in connection with
promotional materials purchased during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company has
two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”), whose principal
products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products
comprise juice based and soda beverages. 
The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through
an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops,
markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Corporate and
unallocated amounts that do not relate to DSD or Warehouse segments
specifically have been allocated to “Corporate & Unallocated.” Rumba

TM

brand energy juice, which was previously
reported in the Warehouse segment, is now reported in the DSD segment. Hansen’s®
energy drinks, which were previously reported in the DSD segment, are now
reported in the Warehouse segment. For presentation purposes, the changes are
assumed to have commenced January 1, 2006 and are reflected as such in the
amounts for the year ended December 31, 2006. 
The comparable amounts for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, as previously reported, have been recast to reflect the above
reclassification.


The net revenues
derived from DSD and Warehouse segments and other financial information related
thereto for the year ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

The
reclassification of Rumba

TM

brand energy
juice, which was previously reported in the Warehouse division, to the DSD division
and the reclassification of Hansen’s® energy drinks, which were previously
reported in the DSD division, to the Warehouse division, resulted in an
increase in net sales of the Warehouse division and a decrease in net sales of
the DSD division of $7.1 million and $13.6 million for the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from amounts previously reported. The
reclassifications also resulted in an increase in contribution margin of the
Warehouse division and a decrease in contribution margin of the DSD division of
$4.0 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, from amounts previously reported.

Revenue is derived
from sales to external customers. 
Operating expenses that pertain to each segment are allocated to the
appropriate segment.

Corporate and unallocated expenses were $35.4
million for year ended December 31, 2006 and included $20.0 million of payroll
costs, of which $8.3 million was attributable to stock-based compensation
expense (see Note 12, “Stock-Based Compensation”), and $5.3 million
attributable to professional service expenses, including accounting and legal
costs.  Corporate and unallocated
expenses were $15.9 million for year ended December 31, 2005 and included $8.3

DISTRIBUTION
AGREEMENTS

On May 8, 2006, HBC entered into the Monster Beverages
Off-Premise Distribution Coordination Agreement and the Allied Products Distribution
Coordination Agreement (jointly, the “Off-Premise Agreements”) with
Anheuser-Busch, Inc., a Missouri corporation (“AB”).  Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select AB
Distributors will distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC’s
Monster Energy® and Lost® Energy™ brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, Rumba™
brand energy juice and Unbound Energy® brand energy drinks, as well as
additional products that may be agreed between the parties.

Pursuant to the AB
Distribution Agreements entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors,
non-refundable payments totaling $20.9 million were made to the Company by such
newly appointed AB Distributors for the costs of terminating the Company’s
prior distributors through December 31, 2006. Such receipts have been accounted
for as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2006 and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the
anticipated 20 year life of the respective AB Distribution Agreements.


As of December 31, 2006,
amounts totaling $3.3 million were paid to the Company by certain other AB
Distributors in anticipation of executing AB Distribution Agreements with the
Company. Such receipts have been accounted for as customer deposit liabilities
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006.

Through December 31, 2006,
the Company incurred termination costs amounting to $12.7 million in aggregate
to certain of its prior distributors. Such termination costs have been expensed
in full and are included in operating expenses for year ended December 31,
2006.  Certain amounts totaling $7.0
million included in such termination costs were not paid to our prior
distributors before the end of our fiscal year and are therefore included in
accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2006.

On February 8,
2007, HBC entered into an On-Premise Distribution Coordination Agreement (the “On-Premise
Agreement”) with AB.  Under the
On-Premise Agreement, AB will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution and
merchandising of Monster Energy® energy drinks to on-premise retailers
including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by HBC.
