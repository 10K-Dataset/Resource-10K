Investment Trust and our business and operations conducted through our directly
or indirectly owned subsidiaries.

GENERAL

We are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the
ownership, management, development and redevelopment of high quality retail and
mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2003, we owned or had an interest in
62 community and neighborhood shopping centers comprising approximately 13.5
million square feet, primarily located in densely populated and affluent
communities throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. In
addition, we owned 49 urban and retail mixed-use properties comprising over 2.7
million square feet and one apartment complex, primarily located in strategic
metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and California.
In total, our properties were 93.1% leased at December 31, 2003. We have paid
quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in
1962, and have increased our dividend rate for 36 consecutive years.

We operate our business on an asset management model, where small focused
teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets. We have divided our portfolio
of properties into three operating regions: the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and
West. Each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager, with
dedicated leasing, property management and financial staff and operates largely
autonomously with respect to day to day operating decisions.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1626 East Jefferson Street,
Rockville, Maryland 20852 and our telephone number is (301) 998-8100. Our Web
site address is

www.federalrealty.com

. The information contained on our Web
site is not a part of this report.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES

Our primary business objective is to own, manage, acquire and redevelop a
portfolio of commercial retail properties, with the dominant property type
being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers, that will:

•

provide increasing cash flow for quarterly distributions to shareholders;

•

protect investor capital;

•

provide potential for capital appreciation; and

•

generate higher internal growth than our peers.

Our traditional focus has been on grocery anchored community and
neighborhood shopping centers. Late in 1994, recognizing a trend of increased
consumer acceptance and retailer expansion to main streets, we expanded our
investment strategy to include “street retail” and “mixed-use” properties. The
mixed-use properties are typically centered around a retail component but may
also include office, residential and hotel components in established main
street shopping areas. In addition, from 1997 through 2001 we undertook the
ground-up development in urban areas of mixed-use projects that center around
the retail component. On

-4-


February 28, 2002, our Board of Trustees approved the adoption of a
business plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of
owning, managing, redeveloping and acquiring community and neighborhood
shopping centers anchored by grocery stores, drug stores or high volume, value
oriented retailers that provide consumer necessities. We will complete our
mixed-use projects in San Jose, California and Bethesda, Maryland, but will not
pursue any new, large-scale, ground-up development projects.

Operating Strategies

Our
core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize
rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining
a strong and
diverse base of tenants. Our properties are generally located in some of the
most densely populated and affluent areas of the country. In addition, because
of the in-fill nature of our locations, our centers generally face less
competition per capita than centers owned by our peers. These strong demographics help our
tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates, high
rental rates, and consistent rental rate growth, all of which has lead to increased
value of our portfolio. Our operating strategies also include:

•

maintaining a diversified tenant base, thereby limiting
exposure to any one tenant’s financial difficulties;

•

monitoring the credit mix of our tenant base to achieve a
balance of strong national and regional credit tenants with more
local specialty tenants;

•

minimizing overhead and operating costs;

•

monitoring the physical appearance of our properties and the
construction quality, condition and design of the buildings and
other improvements located on our properties to maximize our
ability to generate high rental and occupancy rates;

•

developing local and regional market expertise in order to
capitalize on market and retailing trends;

•

leveraging the contacts and experience of our management team
to build and maintain long-term relationships with tenants,
investors and financing sources;

•

increasing rental rates through the renewal or releasing of
expiring leases at higher rental rates and limiting vacancy and
down-time; and

•

providing exceptional customer service.

Investing Strategies

Our investment strategy calls for deploying capital at risk-adjusted rates
of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that
have potential for going-forward net income growth equal to, or in excess of,
that of our core portfolio of properties. Our investments primarily fall into
one of the following four categories:

•

renovating, expanding, reconfiguring and/or retenanting our
existing properties to take advantage of under-utilized land or
existing square footage to increase our internal growth rate;

•

renovating or expanding tenant spaces for tenants capable of
producing higher sales, and therefore, paying higher rents,
including expanding an existing tenant that is performing well but
is operating out of an old or otherwise inefficient store format;

•

acquiring community and neighborhood shopping centers,
located in densely populated or growing affluent areas where
barriers to entry for further development

-5-


are high, and that have possibilities for enhancing operating
performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and/or
retenanting; and

•

acquiring stable community and neighborhood shopping centers,
located in densely populated or growing affluent areas where
barriers to entry for further development are high, in partnership
with longer term investors who contribute a substantial portion of
the equity needed to acquire those properties.

Investment Criteria

When we evaluate potential redevelopment, retenanting, expansion and
acquisition opportunities, we consider such factors as:

•

the expected returns in relation to our cost of capital as
well as the anticipated risk we will face in achieving the expected
returns;

•

the anticipated growth rate of operating income generated by
the property;

•

the tenant mix at the property, tenant sales performance and
the creditworthiness of those tenants;

•

the geographic area in which the property is located,
including the population density and household incomes, as well as
the density and income trends in that geographic area;

•

competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property,
including competition for tenants and the ability to create
competing properties through redevelopment, new construction or
renovation;

•

access to and visibility of the property from and potential
for new, widened or realigned, roadways within the property’s trade
area, which may affect access and commuting and shopping patterns;

•

the level and success of our existing investments in the
market area;

•

the current market value of the land, buildings and other
improvements and the potential for increasing those market values; and

•

the physical condition of the land, buildings and other
improvements, including the structural and environmental condition.

Financing Strategies

Our financing strategies are designed to maintain a strong balance sheet
while maintaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing
activities in the most cost efficient way possible. Our financing strategies
include:

•

maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an
adequate pool of unencumbered properties;

•

actively managing our exposure to variable-rate debt;

•

utilizing the most advantageous long-term source of capital available
to us to finance redevelopment and acquisition opportunities, which
may include:

•

the sale of equity or debt securities through public
offerings or private placements,

•

the incurrence of indebtedness through secured or
unsecured borrowings,

•

the issuance of operating units in one of our “downREIT
partnerships,” which generally receive the same distributions as
our common shares and may be

-6-


convertible into our common shares, in exchange for a tax deferred
contribution of property, or

•

the use of joint venture arrangements;

•

taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance
existing debt, reduce interest costs and manage our debt maturity
schedule; and

•

selling properties that have limited growth potential or are
not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio and redeploying the
proceeds to redevelop, renovate, retenant and/or expand our existing
properties, acquire new properties or reduce debt.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2003, we had 283 full-time employees and 153 part-time
employees. None of the employees is represented by a collective bargaining
unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

TAX STATUS

We elected under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, which we refer to as the Code, to be taxed as a REIT under the Code
beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1962. As a REIT we are
generally not subject to federal income tax on REIT taxable income that we
distribute to our shareholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous
organizational and operational requirements, including the requirement to
distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income each year. We will be subject
to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (including any applicable
alternative minimum tax) at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a
REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less
than 100% of REIT taxable income. We will also not be permitted to qualify for
treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following
the year during which qualification is lost. Even if we qualify as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to certain state and local
income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our
undistributed REIT taxable income. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries
are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR PROPERTIES

We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local
environmental, health, safety and similar laws, including:

•

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA;

•

the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act;

•

the Federal Clean Water Act;

•

the Federal Clean Air Act;

•

the Toxic Substances Control Act;

•

the Occupational Safety & Health Act; and

•

the Americans with Disabilities Act.

-7-


The application of these laws to a specific property that we own will be
dependent on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the former
uses of the property, the building materials used at each property and the
physical layout of each property. Under certain environmental laws,
principally CERCLA, we, as the owner or operator of our current properties or
properties we previously owned, may be required to investigate and clean up
certain hazardous or toxic substances, asbestos-containing materials, or
petroleum product releases at the property. We may also be held liable to a
governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation
and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination, whether or
not we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. In addition, some
environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the
government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the
contamination. As the owner or operator of real estate, we also may be liable
under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from
environmental contamination emanating from the real estate. Such costs or
liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. The presence
of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect
our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as
collateral.

Our compliance with existing environmental, health, safety and similar
laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an
impact in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to
incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at
properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot
predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on our current
properties or on properties that we may acquire in the future. We have no
current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance
with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and we carry environmental
insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our
properties.

COMPETITION

Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us
for tenants and properties to acquire. Some of these
competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do, although no
single competitor or group of competitors in any of the markets where our
properties are located is believed to be dominant in that market. This
competition may:

•

reduce the number of properties available for acquisition;

•

increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;

•

reduce rents payable to us;

•

interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;

•

lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and

•

adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.

Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet
stores, discount shopping clubs, and other forms of marketing of goods and
services, such as direct mail, internet marketing and telemarketing. This
competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.

Item 2. Properties

General

As of December 31, 2003, we owned or had an interest in 62 community and
neighborhood shopping centers comprising approximately 13.5 million square
feet, primarily located in densely populated and affluent communities
throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. In addition, we owned
49 urban and retail mixed-use properties comprising over 2.7 million square
feet and one apartment complex, primarily located in strategic metropolitan
markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and California. No single
property accounted for over 10% of our 2003 total revenue or net income. We
believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general
liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by
reputable companies, with commercially reasonable exclusions, deductibles and
limits.

We operate our business on an asset management model, where small, focused
teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets. We have divided our portfolio
of properties into three operating regions: the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and
West. Each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager, with
dedicated leasing, property management and financial staff, and operates
largely autonomously with respect to day to day operating decisions.

Tenant Diversification

As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 2,200 tenants, ranging from
sole proprietors to major national retailers. No one tenant or affiliated
group of tenants accounted for more than 2.3% of our annualized base rent as of
December 31, 2003. As a result of our tenant diversification, we believe our
exposure to recent and future bankruptcy filings in the retail sector has not
been and will not be significant.

Leases, Lease Terms and Lease Expirations

Our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured
to include the monthly payment in advance of minimum rents with periodic
increases, percentage rents based on our tenants’ gross sales volumes and
reimbursement of a majority of on-site operating expenses and real estate
taxes. These features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs caused
by inflation and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales.

Leases on apartments are generally for a period of one year or less and,
in 2003, represented approximately 2.6% of total revenues. Commercial property
leases generally range from 3 to 10 years; however certain leases with anchor
tenants may be longer. Many of the leases contain provisions allowing the
tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration at rates
which often include fixed rent increases, consumer price index adjustments or
other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent.

The following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our
commercial leases in place as of December 31, 2003 for each of the 10
years beginning with 2004, assuming that none of the tenants exercise their
future renewal options. Annualized base rents reflect in-place contractual
rents as of December 31, 2003.

to certain matters relating to the operation of the properties by the tenant,
and (2) where appropriate, due to certain matters relating to the ownership of
the properties prior to their acquisition by us.

Our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income
taxes as long as we maintain our REIT status and distribute to shareholders at
least 100% of our REIT taxable income. Under the Code, REITs are subject to
numerous organizational and operational

-19-


requirements, including the requirement
to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income. State income taxes are not
material to our operations or cash flows.

Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Trustees
and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders,
financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements
under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Board of
Trustees deems relevant. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders
continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our annual dividend
rate for 36 consecutive years.

Our total annual dividends paid per share for 2003 and 2002 were $1.945
per share and $1.925 per share, respectively. The annual dividend amounts are
different from total distributions calculated for tax purposes. Distributions to the extent of
our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax
purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend
income. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and
profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in
such shareholder’s shares, to the extent thereof, and thereafter as taxable
capital gain. Distributions that are treated as a reduction of the
shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of deferring taxation
until the sale of the shareholder’s shares. No assurances can be given
regarding what portion, if any, of distributions in 2004 or subsequent years
will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. During a
year in which a REIT earns a net long-term capital gain, the REIT can elect
under Code Sec. 857(b)(3) to designate a portion of dividends paid to
shareholders as capital gain dividends. If this election is made, then the
capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as long-term capital
gains. During 2003, a portion of the distributions was designated as a capital

Shares paid distributions at a rate of $1.9875 per share per annum and were
redeemed in full in June 2003. We do not believe that the preferential rights
available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants
contained in our debt agreements will have an adverse effect on our ability to
pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to
distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.

2)

We have historically reported our funds from operations (“FFO”) in
addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating
activities. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real
estate companies’ operating performance. The National

-21-


Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as
follows: income available for common shareholders before depreciation and
amortization of real estate assets and before extraordinary items less
gains on sale of real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure
of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize that
the value of income-producing real estate historically has not
depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO does not
represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP
(which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions
and other events in the determination of net income); should not be
considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our
performance; and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure
of liquidity or ability to pay dividends. We consider FFO a meaningful,
additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes
the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as
a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly
titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to
possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by
such REITs. For a reconciliation of net income available for common
shareholders to FFO, please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — 
Funds From Operations.”

Includes an $8.5 million restructuring charge incurred in the first
quarter of 2002 and a $13.8 million restructuring charge incurred in
the fourth quarter of 2002. Excluding these charges, Funds from
Operations in 2002 would have been $112.8 million. Also includes
approximately $8.0 million of insurance proceeds in 2003 as well as a
charge of $3.4 million related to the redemption of preferred shares.
Excluding these items, funds from operations in 2003 would have been
$119.7 million

4)

Earnings consist of income before gain (loss) on sale of real
estate and fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest on
borrowed funds (including capitalized interest), amortization of debt
discount and expense and the portion of rent expense representing an
interest factor. Preferred share dividends consist of dividends paid
on our outstanding Series A preferred shares and Series B preferred
shares. Our Series A preferred shares were redeemed in full in June
2003.

5)

EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that means net income or loss plus
interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization; adjusted
for gain or loss on sale of assets, impairment provisions, provision
for loss on equity securities and other nonrecurring expenses. EBITDA
is presented because it provides useful information regarding our
ability to service debt, although EBITDA should not be considered an
alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations
as determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA as presented may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other REITs.

Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements or those incorporated into this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also make no promise to update any of the
forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the risks and the risk
factors incorporated herein by reference from our Form 8-K filed on
March 11, 2004 before making any investment in us.

Overview

We are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the
ownership, management, development and redevelopment of high quality retail and
mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2003, we owned or had an interest in
62 community and neighborhood shopping centers comprising approximately 13.5
million square feet, primarily located in densely

-23-


populated and affluent communities throughout the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic United States. In addition, we owned 49 urban and retail
mixed-use properties comprising over 2.7 million square feet and one apartment
complex, primarily located in strategic metropolitan markets in the Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic regions and California. In total, our properties were 93.1%
leased at December 31, 2003 and 94.7% leased at December 31, 2002.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which we refer
to as GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in
certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses.
These estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after
considering past and current events and economic conditions. In addition,
information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes
internally generated financial and operating information, external market
information when available, and when necessary, information obtained from
consultations with third party experts. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it
requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate
was made, and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a
material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

The most significant accounting policies which involve the use of
estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result
in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Base rents are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases, net
of valuation adjustments, based on management’s assessment of credit,
collection and other business risk. We make estimates of the collectibility of
our accounts receivable related to base rents, including receivables from
recording rent on a straight-line basis, expense reimbursements and other
revenue or income taking into account payment history, industry trends and the
period of recovery. In doing so, we generally reserve for straight-line rents
due to be collected beyond ten years because of uncertainty of collection. In some
cases the ultimate collectibility of these claims extends beyond one year.
These estimates have a direct impact on our net income. Historically we have
recognized bad debt expense between 1.0% and 1.5% of rental income. If we were
to have experienced an increase in bad debt of 0.5% of rental income in 2003,
our net income would have been reduced by approximately $1.6 million.

Real Estate

The nature of our business as an owner, re-developer and operator of
retail shopping centers means that we are very capital intensive. Depreciation
and maintenance of our shopping centers and mixed-use properties constitutes a
substantial cost for the Trust as well as the industry as a whole. The Trust
capitalizes real estate investments and depreciates it in accordance with GAAP
and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the
assets’ physical and economic useful lives. The cost of our real estate
investments

-24-


less salvage value, if any, is charged to depreciation expense
over the estimated life of the asset using straight-line rates for financial
statement purposes. We periodically review the lives of our assets and
implement changes, as necessary, to the depreciation rates. These reviews take
into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets, the
repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets, the cost of
redevelopments which may extend the useful lives of our assets and general
economic and real estate factors. A newly developed neighborhood shopping
center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years,
but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings, estimating
the useful lives of assets that are long-lived as well as their salvage value
requires significant management judgment. Accordingly, we believe that the
estimates we make to determine our depreciation expense for accounting purposes
are critical.

Land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method with useful lives
ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements. Maintenance and
repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant work and other
major improvements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are
capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful
life of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Minor improvements,
furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful
lives ranging from three to 15 years. Certain external and internal
costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real
estate, including applicable salaries and the related direct costs, are
capitalized. The capitalized costs associated with developments,
redevelopments and leasing are depreciated or amortized over the life of the
improvement and lease, respectively. Unamortized leasing costs are charged to
operations if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease.
Undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant
vacates and the tenant work is replaced.

When applicable as lessee, we classify our leases of land and building as
operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” We are
required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term, the
estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in
applying the provisions of SFAS No. 13. These estimates determine whether or
not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an
asset.

We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of
our real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to
reflect on an annual basis. These assessments have a direct impact on net
income. Certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates
and assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen competition or changes in
customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding
our ability to realize the return on investment in the property and therefore
reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation
expense to charge against both the current and future revenues. We will
continue to periodically review the lives of assets and any decrease in asset
lives could have the effect of increasing depreciation expense while any analysis
indicating that lives are longer than we have assumed could have the effect of
decreasing depreciation expense. In order to determine the impact on
depreciation expense of a different average life of our real estate assets
taken as a whole, we used 25 years, which is the approximate average life of
all assets being depreciated at the end of 2003. If the estimated useful lives
of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year, the consolidated
depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately $3.0 million. If
the estimated useful lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by
one year, the consolidated depreciation expense would have increased by
approximately $3.0 million.

-25-


Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as
part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service.
Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and
expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready
for its intended use. Generally, rental property is considered substantially
complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements,
but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity. We
make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and
these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized
costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for
capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby
decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period.

Long-Lived Assets

There are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the
consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will emerge over
long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets,
including our properties which have been acquired or developed. Management
must evaluate properties for possible impairment of value and, for those
properties where impairment may be indicated, make estimates of future cash
flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and
development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and
rental rates over very long periods. Because our properties typically have a
very long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of
book value requires significant management judgment.

In August 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (effective for us on January 1,
2002). SFAS No. 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or
newly-acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to
include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can
be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the
rest of the entity. As a result, the sale of a property, or the classification
of a property as held for sale, requires us to report the results of that
property as “discontinued operations.”

We are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in
determining whether there is an impairment of an asset. Actual results could
be significantly different from the estimates. These estimates have a direct
impact on net income, because recording an impairment charge results in a
negative adjustment to net income.

Contingencies

We are sometimes involved in lawsuits and environmental matters arising in
the ordinary course of business. Management makes assumptions and estimates
concerning the amount and likelihood of loss relating to these matters. These
estimates and assumptions have a direct impact on net income.

-26-


Recent Developments

In January 2004, we issued $75 million of fixed rate notes which mature in
February 2011 and bear interest at 4.50%. The proceeds of this note offering
were used to pay down our revolving credit facility.

Also in January 2004, we purchased an interest rate swap on our $150
million term note which bears interest at LIBOR plus 95 basis-points and is due
to mature in October 2008. The swap has locked in the LIBOR portion of the
interest rate at 2.401% through October 2006.

We
paid off our 6.74% Medium Term Notes on their due date of March 10,
2004 for their full principal balance of $39.5 million.

2003 Property Acquisitions and Dispositions

Acquisitions

On March 21,
    2003, a partnership in which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general
    partner, purchased the 214,000 square foot South Valley Shopping Center in
    Alexandria, Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $13.7 million
    in cash. All of the purchase price has been allocated to real estate assets
    except for approximately $125,000 which has been allocated to prepaid and
    other assets associated with the net fair value assigned to above-market leases
    assumed and $332,000 which has been allocated to other liabilities associated
    with the net fair value assigned to below-market leases assumed.

On March 31,
    2003, the same partnership acquired the leasehold interest, which extends
    through December 31, 2077, in the 257,000 square foot Mount Vernon Plaza
    in Alexandria, Virginia, for aggregate consideration of approximately $17.5 million
    in the form of approximately $700,000 of cash, 120,000 partnership units valued
    at $3.5 million and the assumption of a $13.3 million mortgage. All of
    the purchase price has been allocated to real estate assets except for approximately
    $756,000 which has been allocated to prepaid and other assets associated with
    the net fair value assigned to above-market leases assumed and $1.75 million
    which has been allocated to other liabilities
associated with the net fair value assigned to the assumed leases at the property
    assigned.

On October 14,
    2003, the Trust acquired the leasehold interest, which extends through September 30,
    2028, in the 321,000 square foot Mercer Mall in Lawrenceville, New Jersey
    for $10.5 million paid out of proceeds from dispositions and from borrowings
    under our credit facility. The master lease includes a fixed purchase price
    option for $55 million in 2023. If we fail to exercise our purchase option,
    the owner of Mercer Mall has a put option which would require us to purchase
    Mercer Mall for $60 million in 2025. All of the purchase price has been
    allocated to real estate assets except for approximately $736,000 allocated
    to prepaid and other assets associated with the net fair value assigned to
    above-market leases assumed, and $2.4 million allocated to other liabilities
    associated with the net fair value assigned to below-market leases assumed.

On October 31,
    2003, FR Plaza del Mercado, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust, purchased
    the 96,000 square foot Plaza del Mercado shopping center located in Silver
    Spring, Maryland for a purchase price of approximately $20 million in
    cash. All of the purchase price has been allocated to real estate assets except
    for approximately $929,000 fair value assigned to above-market
leases assumed
    and $962,000 allocated to other liabilities associated with the net fair value
    assigned to below-market leases assumed.

On December 4,
    2003, FR Mercer Mall, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust, purchased
    a 40,000 square foot out-parcel of Mercer Mall in Lawrenceville, New Jersey
    for a purchase price of approximately $6.5 million including the assumption.
    All of the purchase price has been allocated to real estate assets except
    for approximately $15,000 which has been allocated to prepaid and other assets
    associated with the net fair value assigned to above-market lease assumed.

Dispositions

For the year ended December 31, 2003, aggregate cash proceeds from
dispositions were $46.0 million. Costs of dispositions were approximately $2.1
million which resulted in net proceeds from sale of real estate for 2003 being
$43.9 million compared to net proceeds from sale of real estate in 2002 of
$62.5 million.

On June 16, 2003 we sold the street retail property located at 4929
Bethesda Avenue in Bethesda, Maryland for approximately $1.5 million resulting
in a gain of $551,000. Net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under our
credit facility.

In the third quarter of 2003,
we sold three retail properties and one
undeveloped parcel of land for gross cash proceeds of $20.8 million. The
properties sold were Coolidge Corner in Brookline, Massachusetts (13,000 retail
square feet), Tanasbourne in Washington County, Oregon (undeveloped land), 4925
Bethesda Avenue in Bethesda, Maryland (3,400 square feet) and 2106 Central
Avenue in Evanston, Illinois (19,000 square feet). The combined gain on the
dispositions was $7.2 million. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings
under our credit facility or held in cash to be used to fund acquisitions which
took place in October 2003 (see “Acquisitions” above).

On October 31, 2003, we sold a 15,000 square foot street retail asset
located at 234 Greenwich Avenue in Greenwich, Connecticut for approximately
$8.0 million. As a result of this sale, the Trust recorded a gain of
approximately $4.5 million.

On December 18, 2003, we sold four street retail properties, totaling
62,000 square feet, located in West Hartford, Connecticut. The properties were
sold for approximately $15.7 million and resulted in a gain of approximately
$7.9 million.

During the first quarter of 2003 an action was filed by a local
governmental authority to condemn a shopping center in Rockville, Maryland,
owned by one of our partnerships to facilitate the authority’s redevelopment of
its town center. The shopping center has a cost basis of $10.5 million and
contributes less than 1% to rental income. We have agreed on a condemnation
value of $14.3 million, subject to certain terms, with the governmental
authority and anticipate closing of this transaction in mid-2004. Because the
anticipated condemnation proceeds are in excess of our carrying value, we have
not recorded any impairment in value of the property.

-28-


2003 Financing Developments

On February 11, 2003, the $24.4 million Woodmont East construction loan
and the $17.0 million Friendship Center mortgage were paid off through
borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

On May 14, 2003, we issued 3.2 million common shares at $30.457 per share
($31.48 gross, before an aggregate 3.25% underwriters discount and selling
concession), netting $98.4 million in cash proceeds.

On
June 13, 2003, we redeemed our $100 million 7.95% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares using the proceeds from the May 14, 2003 common
stock offering and additional borrowings under our line of credit.

On
June 23, 2003, we redeemed and paid in full our
$75 million, 5 ¼%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures originally due to mature on October 28,
2003, through borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

On October 8, 2003, we closed on a new $550 million unsecured credit
facility which replaced our $300 million revolving credit facility and $125
million term loan, both of which were due to mature on December 19, 2003. The
new credit facility consists of a $150 million five-year term loan, a $100
million three-year term loan, and a $300 million three-year revolving credit
facility, with a one-year extension option. The term loans bear interest at
LIBOR plus 95 basis points, while the revolving facility bears interest at
LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The spread over LIBOR is subject to
adjustment based on our credit rating. Covenants under the new credit facility are
substantially the same type as were required under the previous facility.
Concurrent with the replacement of our $125 million term loan with the new
credit facility, we unwound the related interest rate swaps which were due to
expire on December 19, 2003 at of cost of approximately $1.1 million. In
January 2004, to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our $150 million term
loan issued in October 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap, which fixed
the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.401% through October 2006. The
interest rate on the term loan as of December 31, 2003 was LIBOR plus 95 basis
points. Subsequent to entering into the swap, the
interest rate was fixed at 3.351% (2.401% plus 0.95%) on notional
amounts totaling $150 million.

A $5.9 million loan receivable, which currently bears interest at 7.88%
and is secured by an office building in San Francisco, California, was due
February 28, 2003 but was not repaid on the due date. We are currently
negotiating with the borrower to extend the loan until March 31, 2005. When
the loan modification is complete, the interest rate on the note will decrease
to 6% retroactive to July 1, 2003. Interest on the loan is current through
December 31, 2003 and based in part on the value of the
underlying collateral, we believe that the loan is collectible, and as such, no reserve has
been established at this time.

Santana Row

In 2003, our single largest development capital need was the completion of
Phase I and Phase II of Santana Row, a multi-phase, mixed-use project built on
42 acres in San Jose, California in the heart of Silicon Valley. The project
consists of residential, retail and hotel components, creating a community with
the feel of an urban district.

Phase I of the project includes eight buildings which contain
approximately 444,000 square feet of retail space, 255 residential units, a 213
room hotel and the supporting infrastructure. The first building, containing
40,000 square feet and leased to Crate & Barrel opened on June 27,
2002. Six of the remaining seven buildings, consisting of approximately
317,000 square feet of retail space, opened on November 7, 2002. The remaining
building, “Building Seven,” contained approximately 87,000 square feet of
retail space, approximately 1,000 parking spaces and 246 residential units
until a fire on August 19, 2002, prior to its scheduled opening. The fire in
August 2002 destroyed all but 11 of the 246 residential units and damaged the
retail units and a parking structure resulting in a delay of the

-29-


opening of the retail units from September 2002 until February 2003. We
estimate the total cost of Phase I to be approximately $443 million, net of
related insurance proceeds.

In December 2003, we reached final settlement with our insurance company
regarding the Santana Row fire claim and received a final payment of $26.9
million bringing the total settlement to $129.0 million. In total, all of the
proceeds except approximately $11 million has been accounted for as a reduction
in the cost basis of the property or reimbursement of costs to clean-up and
restore damaged property or reimbursements to third parties. The remaining $11 million has been accounted for as
a reimbursement of lost rents of which $8 million was recognized in 2003 as
part of rental income and the remainder will be recognized as rental income in
2004. A gain of $200,000 was recognized in the second quarter of 2003 to
account for that portion of the insurance proceeds received in excess of costs
of the constructed assets.

On February 7, 2003, we announced plans for Phase II of Santana Row, which
includes approximately 84,000 square feet of retail space on two pad sites and
275 additional parking spaces. The Phase II retail space was opened and
operating prior to year-end 2003 with total development costs of approximately
$26 million. The two primary tenants of Phase II, The Container Store and Best
Buy, opened in the fourth quarter of 2003.

In November 2003, we announced the planned development of 96 townhomes and
160 flats on the Building 7 podium to replace the units that were destroyed in
the August 2002 fire. Construction began in late 2003 and the first units are
expected to be available in early 2005 with the balance delivered later in that
year. The Trust will invest nearly $60 million of incremental capital to
complete the residential development.

The success of Santana Row will depend on many factors which cannot be
assured and are not entirely within our control. These factors include among
others, the demand for retail and residential space, the cost of operations,
including utilities and insurance, the availability and cost of capital and the
general economy, particularly in and around Silicon Valley.

Results of Operations

Same Center

Throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a “same
center” basis. Information provided on a same center basis is provided for only
those properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods
being compared and includes properties which were redeveloped or expanded
during the periods being compared. Properties purchased or sold and properties
under development at any time during the periods being compared are excluded.

For purposes of the following discussion of our results of operations on a
same center basis for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2002, we exclude the four shopping centers acquired during
2003 and 2002 (Mount Vernon Plaza, South Valley Shopping Center, Plaza del
Mercado and Mercer Mall) as well as the dispositions (two buildings in
Bethesda, Maryland, an undeveloped parcel in Washington County, Oregon, one building in
Evanston, Illinois, one building in Greenwich, Connecticut, one
property in Brookline, Massachusetts, and four buildings in West Hartford, Connecticut). We also
exclude the six properties sold in 2002 (one property in Greenwich,
Connecticut; two properties in Westport,

-30-


Connecticut; one property in Westfield, New Jersey; one property in
Hollywood, California; and one property in Portland, Oregon) and properties
under development in 2003 or 2002, including two of our street retail
properties, Santana Row in San Jose, California and Pentagon Row in Arlington,
Virginia.

Same center information for the year ended December 31, 2002 excludes the six
properties sold in 2002, the Williamsburg Shopping Center in Williamsburg,
Virginia, 101 E. Oak Street in Chicago, Illinois and 70/10 Austin Street in
Forest Hills, New York which were sold in 2001, Friendship Center in
Washington, D.C. which was purchased on September 21, 2001, the office building
located at 580 Market Street in San Francisco, California which was exchanged
for the minority partner’s interest in Santana Row and properties under
development in 2001 and 2002, including Pentagon Row in Arlington, Virginia and
Santana Row in San Jose, California.

REVENUES

Total revenues in 2003 were $357.9 million which represents an increase of
$42.2 million or 13.4% over total revenues of $315.6 million in 2002. The
primary drivers of this growth are acquisitions, an increase in same center revenues
from higher rent on tenant rollovers as detailed below and income of approximately $8.0 million resulting from the portion of
the settlement of our insurance claims for the August 2002 fire at Santana Row
that related to lost rent. In addition, we experienced increased cost
recoveries related to higher operating costs.

The
percentage leased at our shopping centers declined to 93.1% at December 31, 2003
compared to 94.7% at year end 2002 due to acquisitions of centers with lower
occupancy rates and the bankruptcies of several principal tenants (including
K-mart and Today’s Man) as well as an

-31-


increase in redevelopment activity which results in leaseable space being
taken out of service for more extended periods.

Rental income.

Rental income consists primarily of minimum rent,
percentage rent and cost recoveries from tenants of common area maintenance and
real estate taxes. Rental income increased $39.7 million, or 13.5% , in 2003
versus 2002 due largely to the following:

•

an increase of approximately $22.0 million due to properties
acquired in 2003 and from Santana Row, which was considered to be under
development,

•

approximately $8.0 million from the Santana Row fire insurance
settlement, and

•

on a same center basis, an increase of over $8.0 million, or
approximately 3.0%, due mainly to increased minimum rents associated
with tenant rollovers and developments, but also due to increased real
estate tax recoveries.

Other Property Income.

Other property income increased $2.3 million, or
15.1%, to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $15.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in other property
income are items, which although recurring, tend to fluctuate more than rental
income from period to period, such as utility reimbursements, lease termination
fees and temporary tenant income. The increase in other property income in
2003 is primarily the result of higher utility reimbursements at Santana Row as
the property has come on line and higher temporary tenant income partly offset
by lower lease termination fees.

Interest and Other Income.

Interest and other income consisted primarily
of interest earned on mortgage notes receivable and overnight cash investments.
In 2002, there was also income on tax-deferred exchange escrow deposits, as
well as a provision for estimated losses related to various unconsolidated
restaurant joint ventures at Santana Row. Interest and other income remained
relatively flat from 2002 to 2003 as the reduced losses related to the
restaurant joint ventures were offset by reduced interest income on the
tax-deferred exchange escrow accounts and other interest income.

EXPENSES

Total property operating expenses were $118.0 million, or an increase of
$14.4 million when compared to $103.7 million in 2002. The total increase in
expenses is due almost entirely to higher real estate taxes, increased
maintenance costs related to snow removal in 2003 and the impact of
acquisitions and developments as detailed below.

Rental
Expense.

Rental expense increased $10.5 million, or 14.3%, to
$83.4 million in 2003 from $73.0 million in 2002. Of this increase:

•

rental expenses at centers acquired and developed during 2003
(including Santana Row) were $8.3 million;

•

snow removal costs increased approximately $3.8 million in the first quarter of
2003; and

•

other maintenance and rental expenses, on a same center
basis, were reduced approximately $1.7 million.

Property expense reductions related to disposed properties were not
significant.

As a result of these changes in rental expenses, rental income and other
property income, rental expense as a percentage of rental income plus other
property income increased slightly

-32-


from 23.5% in 2002 to 23.7% in 2003. We refer to rental income plus other
property income as “property income”.

Real Estate Taxes.

Real estate tax expense rose 12.7% in 2003 to $34.6
million compared to $30.7 million in 2002. The increase in 2003 is due largely
to higher tax assessments for our properties in the East Coast segment as well
as increased assessments of $1.8 million related to acquired and developed
properties, including Santana Row which was brought into service starting in
late 2002.

Property Operating Income.

Property operating income was $239.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $27.9 million compared to
$212.0 million in 2002. Of this amount approximately $8.0 million relates to
the Santana Row fire insurance proceeds attributable to rental income lost as a
result of the fire. Excluding these proceeds, property operating income rose
$19.9 million during 2003 due primarily to:

•

earnings growth at Santana Row which has been phased into service,

•

same center earnings increases, and

•

earnings resulting from our acquisitions.

Same center property operating income rose 2.7% or almost $5.7 million in
2003 due to increased rental income associated with tenant rollovers and higher
real estate tax recoveries and reduced property administrative expenses partly offset by
property expenses which rose higher than the related recoveries, particularly
the snow removal costs.

Interest Expense

. Interest expense rose $10.2 million, or 15.6%, to $75.2
million in 2003. This substantial rise is almost entirely due to lower
capitalization of interest and therefore higher interest expense as
most of our property under development, particularly at Santana Row, was placed into service. Gross interest expense
in 2003 was $88.7 million versus $88.6 million in 2002. Capitalized interest
amounted to $13.5 million and $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Administrative Expense.

Administrative expenses decreased by $2.0 million
during 2003, or 14.3% to $11.8 million compared to $13.8 million in 2002. This
$2.0 million decrease resulted primarily from payroll and related benefits
savings resulting from the management restructuring which began in February
2002. In addition, we experienced savings in legal costs and costs to support
and maintain our information systems. These savings were largely offset by
increased expensing of costs which had previously had been
capitalized related to personnel involved in the
development of Santana Row. In 2004, we expect administrative expenses to rise to those levels seen in 2002
due to higher costs of personnel and related expenditures.

Restructuring Expense.

The restructuring expenses incurred in 2002
related to our adoption of a new business and management succession plan
resulting in a charge of $8.5 million, all of which was expended in 2002. In
December 2002, we recorded a charge of $13.8 million as a result of an
accelerated executive transition plan of which $12.7 million was expended in
2003, $0.3 million was reversed and $0.8 million remains to be expended as of
December 31, 2003.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense.

Expenses attributable to
depreciation and amortization rose $11.3 million to $75.1 million in 2003 from
$63.8 million in 2002, an increase of 17.7%. The increase is due to
depreciation on properties which were acquired in 2003 as well as depreciation
of Santana Row which started opening in late 2002, and Pentagon Row, which came
fully into service during 2002.

-33-


OTHER

Minority Interests

. The increase in minority interests of $0.6 million in
income to minority interest from $4.1 million in 2002 to $4.7 million in 2003
is the result of increased earnings as well as an increase in the number of
operating partnership units held by minority investors. Units which were
issued in connection with our acquisition of Mount Vernon Shopping Center were
partially offset by a decrease in units outstanding as a results of redemptions
during the year.

Operating Income from Discontinued Operations.

Operating income from
discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that
have been disposed of which, under SFAS No. 144, are required to be reported
separately from results of ongoing operations. The reported operating income
of $1.4 million and $2.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, represent the
operating income for the period during which we owned the ten properties sold in
2003 and the six properties sold in 2002.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate Net of Loss on Abandoned Developments Held for
Sale.

The gain on sale of real estate in 2003 was $20.1 million for the
disposal of properties as outlined above. None of the properties sold in 2003
resulted in a loss. The gain in 2002 of $9.5 million is the result of the
sale of six properties partly offset by the recognition of a $9.7 million
impairment loss associated with our change in business plan in that year.

REVENUES

Total revenues increased $26.1 million, or 9.0%, to $315.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $289.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. The primary components of the increase in total revenues
are discussed below.

Rental Income.

Rental income consists of minimum rent, percentage rent
and cost recoveries for common area maintenance and real estate taxes. The
increase in rental income of $25.7 million, or 9.6%, for the year ended
December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, is
attributable to:

•

an increase of $15.4 million, or 5.7%, on a same center basis
due primarily to the increased rental rates at redeveloped and
retenanted centers, as well as increased rental rates associated
with lease rollovers, an increase in recovery income from a
refinement of our recovery accrual processes, and higher cost
recoveries as a result of increased rental expenses and real estate
tax expenses; and

•

an increase of $8.1 million in rental income attributable to
the properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2001 and properties
under development in 2001 and 2002 which phased into service during
2001 and 2002, specifically Santana Row and Pentagon Row. These
increases were offset by properties sold in 2001.

Other Property Income.

Other property income includes items, which
although recurring, tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to
period, such as utility reimbursements, lease termination fees and temporary
tenant income. The increase in other property income of $1.8 million, or 12.8%,
for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December
31, 2001, is attributable to:

•

increases of $1.3 million in parking income, utility
reimbursements and lease termination fees at Pentagon Row, which
began phasing into service in the second quarter of 2001, Santana
Row, which began phasing into service in the fourth quarter of 2002
and Friendship Center which was purchased in the third quarter of
2001; partially offset by

•

a one-time $800,000 perpetual easement payment from a
residential developer that has commenced development on an adjacent
site at the Pentagon Row project; and

•

a same center decrease of approximately $500,000 due to lower lease termination fees and parking income from
properties owned and operated in both periods.

Interest and Other Income.

Interest and other income includes interest
earned on mortgage notes receivable, overnight cash investments, including
tax-deferred exchange escrow deposits, as well as a provision for estimated
losses related to various unconsolidated restaurant joint ventures at Santana
Row. The decrease in interest and other income of $1.4 million, or 21.8% for
the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31,
2001, is attributable to a write down associated with the estimated impairment
of $1.3 million in these joint ventures which represented our best estimate of
the diminution of value based upon the then current economic climate surrounding
these joint ventures.

-35-


EXPENSES

Total
property operating expenses increased $14.4 million to $103.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $89.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. The primary components of the increase in total expenses
are discussed below.

Rental Expense

. The increase in rental expense of $11.4 million, or
18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2001, is attributable to:

•

an increase of $9.1 million in non-capitalized operating,
leasing and marketing costs associated with our development
projects, primarily operating, pre-opening and marketing expenses at
our Santana Row project, as well as increased costs reflecting a
full year of operating activity at the Pentagon Row project; and

•

an increase of $1.8 million, or 3.1%, on a same center basis
due primarily to increased maintenance, insurance and utility costs,
offset by lower bad debt and property management costs.

Rental expense as a percentage of rental income and other property income,
which we refer to as property income, increased slightly from 21.8% in 2001 to
23.5% in 2002 due primarily to increased marketing and pre-opening expenses at
Santana Row. Same center rental expense, excluding the effect of property
redevelopments and expansions, as a percentage of property income decreased
slightly from 20.0% in 2001 to 19.6% in 2002 and overall for the year ended
December 31, 2002 increased 2.2% from 2001.

Real Estate Taxes

. The increase in real estate taxes of $3.0 million, or
11.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2001, is attributable to the impact of taxes at Santana Row which
started coming into service in 2002, the impact of other acquired and developed
properties and a general increase in tax assessments. On a same center basis,
real estate taxes increased 7.0% due primarily to increased taxes on recently
redeveloped properties and overall increases in tax assessments at various
projects, principally Woodmont East, Fresh Meadows, Garden Market and Mid-Pike.
Same center real estate taxes, excluding the effect of property redevelopments
and expansions, for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 6.1% from 2001.

Property Operating Income

. As a result of the changes and variances
explained above, property operating income, total income less rental expenses
and real estate taxes, increased $11.6 million, or 5.8%, to $212.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $200.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001.

Interest Expense

. In 2002, we incurred interest of $88.6 million, of
which $23.5 million was capitalized yielding interest expense of $65.1 million,
as compared to interest incurred of $87.1 million in 2001, of which $17.8 million was
capitalized yielding interest expense of $69.3 million. The decrease in
interest expense of $4.2 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31,
2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, is attributable to:

-36-


•

increased capitalized interest at the Santana Row project
which was under construction for the majority of 2002 and began to
be phased into service beginning with the first tenant opening in
June 2002; and

•

a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate on our debt
from 7.6% in 2001 to 7.4% in 2002, primarily as a result of
decreasing interest rates on our variable rate debt.

Administrative Expense.

The decrease in administrative expense of $0.5
million, or 3.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2001, is mostly attributable to lower payroll costs in 2002
as a result of our corporate restructuring. As a result, administrative
expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 4.8% in the year ended
December 31, 2001 to 4.3% in the year ended December 31, 2002.

Restructuring Charge

. On February 28, 2002, we adopted a new business
plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of acquiring
and redeveloping community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored
by supermarkets, drug stores, or high volume, value oriented retailers that
provide consumer necessities. Concurrent with the adoption of the business
plan, we adopted a management succession plan and restructured our management
team. In connection with these plans, we recorded a charge of $18.2 million.
This charge included a reserve for a restructuring charge of $8.5 million made
up of $6.9 million of severance and other compensation costs for several of our
senior officers related to the management restructuring, as well as the
write-off of $1.6 million of our development costs. All charges against this
February 2002 reserve, totaling $8.5 million, were expended during 2002.

In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a charge of $13.8
million as a result of the accelerated executive transition whereby Donald C.
Wood, the Trust’s President and Chief Operating Officer, replaced Steven
Guttman as Chief Executive Officer of the Trust. The fourth quarter charge
includes an accrual of $7.9 million at December 31, 2002 for payments and
benefits due to Mr. Guttman pursuant to his contractual arrangements with us
and for other transition related costs. No cash payments were made against this
charge in 2002 and the majority of the accrual was expended in 2003.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

. The increase in depreciation and
amortization expense of $5.5 million, or 9.5%, for the year ended December 31,
2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 reflects the impact of
recent new developments, tenant improvements and property redevelopments which
were placed into service throughout 2001 and 2002.

OTHER

Minority Interests.

The decrease in investors’ share of operations of
$1.1 million, or 20.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2001, is attributable to our 2001 purchase of the
minority interest in nine street retail buildings in southern California and
three street retail buildings in Forest Hills, New York and the operating unit
holders’ share of the decrease in operating income in 2002.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate Net of Loss on Abandoned Developments Held for
Sale.

The approximately $300,000 increase in gain on sale of real estate, net
of loss on abandoned developments held for sale for the year ended December 31,
2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, is attributable to:

•

an increase in net gains recognized in 2002 from the sale of
six properties for a combined gain of $19.1 million in the second
quarter of 2002, as compared to the sale of one shopping center in
the second quarter of 2001 for a gain of $7.9 million, the

-37-


sale of one street retail property in the fourth quarter of 2001 for a
gain of $1.8 million and the exchange of a 90% interest in a street
retail building for a 10% interest in three street retail buildings
with a minority partner which resulted in a loss of
$500,000 in the fourth quarter of 2001; primarily offset by

•

the impairment loss of $9.7 million on the abandonment of
developments held for sale (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information).

Operating Income from Discontinued Operations

. Beginning in 2002, SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
requires that gains and losses from dispositions of properties and all
operating earnings from these properties be reported as income from operations
of discontinued assets. This also requires that all past earnings applicable
to a property disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2002 be reported as income
from operations of discontinued assets. As a result, the presentation
of reported
income will be updated each time a property is sold. This requirement is for
presentation only and has no impact on net income. As described above, in
2002, we sold six properties for a combined gain of $19.1 million. The
earnings generated from these properties have been reported as income from
operations of discontinued assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Income from
operations of discontinued assets for the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001 was $2.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively with the decrease being
primarily due to the fact that these properties were owned for less than a full
year in 2002.

Segment Results

We operate our business on an asset management model, where teams are
responsible for a portfolio of assets. We have divided our portfolio of
properties into three operating regions: the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and West.
Each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager, with dedicated
leasing, property management and financial staff and operates largely
autonomously with respect to day to day operating decisions. Incentive
compensation throughout the regional teams is tied to the property operating
income of the respective portfolios.

The following selected key segment data presented is for the full year,
except real estate assets and gross leasable area which is presented as of
year-end. The results of properties which have been disposed are excluded from
property operating income presented below in accordance with SFAS No. 144.

Property operating income consists of rental income, other property income
and interest income, less rental expense and real estate taxes. This measure
is used internally to evaluate the performance of our regional operations and
we consider it to be a significant measurement.

MID-ATLANTIC

The Mid-Atlantic region extends roughly from Baltimore
south through metropolitan
Washington, D.C. and further south through Virginia and North Carolina. Two
properties in Florida are also included in this region. As of December 31,
2003, the Mid-Atlantic included 35 properties after three acquisitions in 2003
(Mount Vernon Plaza, South Valley Shopping Center and Plaza del Mercado) and
two disposals in 2003 (4929 and 4925 Bethesda Avenue). There was no
acquisition or disposal activity in 2002 in this region but 2002 saw increased
results from Pentagon Row which was phased into service between 2001 and 2002
and from the impact of Friendship Center which was acquired in 2001. The
Williamsburg Shopping Center was sold in 2001.

Total revenue in the Mid-Atlantic grew 8.0% in 2003 after showing 13%
growth in 2002. The revenue growth in 2003 largely reflects the increase in
leasable area related to acquisitions as well as increased expense recovery.
The significant growth in 2002 is due primarily to the acquisition of
Friendship Center but also to the additional income from Pentagon Row which
opened in late 2001 and the successful retenanting at several shopping centers.
Development fees earned in 2003 and 2002 amounted to $1.0 million and $0.8
million, respectively, and tend to be non-recurring.

-39-


The percentage leased was 93%, 96% and 96% as of year end 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The decrease in 2003 occupancy reflects the impact of several anchor
closings, including K-mart, the impact of acquiring Mt. Vernon Plaza and South
Valley Shopping Center, both of which had

lower than average occupancy when acquired, and an increase in
re-development activity which will keep leasable space out of service until the
redevelopments are complete. We expect that the increased redevelopment
activity will continue in 2004 and 2005.

The improved rate of operating income to total revenue in the Mid-Atlantic
in 2003 was caused largely by a decrease in expenses which are not recoverable
from tenants, particularly legal costs, and lower overhead expenses. The
property operating margin to revenue decreased in 2002 when compared to 2001 as
a rise in property taxes was not completely offset by a similar rise in cost
recoveries for the year.

NORTHEAST

The Northeast region extends from suburban Philadelphia north through New
York and its suburbs into New England. This region also includes several
properties located in Illinois and one located in Michigan. As of December 31,
2003, the Northeast region had 42 properties which reflects one acquisition and
seven buildings disposed in 2003 and four small buildings disposed in 2002.
One property was sold in 2001.

In
the Northeast, total revenue was flat in 2003 when compared to 2002
after rising 7% in 2002 when compared to 2001. Northeast total revenue was flat in 2003
versus 2002 as a decrease in occupancy rates was offset by an increase in common area expense recoveries,
particularly related to snow removal in the first quarter of 2003, and to real
estate tax recoveries. The growth in 2002 over 2001 was driven primarily by an
increase in rental rates at redeveloped, expanded and retenanted centers as
well as increased rental rates on rollovers and increased recoveries related to
refinements in the recovery accrual process.

The
percentage leased was 95%, 96% and 96% as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The slight decrease in 2003 reflects the closing of
several principal tenants, including K-mart, an increase in re-development
activity which has taken leasable space out of service and the acquisition of
Mercer Mall whose leased rate is currently below that of the rest of the
region. Mercer Mall had a leased rate of approximately 80% when acquired
in October 2003. We expect that the increased redevelopment activity will
continue in 2004 and 2005.

The decrease in the rate of operating income to total revenue in 2003 when
compared to 2002 was caused largely by a lower recovery rate on higher common
area expenses, particularly due to the snow removal costs incurred in the first
quarter of 2003. In addition, the region experienced lower lease termination
fees in 2003 and higher costs to provide utilities at our Fresh Meadows
property. The increased operating income margin in 2002 over 2001 was due to
improved cost recoveries on relatively flat rental expenses.

WEST

As of December 31, 2003, 34 of our properties, including Santana Row, were
located in the West region. The West region extends from Texas to the West
Coast. In 2003, we disposed of one parcel of undeveloped land while in 2002 we
disposed of one shopping center and exchanged the property at 580 Market Street
in San Francisco, California for the minority partner’s interest in Santana
Row. In 2001, we sold one shopping center in the West region.

-40-


Total revenue in the West rose $30.8 million, or 81%, in 2003 over 2002 of
which $21.3 million relates to increased total revenues at Santana Row as well
as the impact of the 2002 $1.3 million write-down associated with the
impairment of our restaurant joint ventures, which was charged to other income
in 2002. In addition, approximately $8.0 million of the rental income growth
comes from the insurance proceeds received related to the fire at Santana Row. The
insurance proceeds are reported as part of rental income as they relate largely
to lost rents on the delayed opening of the residential and retail units and rental concessions to tenants.
Excluding the Santana Row revenue growth and the insurance proceeds, total
revenue growth in 2003 was 4% as higher income in San Antonio, Texas and
southern California more than offset lower revenue at our property at 150 Post
Street in San Francisco, California. Total revenue growth in 2002 over 2001
was due largely to increased rental rates at redeveloped and retenanted
properties and Santana Row coming on line in
2002 which was offset by a decrease in revenue related to 580 Market Street
which was sold in 2002. Income from the insurance proceeds of approximately
$3.0 million will be recognized in 2004.

For
the West region, the percentage leased was 88%, 84% and 93% at years
ending 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Santana Row development
added approximately 529,000 square feet of retail space to the West Coast since
the end of 2001. The improved occupancy as of year end 2003 compared to the
end of 2002 is due largely to increases at Santana Row and Houston Street in
San Antonio, Texas.

The West region’s property operating income margin to revenue improved in
2003 over 2002 due almost entirely to the significant growth in revenue at
Santana Row. The operating expenses associated with Santana Row started
increasing in 2002 as a result of leasing, marketing and other start-up costs
in preparation for and during the opening of this project. In 2003, we
incurred a full year of operating expenses but rental revenues continued
growing during the year as occupancy increased. The West’s property operating
income margin dropped in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the opening of Santana
described above partly offset by in an increase in interest income from
mortgage notes receivable. We expect the margin to again increase in 2004 due
to higher occupancy at Santana Row and our property in San Antonio, Texas but
at a slower pace than the improvement in 2003.

The success of Santana Row and Houston Street in San Antonio, Texas will
depend on many factors which are not entirely within our control. We monitor
current and long-term economic forecasts for these markets in order to evaluate
the long-term financial returns of these projects. The overall return on
investment in the West segment significantly lags the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic due to the phasing into service of Santana Row and Houston Street.
We expect that the returns on investment in the West will continue to rise as
these projects come into service but not necessarily to the same level of
overall returns as generated in the other segments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Due to the nature of our business and our strategy, we are generally in a
position to generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash
generated from operations is primarily paid to shareholders in the form of
dividends. One of the requirements of our maintaining our status as a REIT is
the requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income each year.
Therefore, cash needs for executing our strategy and investing in new

-41-


properties as well as payment of debt maturities must come from
cash not distributed to shareholders, from  proceeds of property
dispositions, or from the proceeds of raising new capital by issuing
equity or debt securities.

It is management’s intention that we continually have access to the
capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business. As such, we
intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will
allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage
ratios as part of our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. At December
31, 2003, our level of debt to total market capitalization was 39%. We may,
from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings,
unsecured debt financings and/or mortgage financings and other debt and equity
alternatives, including formation of joint-ventures, in a manner consistent
with our intention to operate with a conservative debt structure.

In
2003, we undertook several transactions to improve our liquidity,
including the redemption of $100 million of 7.95% preferred stock with the
proceeds of a common equity offering, the redemption and payment in
June 2003 of the $75 million of our 5 1/4% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures outstanding and due to mature in October 2003
with borrowings under our lower interest rate credit facility, and
the refinancing and replacement of our $300 million revolving
credit facility and $125 million term loan, both scheduled to mature in December
2003, with a new $550 million unsecured credit facility. The new credit
facility consists of a $150 million five-year term loan, a $100 million three-year term loan, and a $300 million
three-year revolving credit facility with a one-year
extension option. The term loans bear interest at LIBOR
plus 95 basis points while the revolving facility bears interest at LIBOR plus
75 basis points. See “Recent Developments” above for a discussion of
our financing transactions subsequent to year end 2003.

Our
cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003 were $35.0
million, an increase from $23.1 million at December 31, 2002.

The
cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the

operation of our properties and includes $8 million of insurance
proceeds related to reimbursement of lost rent at Santana Row. We used cash
of
$26.7 million to increase our working capital primarily as a result of an increase in
notes receivable and an
increase in current assets related to properties acquired.

We used net cash of $91.3 million in investing activities during
2003, consisting of $139.8 million of cash provided by investing
activities and $231.1 million of cash used in investing
activities.

The net  cash provided by our investing activities represents:

•

$95.9 million of proceeds from our final insurance settlement related to the fire at Santana Row used to reduce our cost basis; and

•

$43.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of real estate.

The net cash used in our investing activities reflects:

•

an investment of  $123.9 million in property development activities;

•

the use of $50.6 million for capital expenditures in connection with redevelopment of properties and tenant improvements;

•

an investment of $50.6 million to acquire properties; and

•

the repayment of $5.9 million of mortgage notes outstanding.

We expect that capital expenditures for  development activities, particularly
 at Santana Row, will decrease in 2004.  We are not able to project our level
 of acquisitions or dispositions in future years but expect that we will be able to fund
 acquisitions and our redevelopment pipeline through available means of financing.

-42-


We used net cash of $19.3 million for
 financing activities during 2003, consisting of $324.7 million used in financing
activities and $305.4 million of cash provided by financing activities.

The cash used in financing activities primarily reflects:

•

payments on mortgages, capital leases and notes payable of $117.9 million;

•

payment of dividends of $104.8 million; and

•

redemption of preferred shares of $100.0 million.

The cash provided by our financing activities primarily represents:

•

proceeds from the issuance of common shares in a public offering of $98.4 million;

•

proceeds from the issuance of common shares for exercise of options and operating units of approximately $53.0 million;

•

net proceeds from issuing term notes of $125.0 million; and

•

increased borrowings under short-term debt of $28.8 million.

(a)

Under the terms of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement, from
        and after January 1, 1986, an unaffiliated third party, has the right
        to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase from half
        to all of its 37.5% interest in Congressional Plaza at the interest’s then-current fair market value. Based
        on management’s current estimate of fair market value, our estimated
        liability upon exercise of the put option is approximately $28.0 million.
        In conjunction with the construction of apartments at the property completed
        in 2003, we have agreed to acquire 7.5% of the third party’s interest
        in Congressional Plaza, thereby lowering its ownership percentage to 30%,
        in exchange for funding approximately $7 million of its share of the redevelopment
        cost. The development funding has taken place in 2003 and the acquisition
        of the third party’s 7.5% interest is anticipated to be completed
        in 2004. After the completion of this transaction, our estimated liability
        upon the exercise of the put option will be approximately $21 million.

(b)

Under the terms of four other partnerships which own street retail
properties in southern California with a cost of approximately $61
million, if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the
properties owned by the partnerships, the other partners may require us
to purchase their partnership interests at a formula price based upon
property operating income. The purchase price may be paid in cash or
for two of the partnerships, a limited number of our common shares at
the election of the other partners. In those partnerships, if the
other partners do not redeem their interest, we may choose to purchase
the limited partnership interests upon the same terms.

(c)

Street Retail San Antonio LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Trust, entered into a Development Agreement (the “Agreement”) on March
13, 2000 with the City of San Antonio, Texas (the “City”) related to
the redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along Houston
Street. Houston Street and the surrounding area have been designated by
the City as a Reinvestment Zone (the “Zone”). The City agreed to
facilitate redevelopment of the Zone by undertaking and financing
certain public improvements based on our agreement to redevelop our
properties in the Zone. Under the terms of the Agreement, the City
issued

-43-


debt to fund specific public improvements within the Zone. The
initial and primary source of funding to the City for repayment of the
debt and debt service is the incremental tax revenue that accretes to
the City as the taxable value of the redeveloped properties within the
Zone increases. We are required to issue an annual letter of credit,
commencing on October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2014, that covers
our designated portion of the debt service should the incremental tax
revenue generated in the Zone not cover the debt service. We posted a
letter of credit with the City on September 25, 2002 for $795,000. Our
obligation under this Agreement is estimated to range from $1.6 million
to $3.0 million of which approximately $360,000 has been funded in
2003. We have accrued for additional payments of $1.2 million as of
September 30, 2003 as part of the project costs in anticipation of a
shortfall of incremental tax revenues to the City. We could be
required to provide funding beyond the $1.2 million currently accrued
under the Agreement prior to its expiration on September 30, 2014. We
do not anticipate that such obligation would exceed $600,000 in any
year nor exceed $3 million in total. If the Zone creates sufficient tax
increment funding to repay the City’s debt prior to the expiration of
the Agreement, we will be eligible to receive reimbursement of amounts
paid for debt service shortfalls together with interest thereon.

(d)

Under the terms of various other partnerships which own shopping
center properties with a cost of approximately $88.5 million, including
one of the two shopping centers purchased in the first quarter of 2003,
the partners may exchange their 852,222 operating units for cash or the
same number of our common shares, at our option. On February 14, 2003
we paid $333,000 to redeem 12,000 operating units. On April 3, 2003 we
issued 64,952 of our common shares valued at $1.9 million in exchange
for 64,952 operating units. On January 5, 2004, we paid $199,000 to
redeem an additional 5,100 operating units.

(e)

In addition to our contractual obligations we have other short-term
liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal recurring
operating expenses, regular debt service requirements (including debt
service relating to additional and replacement debt), recurring
corporate expenditures including compensation agreements, non-recurring
corporate expenditures (such as tenant improvements and redevelopments)
and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. Overall capital
requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of
improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing
and cost of future phases of Santana Row.

The interest rate is fixed at 5.66% for the first ten years and then is
reset to a market rate. The lender has the option to call the loan after
year ten.

2.

This loan currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. In January 2004,
we purchased interest rate swaps or hedges on this note, thereby locking
in the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.401% through October 2006.

3.

The loan requires monthly interest only payments through maturity. This
loan bears interest at a variable rate determined weekly to be the
interest rate which would enable the bonds to be remarketed at 100% of
their principal amount. The weighted average interest rate for the year
ended December 31, 2003 was 3.060%. The property is not encumbered by a
lien.

On October 8, 2003, we closed on a new credit agreement replacing our
then existing credit agreement. The new agreement includes $300 million
three-year revolving credit

facility which currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The spread over LIBOR is subject to
adjustment based on our credit rating. The maximum
amount drawn under our old and new facilities during 2003 was $225
million. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under these
facilities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 3.39%.

5.

We purchased interest rate swaps at issuance, thereby reducing the
effective interest rate from 6.74% to 6.37%.

6.

We purchased interest rate swaps at issuance, thereby reducing the
effective interest rate from 6.99% to 6.894%.

7.

The Trust purchased an interest rate lock to hedge a planned note
offering. A hedge loss of $1.5 million associated with this hedge is being
amortized into the November 2002 note offering thereby increasing the
effective interest rate on these notes to 6.325%.

8.

Beginning on August 15, 2008, the debentures are redeemable by the
holders thereof at the original purchase price.

Beginning on August 1, 2007, the notes are redeemable by the holders
thereof at the original purchase price.

Our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial covenants
that may limit our operating activities in the future. These covenants require
us to comply with a number of financial provisions using calculations of ratios
and other amounts that are not normally useful to a financial statement reader
and are calculated in a manner that is not in accordance with GAAP.
Accordingly, the numeric information set forth below is calculated as required
by our various loan agreements rather than in accordance with GAAP. We have
not included a reconciliation of this information to GAAP information because,
in this case, there is no directly comparable GAAP measure, similarly titled
GAAP measures are not relevant in determining whether or not we are in
compliance with our financial covenants and we believe that the ratios on our
material covenants are relevant to the reader. These covenants require us to:

•

limit the amount of debt so that our interest and other fixed
charge coverage will exceed 1.75 to 1 (we maintained a ratio of 2.38 to
1 as of December 31, 2003);

•

limit the amount of debt as a percentage of total asset value to
less than .55 to 1 (we maintained a ratio of 0.51 to 1 as of December
31, 2003);

•

limit the amount of secured debt as a percentage of total asset
value to less than .30 to 1 (we maintained a ratio of 0.16 to 1 as of
December 31, 2003);

•

limit the amount of unsecured debt so that unencumbered asset value
to unsecured debt will equal or exceed 1.75 to 1 (we maintained a ratio
of 2.26 to 1 as of December 31, 2003); and

•

limit the total cost of development projects under construction to
15% or less of total asset value (the total budgeted cost of our projects under
construction at December 31, 2003 represented 2.7% of gross asset
value).

We are also obligated to comply with other covenants, including, among
others, provisions:

•

relating to the maintenance of any property securing a mortgage;

•

restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;

•

restricting our ability to incur additional debt;

•

restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases;

•

restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and

•

restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

-46-


As of December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with all of our financial
covenants. If we were to breach any of our debt covenants, including the
listed covenants, and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure
period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the
debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the
property securing the loan. Many of our debt arrangements, including our
public notes and our credit facility, are cross-defaulted which means that the
lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require
immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant
under certain of our other debt obligations. As a result, any default under our
debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our
results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value
of our shares.

Below are the aggregate principal payments required as of December 31,
2003 under our debt financing arrangements by year. Scheduled principal
installments and amounts due at maturity are included.

Our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that
we may incur.

Interest Rate Hedging

We enter into derivative contracts, which qualify as cash flow hedges
under SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”, in order to manage interest rate risk. Derivatives are not
purchased for speculation.

In January 2004, to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our $150
million, five-year term loan issued in October 2003, we entered into interest
rate swaps, which fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.401%
through October 2006. The interest rate on the term loan as of December 31,
2003 was LIBOR plus 95 basis points, thus, subsequent to year end we swapped
the floating rate debt to a fixed interest rate of 3.351% on notional amounts
totaling $150 million. On the January 2004 hedge, we are exposed to credit loss
in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to the interest rate
protection agreement should interest rates exceed the cap. However, management
does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. The
counterparty
has a long-term debt rating of “A” by Standard and Poor’s Ratings
Service (“S&P”) “A1” by Moody’s
Investors Service (“Moody’s”) as of March 8, 2004.
Although our swap is not exchange traded, there are a number of financial
institutions which enter into these types of transactions as part of their
day-to-day activities. The swap has been documented as a cash flow hedge and
designated as effective at inception of the swap contract.

-47-


Consequently, the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swap at
its fair value will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income
within shareholders’ equity and either a derivative instrument asset or
liability is recorded on the balance sheet.

The hedges open at the end of the third quarter 2003 relating to our $125
million term loan which was to mature on December 19, 2003, were unwound on
October 8, 2003, in connection with the repayment of that loan, at a cost of
approximately $1.1 million which was charged to interest expense in the fourth
quarter of 2003.

Liquidity Requirements

Short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under
capital and operating leases, normal recurring operating expenses, regular debt
service requirements (including debt service relating to additional or
replacement debt, as well as scheduled debt maturities), recurring corporate
expenditures, non-recurring corporate expenditures (such as tenant improvements
and redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders.
Overall capital requirements in 2004 and beyond will depend upon acquisition
opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing
properties and the timing and cost of future phases of Santana Row. We expect
to fund our capital requirements, as well as our development and redevelopment
costs, acquisitions and normal recurring operating costs through a combination
of cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our credit facility
and other funding sources which may consist of additional and replacement debt,
both secured and unsecured, additional equity, joint venture relationships and
property dispositions.

We expect to fund our long-term capital requirements, which consist
primarily of maturities under our long-term debt, development and redevelopment
costs and potential acquisition opportunities through a combination of funding
sources which we believe will be available to us including debt, both secured
and unsecured, additional equity, joint venture relationships and property
dispositions.

The following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity
requirements:

•

we may be unable to obtain debt or equity financing on
favorable terms, or at all, as a result of our financial
condition or market conditions at the time we seek additional
financing;

•

restrictions in our debt instruments or outstanding
equity may prohibit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at
all, or on terms available under then-prevailing market
conditions; and

•

we may be unable to service additional or replacement
debt due to increases in interest rates or a decline in our
operating performance.

REIT Qualification

We intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT under Section 856(c) of
the Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal
income taxes as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the Code,
including the requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income to our
shareholders.

-48-


Funds From Operations

We have historically reported our FFO in addition to our net income and
net cash provided by operating activities. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP
financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance. NAREIT
defines FFO as follows: income available for common shareholders before
depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and before extraordinary
items less gains on sale of real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative
measure of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize
that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated
on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO:

•

does not represent cash flows from operating activities in
accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash
effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net
income);

•

should not be considered an alternative to net income as an
indication of our performance; and

•

is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of
liquidity or ability to pay dividends.

We consider FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance
because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate
assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have
accepted it as a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to
similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due
to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by
such REITs.

An increase or decrease in FFO does not necessarily result in an increase
or decrease in aggregate distributions because our Board of Trustees is not
required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us
to maintain REIT status. However, we must distribute 90% of our REIT taxable
income (as defined in the Code) to remain qualified as a REIT. Therefore, a significant increase in FFO will
generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not
necessarily on a proportionate basis.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our use of financial instruments, such as debt instruments, subject us to
market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the
fair value of our assets. Market risk generally refers to the risk of loss
from changes in interest rates and market prices. We manage our market risk by
attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating, investing
and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt
payments, dividends to common and preferred shareholders, investments, capital
expenditures and other cash requirements. We also enter into derivative
financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to mitigate our interest rate
risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate
on a portion of our variable rate debt.

The following discussion of market risk is based solely on hypothetical
changes in interest rates related to our variable rate debt. This discussion
does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect the
financial instruments discussed in this section.

Interest Rate Risk

Our interest rate risk is most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates
on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2003, we had $359.1 million of
variable rate debt. Based upon this balance of variable rate debt, if
interest rates increased 1%, our earnings and cash flows for the year would
decrease by approximately $3.6 million. If interest rates decreased 1%, our
earnings and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately
$3.6
million. We believe that the change in the fair value of our financial
instruments resulting from a foreseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be
immaterial to our total assets and total liabilities.

In January 2004, we purchased
an interest rate swap on our $150 million term note which currently bears
interest at LIBOR plus 95 basis-points and is due to mature in October
2008. The swap has locked in the LIBOR portion of the interest rate
at 2.401% through October 2006.

Interest Rate Hedging

We use derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of our
variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to manage our fixed to variable rate
debt ratio. A description of these derivative financial instruments is
contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources -
Interest Rate Hedging.” and is incorporated by reference into this Item 7A.

Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants

Trustees and Shareholders of Federal Realty Investment Trust

We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Federal Realty Investment
Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) (the Trust) and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Trust’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The consolidated
financial statements of Federal Realty Investment Trust and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2001, and for the year then ended, were audited by other auditors
who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements in their report dated February 11,
2002.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Federal Realty
Investment Trust and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for each
of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited Schedules III and IV for the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002. In our opinion, these schedules present fairly, in all material
respects, the information therein when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Federal Realty
Investment Trust and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, and for the year
then ended, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As
described in Note 1, these financial statements have been restated to reflect
discontinued operations. We have audited the adjustments described in Note 1
that were applied to restate the 2001 financial statements. In our opinion,
such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we
were not engaged to audit, review or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial
statements of the Trust other than with respect to such adjustments, and,
accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the
2001 financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Trustees and Shareholders of Federal Realty Investment Trust:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Federal
Realty Investment Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, common shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each
of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Trust’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Federal Realty
Investment Trust and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three year period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The financial statement
schedules included on pages F-29 through F-34 of the Form 10-K are presented
for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules
and are not a required part of the basic consolidated financial statements.
These schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our
audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, are
fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole.

consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity and
other comprehensive income, and cash flows for the two fiscal years ended
December 31, 2000 referred to in this report have not been included in the
accompanying financial statements or schedules. In addition, Arthur Andersen’s
audit report relates to the financial statements of the Trust for 2000 and 2001

Federal Realty Investment Trust

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001

NOTE 1

. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Federal
Realty Investment Trust (the “Trust”) is an equity
real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership, management,
development and redevelopment of high quality community and neighborhood
shopping centers and main street mixed-use properties located in densely
developed urban and suburban areas in strategic metropolitan markets in the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions and California.

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a real estate
investment trust for federal income tax purposes. A trust which distributes at
least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income to its
shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be
taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders. Therefore, Federal income taxes have been and are generally
expected to be immaterial. We are obligated for state taxes, generally
consisting of franchise or gross receipts taxes in certain states. Such state
taxes have not been material.

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust,
its corporate subsidiaries, and numerous partnerships and limited liability companies,
all of which we control. The equity interests of other investors are reflected
as investors’ interest in consolidated assets. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. We account for our
interests in joint ventures which we do not control or manage using the equity
method of accounting.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which we refer
to as GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in
certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses.
These estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after
considering past and current events and economic conditions. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

. Leases with tenants are classified
as operating leases. Minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over
the terms of the related leases net of valuation adjustments based on
management’s assessment of credit, collection and other business risk.
Percentage rents, which represent additional rents based on gross tenant sales,
are recognized at the end of the lease year or other period in which tenant
sales’ thresholds have been reached and the percentage rents are due. Real
estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis
over the periods in which the expenditures occurred. We make estimates of the
collectibility of our accounts receivable related to base rents, including
straight line rentals, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income. In
some cases the ultimate
collectibility of these claims extends beyond one year. We generally reserve
for straight-line rents due beyond ten years due to uncertainty of collection.

-F7-


Real Estate

. Land, buildings
    and real estate under development are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed
    using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range generally from
    35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements. Maintenance
    and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant work and other
    major improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease
    or their estimated useful life, respectively. Upon termination of a lease,
    undepreciated tenant improvement costs are charged to operations if the assets
    are replaced and the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation
    are retired. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and
    depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15 years. In accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 66,
    “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”, sales are recognized at closing
    only when sufficient down payments have been obtained, possession and other
    attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and we have no
    significant continuing involvement. The gain or loss resulting from the sale
    of properties is included in net income at the time of sale.

We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of”. In cases where particular assets are
being held for sale, impairment is based on whether the fair value (estimated
sales price less costs of disposal) of each individual property to be sold is
less than the net book value. Otherwise, impairment is based on whether it is
probable that undiscounted future cash flows from each property will be less
than its net book value. If a property is impaired, its basis is adjusted to
its estimated fair market value.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (effective for us on January 1,
2002). SFAS No. 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or
newly-acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to
include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can
be distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the
rest of the entity.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” which addresses accounting and
processing for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. SFAS No. 146
requires the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity when the liability is incurred versus the date the Trust
commits to an exit plan. In addition, SFAS No. 146 states that the liability
should be initially measured at fair value. The requirements of SFAS No. 146
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December
31, 2002. This pronouncement has not had a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.

When applicable as lessee, we classify our leases of land and buildings as
operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 13,
“Accounting for Leases”.

Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development,
redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and
their related direct costs are capitalized. The capitalized costs associated
with developments, redevelopments and leasing are depreciated or amortized over
the life of the improvement or lease, whichever is shorter. Unamortized
leasing costs are charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates
before the expiration of its lease.

-F8-


Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as
part of the development and redevelopment until it is placed in service.
Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and
expenditures begin and end upon completion, i.e. when the asset is ready for
its intended use. Generally rental property is considered substantially
complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements,
but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity.

Debt Issue Costs

. Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are
capitalized and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the related
issue using the effective interest method. Upon conversion or in the
event of early
redemption, any unamortized costs are charged to operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

. We define cash as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial
institutions and short term liquid investments with an initial maturity under
three months. Cash balances in individual banks may exceed insurable amounts.

Risk Management.

We enter into derivative contracts, which qualify as cash flow
hedges under SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”, in order to manage interest rate risk. Derivatives are not
purchased for speculation. During 2001, to hedge our exposure to interest rates
on our $125 million term loan, we entered into interest rate swaps, which fixed
the LIBOR interest rate on that term loan at 5.27%. The interest rate on this
term loan was LIBOR plus 95 basis points, thus fixing the interest rate at
6.22% on notional amounts totaling $125 million. The swaps were documented as
cash flow hedges and designated as effective at inception of the swap contract.
Consequently, the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swaps at their
fair market value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income
within shareholders’ equity and either a derivative instrument asset or
liability is recorded on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, a cumulative
unrealized loss of $4.6 million, representing the difference between the then
current market value and the 6.22% fixed interest rate on the swap, was
recorded in other comprehensive income with a corresponding derivative
liability on the balance sheet. In October 2003, we unwound the interest rate
swaps which were due to expire December 19, 2003 at a cost of approximately
$1.1 million. There were no open derivative contracts at December 31, 2003.
In January 2004, to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our $150 million
term loan issued in October 2003, we entered into interest rate swaps, which
fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.40% through October 2006.

In anticipation of a $150 million Senior Unsecured Note offering, on
August 1, 2002, we entered into a treasury rate lock that fixed the benchmark
five year treasury rate at 3.472% through August 19, 2002. The rate lock was
documented as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction and designated as
effective at the inception of the contract. On August 16, 2002, we priced the
Senior Unsecured Notes with a scheduled closing date of August 21, 2002 and
closed out the associated rate lock. Five year treasury rates declined between
the pricing period and the settlement of the hedge purchase; therefore, to
settle the rate lock, we paid $1.5 million. As a result of the August 19, 2002
fire at Santana Row, we were not able to proceed with the note offering at that
time. However, we consummated a $150 million Senior Unsecured Note offering on
November 15, 2002, and thus, the hedge loss is being amortized into
interest expense over the life of the related Notes.

-F9-


Acquisition, Development and Construction Loan Arrangements

. We have made
certain mortgage loans that, because of their nature, qualify as loan
receivables. At the time the loans were made, we did not intend for the
arrangement to be anything other than a financing and did not contemplate a
real estate investment. Using guidance set forth in the Third Notice to
Practitioners issued by the AICPA in February 1986 entitled “ADC Arrangements”
(“the Third Notice”), we evaluate each investment to determine whether the loan
arrangement qualifies under the Third Notice as a loan, joint venture or real
estate investment and the appropriate accounting thereon. Such determination
affects our balance sheet classification of these investments and the
recognition of interest income derived therefrom. Generally, we receive
additional interest on these loans, however we never receive in excess of 50%
of the residual profit in the project (as defined in the Third Notice) and
because the borrower has either a substantial investment in the project or has
guaranteed all or a portion of our loan (or a combination thereof) the loans
qualify for loan accounting. The amounts under ADC arrangements at December 31,
2003 and 2002 were $48.9 million and $35.6 million respectively and interest
income recognized thereon was $3.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively.

Comprehensive Income

. Our interest rate swaps were documented as cash flow
hedges and designated as effective at inception of the swap contract,
therefore, the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swaps at their fair
market value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income within
shareholders’ equity. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”, investments purchased in connection
with our nonqualified deferred compensation plan are classified as available
for sale securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on
these investments purchased to match our obligation to the participants is also
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2003
these investments consisted of mutual funds and are stated at market value.

Earnings Per Share

. We calculate basic and diluted earnings per share in
accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”. Basic EPS excludes dilution
and is computed by dividing net income available for common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted into common shares
and then shared in our earnings.

Stock-Based Compensation.

In December 2002 the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure” as an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”.
SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure provisions to require prominent disclosure
about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s accounting policy
decisions with respect to stock-based compensation. Stock options are
accounted for using the intrinsic method in accordance with APB No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” as interpreted, whereby if options
are priced at fair market value or above at the date of grant and the number of
shares is fixed or certain, no compensation expense is recognized. In
addition, certain of our stock-based compensation arrangements provide for
performance-based vesting which calls for the use of “variable plan accounting”
whereby compensation expense is periodically recorded for the intrinsic value
of vested shares. Historically, compensation arising from such arrangements
has not been material to operations. The pro forma information is as follows

Reclassifications

. Certain components of rental income, other property income,
rental expense, real estate tax expense and depreciation and amortization on
the December 31, 2002 and 2001 Consolidated Statements of Operations have been
reclassified to Income from operations of discontinued assets to assure
comparability of all periods presented. In addition, certain balance sheet
accounts have been reclassified to assure comparability of all periods
presented.

Redemption of preferred stock.

On June 13, 2003, we redeemed our $100 million
7.95% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at their face value. The
original issuance costs of $3.4 million were charged to shareholders’ equity in
1997, when the shares were issued. On July 31, 2003, the Emerging Issues Task
Force provided clarification on the treatment of the difference between the
redemption value and the carrying value, adjusting for issuance costs, for GAAP
financial reporting. In accordance with this clarification, we are required to
make a change in accounting to retroactively reflect this difference as a
reduction of net earnings to arrive at net earnings available to common
shareholders. As a result of this change in accounting presentation, our
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003
reflects a charge of $3.4 million in the line “Preferred stock redemption -
excess of redemption cost over carrying value” as a reduction of net income in
computing net income available for common shareholders.

Guarantor’s Accounting.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 addresses the
disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.
FIN 45 also requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee,
a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 were effective for us on
December 31, 2002. The liability recognition requirements are applicable
prospectively to all guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The
adoption of this pronouncement has not had a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.

Variable Interest Entities

. On January 31, 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”).
FIN 46 clarifies existing accounting for whether interest entities should be
consolidated in financial statements based upon the investees ability to
finance its activities without additional financial support and whether
investors possess characteristics of a controlling financial interest. We have
evaluated the applicability of FIN 46 to our investments in certain restaurant
joint ventures established in 2001 and 2002 at Santana Row and have determined
that these joint ventures do not meet the definition of a Variable Interest
Entity and therefore consolidation of these ventures is not required.
Accordingly, these investments will continue to be accounted for using the
equity method.

As of December 31, 2003, we have invested approximately $7.8 million in these
ventures, principally to fund buildout costs of each restaurant. Of this
amount, $6.5 million has been capitalized as an investment in these ventures
and $1.3 million was expensed in 2002 to reflect our estimate of the permanent
impairment of our investment in two of these ventures due principally to
declining economic conditions. We are currently committed to invest a total of
$8.0 million in these ventures and as such, our maximum exposure to further
losses as a result of involvement in these ventures is $6.7 million at December
31, 2003.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149.

In April 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities” which clarifies the accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments. The statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified
after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 has not had a material effect on
the Trust’s financial statements.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150.

In May 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No 150 “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 addresses the
classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments, including
mandatorily redeemable preferred and common stock, and requires an issuer to
classify certain instruments as liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 has
not had a material effect on the Trust’s financial Statements.

Retail and mixed-use properties includes
the residential portion of our Santana Row development partner. The residential property
investments comprised our investments in Rollingwood Apartments
and Crest Apartments at Congressional Plaza.

During
2003 we expended cash of $174.5 million to improve, redevelop and
develop our existing real estate. Of the $174.5 million spent in 2003 on our
existing real estate portfolio, approximately $123.9 million was invested in our
Santana Row development project, located in San Jose, California. The
remaining $50.6 million of capital expenditures relates to improvements to
common areas, tenant work and various redevelopments, including the cost of
Congressional Apartments in Rockville, Maryland, the redevelopment of retail
buildings in San Antonio, Texas and the completion of tenant work at the
Woodmont East development in Bethesda, Maryland.

During 2003, we expended cash of $50.6 million acquiring four shopping
centers and $55.4 million of assets were acquired through capital leases.

On March 21,
    2003, a partnership in which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general
    partner, purchased the 214,000 square foot South Valley Shopping Center in
    Alexandria, Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $13.7 million
    in cash. All of the purchase price has been allocated to real estate assets
    except for approximately $125,000 which has been allocated to prepaid and
    other assets associated with the net fair value assigned to above-market leases
    assumed and $332,000 which has been allocated to other liabilities associated
    with the net fair value assigned to below-market leases assumed.

-F13-


On March 31,
    2003, the same partnership acquired the leasehold interest, which extends
    through December 31, 2077, in the 257,000 square foot Mount Vernon Plaza
    in Alexandria, Virginia, for aggregate consideration of approximately $17.5 million
    in the form of approximately $700,000 of cash, 120,000 partnership units valued
    at $3.5 million and the assumption of a $13.3 million mortgage. All of
    the purchase price has been allocated to real estate assets except for approximately
    $756,000 which has been allocated to prepaid and other assets associated with
    the net fair value assigned to above-market leases assumed and $1.75 million
    which has been allocated to other liabilities
associated with the net fair value assigned to the assumed leases at the property
    assigned.

On October 14,
    2003, the Trust acquired the leasehold interest, which extends through September 30,
    2028, in the 321,000 square foot Mercer Mall in Lawrenceville, New Jersey
    for $10.5 million paid out of proceeds from dispositions and from borrowings
    under our credit facility. The master lease includes a fixed purchase price
    option for $55 million in 2023. If we fail to exercise our purchase option,
    the owner of Mercer Mall has a put option which would require us to purchase
    Mercer Mall for $60 million in 2025. All of the purchase price has been
    allocated to real estate assets except for approximately $736,000 allocated
    to prepaid and other assets associated with the net fair value assigned to
    above-market leases assumed, and $2.4 million allocated to other liabilities
    associated with the net fair value assigned to below-market leases assumed.

On October 31,
    2003, FR Plaza del Mercado, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust, purchased
    the 96,000 square foot Plaza del Mercado shopping center located in Silver
    Spring, Maryland for a purchase price of approximately $20 million in
    cash. All of the purchase price has been allocated to real estate assets except
    for approximately $929,000 fair value assigned to above-market leases assumed
    and $962,000 allocated to other liabilities associated with the net fair value
    assigned to below-market leases assumed.

On December 4,
    2003, FR Mercer Mall, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust, purchased
    a 40,000 square foot out-parcel of Mercer Mall in Lawrenceville, New Jersey
    for a purchase price of approximately $6.5 million including the assumption.
    All of the purchase price has been allocated to real estate assets except
    for approximately $15,000 which has been allocated to prepaid and other assets
    associated with the net fair value assigned to above-market lease assumed.

On June 16, 2003, we sold the street retail property located at 4929
Bethesda Avenue in Bethesda, Maryland for approximately $1.5 million resulting
in a gain of $551,000.

During the first quarter of 2003 an action was filed by a local
governmental authority to condemn a shopping center in Rockville, Maryland,
owned by one of our partnerships to facilitate the authority’s redevelopment of
its town center. The shopping center has a cost basis of $10.5 million and
contributes less than 1% to our rental income. We have agreed with the governmental
authority on a condemnation
value of $14.3 million, subject to certain terms, and anticipate closing of this transaction in mid-2004. Because the
anticipated condemnation proceeds are in excess of our carrying value, we have
not recorded any impairment in value of the property.

On July 31, 2003 we sold the street retail property located at 4925
Bethesda Avenue in Bethesda, Maryland for approximately $1.1 million resulting
in a gain of $157,000.

On September 12, 2003 we sold the undeveloped land located in Washington
County, Oregon for approximately $9.7 million resulting in a gain of $1.9
million.

On September 15, 2003 we sold the street retail property located in
Brookline, Massachusetts for approximately $8.2 million resulting in a gain of
$4.3 million.

-F14-


On September 22, 2003 we sold a street retail property located at 2106
Central Avenue in North Evanston, Illinois for approximately $1.8 million
resulting in a gain of $780,000.

On October 31, 2003 we sold a street retail property located at 234
Greenwich Avenue in Greenwich, Connecticut for approximately $8.0 million,
resulting in a gain of $4.5 million.

On December 18, 2003 we sold four street retail properties located in West
Hartford, Connecticut for approximately $15.7 million, resulting in a gain of
approximately $7.9 million.

These property sales constitute discontinued operations and as such, the
accompanying financial statements have been restated to reclassify the
operations of these properties as discontinued operations. A summary of the
financial information for the discontinued operations is as follows:

On
February 1, 2002, we redeemed the minority partner’s interest in
Santana Row in exchange for a $2.6 million investment in a partnership. We made
a $5.9 million loan to the partnership in January 2001 that was due
February 28, 2003 but was not repaid on the due date. The loan
currently bears interest at 7.88% and is secured by an office
building in San Francisco, California. We are currently
negotiating with the borrower to extend the loan through
March 31, 2005. When the loan modification is complete, the
interest rate on the note will decrease to 6%, retroactive to July 1,
2003. Interest on the loan is current through December 31, 2003 and
based in part on the value of the underlying collateral, we believe
the loan is collectible and as such, no reserve has been established at
this time.

Our
111 retail properties at December 31, 2003 are located in 14 states
and the District of Columbia. There are approximately 2,200 tenants providing
a wide range of retail products and services. These tenants range from sole
proprietorships to national retailers; no one tenant or corporate group of
tenants accounts for more than 2.3% of annualized base rent.

Mortgage notes receivable of $48.9 million are due over various terms from
February 2003 to May 2021 and have a weighted average interest rate of 9.07%.
Under the terms of certain of these mortgages, we will receive additional
interest based upon the gross income of the secured properties and, upon sale
of the properties, we will share in the appreciation of the properties.

Mortgages payable and capital lease obligations are due in installments
over various terms extending to 2028 and 2060, respectively, with interest
rates ranging from 3.14% to 11.25%. Certain of the capital lease obligations
require additional interest payments based upon property performance.

On November 19, 2002 we used the proceeds from our $150 million public
note offering, as well as $20 million of available insurance proceeds relating
to the Santana Row fire and approximately $7.1 million in borrowings under our
credit facility, to pay in full and retire the Santana Row construction loan.

At December 31, 2002 there was $24.4 million borrowed under the
construction loan for our Woodmont East development in Bethesda, Maryland. The
loan had a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 120 basis points. On February
11, 2003 the $24.4 million Woodmont East

Leasing Arrangements

Our
leases with commercial property and residential tenants are classified as
operating leases. Leases on apartments are generally for a period of one year
or less. Commercial property leases generally range from three to ten years
(certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer), and in addition to minimum
rents, usually provide for contingent rentals based on the tenant’s gross sales
and sharing of certain operating costs.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by us,
using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimates of fair value. The
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that
could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.

We estimate the fair value of our financial instruments using the
following methods and assumptions: (1) quoted market prices, when available,
are used to estimate the fair value of investments in marketable debt and
equity securities; (2) quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value
of our marketable convertible subordinated debentures; (3) discounted

-F17-


cash flow analyses are used to estimate the fair value of mortgage notes
receivable and payable, using our estimate of current interest rates for
similar notes in 2003, the carrying amount on the balance sheet was used to
approximate fair value for mortgage notes receivable since these notes are for
specific deals, some contain participation provisions based on the property
performance and also are convertible into ownership of the properties; (4)
carrying amounts on the balance sheet approximate fair value for cash, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and short term borrowings. Notes receivable from
officers are excluded from fair value estimation since they have been issued in
connection with employee stock ownership programs.

On October 8, 2003, we closed on a new $550 million unsecured credit
facility which replaced our $300 million revolving credit facility and $125
million term loan, both of which were due to mature on December 19, 2003. The
new credit facility consists of a $150 million five-year term loan, a $100
million three-year term loan, and a $300 million three-year revolving credit
facility, with a one-year extension option. The term loans currently bear interest at
LIBOR plus 95 basis points, while the revolving facility currently bears interest at
LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The spread over LIBOR is subject to
adjustment based on our credit rating. Covenants under the new credit facility are
substantially the same type as were required under the previous facility.
Concurrent with the replacement of our $125 million term loan with the new
credit facility, we unwound the related interest rate swaps which were due to
expire on December 19, 2003 at of cost of approximately $1.1 million.

The maximum amount drawn under these revolving credit facilities during
2003, 2002 and 2001 was $215.0 million, $225.0 million and $308.5 million,
respectively. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the weighted average interest rate on
borrowings was 3.4%, 5.0% and 5.6%, respectively,

-F18-


and the average amount outstanding was $96.9 million, $189.1 million and
$269.7 million, respectively.

In January 2004, we issued $75 million of fixed rate notes which mature in
February 2011 and bear interest at 4.50%. The proceeds of this note offering
were used to pay down our revolving credit facility.

NOTE 5

. 5 1/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

In October 1993, we issued $75.0 million of 5 1/4% convertible
subordinated debentures, realizing cash proceeds of approximately $73.0
million. The debentures which were convertible into shares of beneficial
interest at $36 per share were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933
and were not publicly distributed within the United States. We
redeemed and paid in full our $75.0 million debentures originally due
to mature on October 28, 2003, on June 23, 2003.

On November 19, 2002, we completed the sale of $150 million of senior
notes in an underwritten public offering under our shelf registration statement
declared effective by the SEC on September 30, 1998. Net proceeds, after
deducting the discounts and commissions to the underwriters and other expenses
of this offering, totaled approximately $148.7 million. The net proceeds,
together with $20 million in available insurance proceeds relating to the
Santana Row fire, and approximately $7.1 million in borrowings under our credit
facility, were used to pay in full and retire the Santana Row construction
loan, including all interest owed on the loan.

The loan agreements contain various covenants, including limitations on
the amount of debt and minimum debt service coverage ratios. We are in
compliance with all covenants. No principal is due on these notes prior to
maturity.

In October 2002, we filed a $500 million shelf registration statement,
declared effective on November 6, 2002, with the Securities and Exchange
Commission which allows the issuance of debt securities, preferred shares and
common shares. As of December 31, 2003,  $400 million was available
under the shelf registration. Subsequent to December 31, 2003, the
capacity was reduced by $75 million as a result of a note offering
in January  2004.

DIVIDENDS

On December 2, 2003 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.49 per common share, payable January 15, 2004 to common shareholders of
record January 2, 2004. The total dividend declared per common share for 2003
was $1.95.

Also on December 2, 2003 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend
of $0.53125 per share on its Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares,
payable on January 30, 2004 to shareholders of record on January 15, 2004,
respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, $0.29 of dividends paid per common
share represent a capital gain. $0.36 of dividends paid per Series B
preferred share represent a capital gain. $0.21 dividends paid per Series A
preferred share represent a capital gain. For the year ended December 31,
2002, $0.37 of dividends paid per common share and per Series B preferred share
represent a capital gain. $0.38 of dividends paid per Series A preferred share
represent a capital gain.

NOTE 8.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are involved in various lawsuits and environmental matters arising in
the normal course of business. Management believes that such matters will not
have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

As
detailed at Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
—
Investment in Restaurant Joint Ventures at Santana Row,” we are currently
committed to invest approximately $8.0 million in these joint ventures. As of
December 31, 2003 we have invested approximately $7.8 million.

Under the terms of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement, from and
after January 1, 1986, an unaffiliated third
party, has the right to require us and the two other minority partners to
purchase from half to all of  its 37.5% interest in Congressional Plaza at the
interest’s then-current fair market value. Based on management’s current
estimate of fair market value, our estimated liability upon exercise of the put
option is approximately $28.0 million. In conjunction with the construction of
apartments at the property completed in 2003, we have agreed to
acquire 7.5% of the third party’s interest in Congressional Plaza, thereby lowering
its ownership percentage to 30%, in exchange for our funding approximately $7
million of its share of the redevelopment cost. The development funding has
taken place in 2003 and the acquisition of the third party’s 7.5% interest is anticipated
to be completed in 2004. After the completion of this transaction, our
estimated liability upon the exercise of the put option will be approximately
$21 million.

Under the terms of various other partnerships which own shopping center
properties with a cost of approximately $88.5 million, the partners may
exchange their 852,222 operating units for cash or the same number of our
common shares, at our option. On February 14, 2003 we paid $333,000 to redeem
12,000 operating units. On March 31, 2003 in connection with the acquisition
of Mount Vernon Plaza we issued approximately 120,000 operating units. On
April 3, 2003 we issued 64,952 of our common shares valued at $1.9 million in
exchange for 64,952

-F20-


operating units. On January 5, 2004 we paid $199,000 to redeem an
additional 5,100 operating units.

Under the terms of four other partnerships which own street retail
properties in southern California with a cost of approximately $61 million, if
certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the properties owned by the
partnerships, the other partners may require us to purchase their partnership
interests at a formula price based upon net operating income. The purchase
price may be paid in cash or for two of the partnerships, a limited number of
our common shares at the election of the other partners. In these partnerships,
if the other partners do not redeem their interest, we may choose to purchase
the limited partnership interests upon the same terms.

Street Retail San Antonio LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Trust,
entered into a Development Agreement (the “Agreement”) on March 13, 2000 with
the City of San Antonio, Texas (the “City”) related to the redevelopment of
land and buildings that we own along Houston Street in the City. Houston Street
and the surrounding area have been designated by the City as a Reinvestment
Zone (the “Zone”). The City has agreed to facilitate redevelopment of the Zone
by undertaking and financing certain public improvements based on our agreement
to redevelop our properties in the Zone. Under the terms of the Agreement, the
City issued debt to fund specific public improvements within the Zone. The
initial and primary source of funding to the City for repayment of the debt and
debt service is the incremental tax revenue that accretes to the City as the
taxable value of the redeveloped properties within the Zone increase. We are
required to issue an annual letter of credit, commencing on October 1, 2002
through September 30, 2014, that covers our designated portion of the debt
service should the incremental tax revenue generated in the Zone not cover the
debt service. We posted a letter of credit with the City on September 25, 2002
for $795,000. Our obligation under this Agreement is estimated to range from
$1.6 million to $3.0 million of which approximately $360,000 has been funded in
2003. We were not required to provide any funding in 2002 or for the
semi-annual payment due March 15, 2003. We have accrued for additional payments
of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2003 as part of the project costs due to
the estimated shortfall of incremental tax revenues to the City. We could be
required to provide funding beyond the $1.2 million currently accrued under the
Agreement prior to its expiration on September 30, 2014. We do not anticipate
that such obligation would exceed $600,000 in any year nor exceed $3 million
in total. If the Zone creates sufficient tax increment funding to repay the
City’s debt prior to the expiration of the Agreement, we will be eligible to
receive reimbursement of amounts paid for debt service shortfalls together with
interest thereon.

As of December 31, 2003 in connection with renovation and development
projects, the Trust has contractual obligations of approximately $79 million.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

In May 1999, we reorganized as a Maryland real estate investment trust by
amending and restating our declaration of trust and bylaws. The Amended
Declaration of Trust changed the number of authorized shares of common and
preferred shares from unlimited to 100,000,000 and 15,000,000, respectively.
In addition, all common shares of beneficial interest, no par value, which were
issued and outstanding were changed to common shares of beneficial interest,
$0.01 par value per share and all Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Shares of beneficial interest, no par value, which were issued and outstanding
were changed to Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of beneficial
interest, $0.01 par value per share.

On October 6, 1997 we issued four million 7.95% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares at $25 per share in a public offering, realizing
cash proceeds of approximately $96.6 million after costs of $3.4 million. The
Series A Preferred Shares were not redeemable prior to October 6, 2002. On
June 13, 2003, we redeemed these Preferred Shares using the proceeds from the
May 14, 2003 common stock offering and available funds. Dividends on the
Preferred Shares were payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of January,
April, July and October.

On November 19, 2001 we issued 5.4 million 8.5% Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares at $25 per share in a public offering, realizing
cash proceeds of approximately $130.2 million after costs of $4.8 million. The
Series B Preferred Shares are not redeemable prior to November 27, 2006. On or
after that date, the Preferred Shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at
our option, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus all accrued and unpaid
dividends. Dividends on the Preferred Shares are payable quarterly in arrears
on the last day of January, April, July and October.

On
June 12, 2002, we issued 2.2 million common shares at
$25.9825 per share
($27.35 gross, before a 5.00% underwriters discount and selling
concession) netting $56.6 million in cash proceeds after all
expenses of the offering.

On May 14, 2003, we issued 3.2 million common shares at $30.457 per share
($31.48 gross, before an aggregate 3.25% underwriters discount and selling
concession) netting $98.4 million in cash proceeds, after all expenses of the
offering.

We have a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, whereby shareholders may use their
dividends and optional cash payments to purchase shares. In 2003, 2002
and 2001, 109,835 shares, 134,247 shares and 159,234 shares, respectively, were
issued under the Plan.

-F22-


In December 1999, the Trustees authorized a share repurchase program for
calendar year 2000 of up to an aggregate of 4 million of our common shares.
During 2000, a total of 1,325,900 shares were repurchased, at a cost of $25.2
million. We did not repurchase shares in 2003, 2002 or 2001.

In 2003, 2002 and 2001, 138,568 common shares, 98,092 common shares and
96,657 common shares, respectively, were awarded to key employees,
including our former Chief Executive
Officer, under various incentive compensation programs
designed to directly link a significant portion of their current and long term
compensation to the prosperity of the Trust and its shareholders. The shares
vest over terms from 3 to 5 years. Vesting of common shares awarded to the
former Chief Executive Officer was accelerated pursuant to his contractual
arrangement.

On January 26, 1998, we granted 75,000 Performance Shares to an employee
for which vesting was tied to leasing performance as it relates to Santana Row
and other projects. Performance was to be measured at three separate dates
extending to 2003. By December 31, 2002, the first two performance measures had
been met. In connection with the restructuring (See Note 13) the 2003
performance measure was accelerated and granted as of December 31, 2002. We
applied variable accounting to these awards by valuing the shares at each date
the performance measures were either met or accelerated and recorded a charge
of $712,000 as part of the restructuring charge.

In February 2002 and February 2003, we granted Performance Awards of
30,000 and 120,000, respectively, to certain officers and employees of the
Trust. Pursuant to the terms of these awards, 20% of the Performance Shares
will vest for any calendar year in which we exceed certain performance targets
for the same period. Any performance awards which remain

-F23-


unvested after 2011 and 2012, respectively, will be forfeited. We employ
variable accounting for these Performance Awards. Compensation expense
resulting from this accounting was not material in 2002 or 2003.

Tax
loans with a balance of $300,000 in 2003, $1.8 million in 2002
and $3.1 million in 2001 have been made in connection with restricted share grants
to certain of our officers and in connection with the Share Purchase Plans. The
loans, which bear interest ranging from 1.95% to 6.54%, are due over periods
ranging from 8 to 13 years from the date of the loan. During 2003 tax loans in
the amount of $1.5 million were repaid.

On April 13, 1999, the Shareholder Rights Plan adopted in 1989 expired. On
March 11, 1999 we entered into an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement with
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, pursuant to which (i) the expiration
date of our shareholder rights plan was extended for an additional ten years to
April 24, 2009, (ii) the beneficial ownership percentage at which a person
becomes an “Acquiring Person” under the plan was reduced from 20% to 15%, and
(iii) certain other amendments were made. On October 29, 2003, we further
amended the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement to increase the beneficial
ownership percentage at which a person becomes an “Acquiring Person” under the
plan from 15% to 20% and to require that the Trust’s Board of Trustees review
the plan on a periodic basis.

NOTE 10

. STOCK OPTION PLAN

The 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”) authorizes the grant of options
and other stock based awards for up to 5.5 million shares. Options granted
under the Plan have ten year terms and vest in one to five years. The Plan
expired in May 2003.

In May 2001 our shareholders’ approved the 2001 Long Term Incentive Plan
(“2001 Plan”) which authorized an additional 1,750,000 shares for future option
and other stock based awards.

The option price to acquire shares under the 2001 Plan and previous plans
is required to be at least the fair market value at the date of grant. As a
result of the exercise of options, we had outstanding from our officers and
employees notes for $3.3 million, $2.5 million and $2.5 million at December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Notes issued after 2001 bear interest at
LIBOR plus a market-rate spread with the rate adjusted annually. Notes issued
prior to 2002 bear interest at the lesser of (i) our borrowing rate on the date
of exercise or (ii) the dividend rate on the date of exercise divided by the
purchase price of such shares. The notes issued under the previous plans bear
interest at the lesser of (i) our borrowing rate or (ii) the current indicated
annual dividend rate on the shares acquired pursuant to the option, divided by
the purchase price of such shares. The notes are collateralized by the shares
with recourse to the borrower and have five-year terms. Option awards made in
2001 and later do not provide for employees to be able to exercise their
options with a loan from the Trust.

SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” requires pro forma
information regarding net income and earnings per share as if we accounted for
our stock options under the fair value method of that Statement. Where at the
date of grant, either the number of shares or exercise price are not known, we
record compensation expense in accordance with variable accounting. The fair
value for options issued in 2003, 2002 and 2001 has been estimated as $582,000,
$536,000 and $350,000, respectively, as of the date of grant, using a

-F24-


Black Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions for
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 3.2%, 4.5% and
4.9%; volatility factors of the expected market price of our shares of 20%, 16%
and 20%; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 6.0 years, 6.9
years and 6.9 years. Our assumed weighted average dividend yield used to
estimate the fair value of the options issued was 8.85% in 2003.

Because option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, such as the expected stock price volatility, and because changes
in these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, the existing model may not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its stock options.

A summary of our stock option activity for the years ended December 31, is
as follows:

remaining contractual life of options outstanding at December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 was 6.3 years, 5.4 years and 5.8 years, respectively. The weighted
average grant date fair value per option for options granted in 2003, 2002 and
2001 was $1.32, $1.23 and $1.04, respectively. The exercise price of options
outstanding at December 31, 2003 ranged from $18.00 per share to $35.91 per
share.

NOTE 11

. SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLANS

We have a savings and retirement plan in accordance with the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. For employees who choose to
contribute, their contributions range, at their discretion, from 1% to 20% of
compensation up to a maximum of $11,000. Under the plan, we contribute out of
our current net income, 50% of each employee’s first 5% of contributions. In
addition, we may make discretionary contributions within the limits of
deductibility set forth by the Code. Our employees are immediately eligible to
become plan participants. Employees are not eligible to receive matching
contributions until their first

-F25-


anniversary of employment. Our expense for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 was $255,000, $271,000 and $243,000, respectively.

A nonqualified deferred compensation plan for our officers and certain
other employees was established in 1994. The plan allows the participants to
defer future income until the earlier of age 65 or termination of employment.
As of December 31, 2003, we are liable to participants for
approximately $3.2
million under this plan. Although this is an unfunded plan, we have purchased
certain investments with which to match this obligation. Our obligation under
this plan and the related investments are both included in the accompanying
financial statements.

NOTE 12

. INTEREST EXPENSE

We incurred interest totaling $88.7 million, $88.6 million and $87.1
million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, of which $13.5 million, $23.5
million, and $17.8 million respectively, was capitalized. Interest paid was
$85.7 million in 2003, $86.2 million in 2002 and $84.1 million in 2001.

NOTE 13.

CHANGE IN BUSINESS PLAN

On February 28, 2002, we adopted a new business plan which returned our
primary focus to our traditional business of acquiring and redeveloping
community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by supermarkets,
drug stores, or high volume, value oriented retailers that provide consumer
necessities. We will complete Bethesda Row and Santana Row (Pentagon Row was
completed in 2002) but do not plan to develop any new large-scale, mixed-use,
ground-up development projects. Rather, we will seek to acquire income
producing centers in and around our existing markets and will identify and execute
redevelopment opportunities in our existing portfolio. Concurrent with the
adoption of the business plan, we adopted a management succession plan and
restructured our management team.

In connection with this change in our business plan, we recorded a charge
of $18.2 million. This charge included a reserve for a restructuring charge of
$8.5 million made up of $6.9 million of severance and other compensation costs
for several of our senior officers related to the management restructuring, as
well as the write-off of $1.6 million of our development costs. All charges
against the reserve, totaling $8.5 million, were expended during 2002. An
additional component of the restructuring charge is an impairment loss of $9.7
million representing the estimated loss on the abandonment of development
projects held for sale, primarily the Tanasbourne development project located
in Washington County, Oregon, thereby adjusting the value of these assets to their
estimated fair value. The Tanasbourne land was sold in 2003 for approximately
$9.7 million resulting in a gain of $1.9 million.

On December 20, 2002, we announced the resignation of Steven J. Guttman as
Trustee, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Trustees
effective January 1, 2003. Donald C. Wood, our then President and Chief
Operating Officer, was named Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board
of Trustees. Mark Ordan, a member of the Board of Trustees since 1996, was
named non-executive chairman of the board. As a result of this transition, we
recorded a charge of $13.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for payments
and benefits to Mr. Guttman pursuant to his contractual arrangements with the
Trust and for other transition related costs. Of this amount, $7.9 million had
not been paid as of December 31, 2002 and $0.8 million remains
to be expended as of December 31, 2003.

NOTE 14

. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

Pursuant to the 2003 Incentive Bonus Plan, vice presidents and certain key
employees receive part of their 2003 bonus in our common shares which vest over
three years. Consequently, on February 12, 2004, 9,025 shares were awarded
under this plan. In addition, on February 12, 2004, 75,522 restricted shares
which will vest over three years were awarded to the Trust’s officers. All of
the restricted share awards were made under the 2001 Plan.

For Federal tax purposes, the aggregate tax basis is

No payments are delinquent on these mortgages.

2)

A $5.9 million loan receivable, which currently bears interest at 7.88% and is secured by an office building in San Francisco, California, was due February 28, 2003
but was not repaid on the due date. We are currently negotiating with the borrower to extend the loan until March 31, 2005. When the loan modification is complete,
the interest rate on the note will decrease to 6% retroactive to July 1, 2003. Interest on the loan is current through December 31, 2003 and based in part on the value of the underlying collateral, we believe that the loan is collectible and as such, no reserve has been established at this time.

3)

For the first five years interest is payable from cash flow, if available. If cash flow is not sufficient to pay interest in full,
the unpaid amount will accrue and bear interest at the same rate as the principal. After year five, current interest payments
are required. After year seven, mortgagee is required to apply 50% of all available cash flow to repayment of principal. In
March 2004, an additional $900,000 advance was made on this loan.

4)

This mortgage is available for up to $25,000,000.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Grant Thornton LLP has been selected as our independent public accountants
for the current year and examined our financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2003. On June 4, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP was dismissed and Grant
Thornton LLP was engaged as our principal independent public accountants. The
decision to change accountants was approved by the Board of Trustees upon the
recommendation of the Audit Committee. The reports of Arthur Andersen LLP for
the year ended December 31, 2001 and the subsequent interim period through
June 4, 2002 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor
were they qualified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and the subsequent interim
period through June 4, 2002, there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen
LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not
resolved to the satisfaction of Arthur Andersen LLP, would have caused them to
make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for those
periods.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive
Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the
definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
this report.

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting
during the period covered by this report that materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
