  PART I & II
  -----------

  Item 1.  Business
  -------  --------


    Federal Realty Investment Trust (the "Trust") is engaged in the ownership,
  management, development and redevelopment of prime retail properties.  Founded
  in 1962, the Trust is a self-administered equity real estate investment trust.
  The Trust consolidates the financial statements of various entities which it
  controls. At December 31, 1999 the Trust owned 123 retail or mixed use
  properties and one apartment complex.

    The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
  estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856- 860 of the Internal Revenue
  Code.  Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 95% of its real
  estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which
  meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its
  taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  Therefore, no
  provision for Federal income taxes is required.

    An important part of the Trust's strategy has been to acquire older, well-
  located  properties in prime, densely populated and affluent areas and to
  enhance their operating performance through a program of renovation,
  expansion, reconfiguration and retenanting.  The Trust's traditional focus has
  been on community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by
  supermarkets, drug stores or high volume, value oriented retailers that
  provide consumer necessities.  Late in 1994, recognizing a trend of consumer
  shopping preferences and retailer expansion to main streets, the Trust
  expanded its investment strategy to include shopping centers and retail and
  mixed use buildings in prime established main street shopping areas. In
  addition, since 1997 the Trust has obtained control of various land parcels
  for the purpose of developing urban mixed-use projects that center around the
  retail component. The Trust believes that these mixed use developments are an
  important source of its growth in the future.

    The Trust continually evaluates its properties for renovation, retenanting
  and expansion opportunities.  Similarly, the Trust regularly reviews its
  portfolio and from time to time considers selling properties that no longer
  fit the Trust's investment criteria and therefore should be monetized or
  exchanged into other real estate assets. Proceeds from the sale of such
  properties may be used either to acquire other properties (including funding
  for development) or to help fund the Trust's share repurchase programs.

    The Trust's portfolio of properties has grown from 54 as of January 1, 1995
  to 124 at December 31, 1999.  During this five year period the Trust acquired
  76 retail properties for approximately $651 million.  During this same period
  six



  shopping centers were sold.  Also during this period the Trust spent over
  $308 million to develop, renovate, expand, improve and retenant its
  properties.  Although the Trust usually purchases  a 100% fee interest in its
  acquisitions, on occasion, it has entered into leases as a means of acquiring
  properties.  In addition, the Trust has purchased certain properties in
  partnership with others.  Certain of the partnerships, known as "downreit
  partnerships", are a means of allowing property owners to make a tax deferred
  contribution of their property in exchange for partnership units, which
  receive the same distributions as Trust common shares and may be convertible
  into common shares of the Trust.  The majority of acquisitions are funded with
  cash, but, on occasion, usually in connection with the partnerships, debt
  financing is used. Since a significant portion of cash provided by operating
  activities is distributed to common and preferred shareholders, capital
  outlays for acquisitions, developments and redevelopments require debt or
  equity funding.

    The Trust's 124 properties are located in fifteen states and the District of
  Columbia.  Twenty-six of the properties  are located in the  Washington, D.C.
  metropolitan area; twenty-four are in California; fourteen are in Connecticut;
  ten are in Pennsylvania, primarily in the Philadelphia area; ten are in New
  Jersey; twelve are in Texas; seven are in Illinois; three are in Virginia;
  four are in Massachusetts; seven are in New York; two are in Florida; two are
  in Arizona;  and there is one in each of the following states:  Michigan,
  North Carolina and Oregon.  No single property accounts for over 10% of the
  Trust's revenues.

    The Trust has traditionally operated its business as a single business
  segment.  During the fourth quarter of 1998, however, the Trust completed a
  comprehensive restructuring program which, among other things, changed the
  Trust's operating structure from a functional hierarchy to an asset management
  model, where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets.
  As a result the Trust has divided its portfolio of properties into three
  operating regions: the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West. Each region is
  operated under the direction of a regional chief operating officer, with
  dedicated leasing, property management and financial staff and operates
  largely autonomously with respect to day to day operating decisions. (See
  "Segment Results" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
  Condition and Results of Operations for a further discussion of the segments
  and their results.)

    The Trust has approximately 2,200 tenants, ranging from sole proprietors to
  major national retailers; no one tenant or corporate group of tenants accounts
  for 2% or more of revenue.  The Trust's leases with these tenants are
  classified as operating leases and typically are structured to include minimum
  rents, percentage rents based on tenants' gross sales volumes and
  reimbursement of certain operating expenses and real estate taxes.



    The Trust continues to seek older, well-located shopping centers and retail
  buildings to acquire, renovate, retenant and remerchandise, thereby enhancing
  their revenue potential. The Trust also continues to identify and secure
  additional sites for new development.  During each of the years ended December
  31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, retail or mixed-use properties have contributed 96%
  of the Trust's total revenue. The extent to which the Trust might mortgage or
  otherwise finance investments varies with the investment involved and the
  economic climate.

    The success of the Trust depends upon, among other factors, the trends of
  the economy, access to capital, interest rates, construction costs, retailing
  trends, income tax laws, increases or decreases in operating expenses,
  governmental regulations, population trends, zoning laws, legislation and the
  ability of the Trust to keep its properties leased at profitable levels.  The
  Trust competes for tenants with other real estate owners and the Trust's
  properties account for only a small fraction of the retail space available for
  lease.  The Trust competes for investment opportunities and debt and equity
  capital with individuals, partnerships, corporations, financial institutions,
  life insurance companies, pension funds, trust funds and other real estate
  investment trusts.

       Investments in real property create a potential for environmental
  liability on the part of the current and previous owners of, or any mortgage
  lender on, such real property.  If hazardous substances are discovered on or
  emanating from any property, the owner or operator of the property may be held
  liable for costs and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances.  The
  Trust has environmental insurance on many of its properties.  Subject to
  certain exclusions and deductibles, the insurance provides coverage for
  unidentified, pre-existing conditions and for future contamination caused by
  tenants and third parties.    The Trust's current policy is to require an
  environmental study on each property it seeks to acquire.  On recent
  acquisitions, any substances identified prior to closing which are required,
  by applicable laws, to be remediated have been or are in the process of
  investigation and remediation. Costs related to the abatement of asbestos
  which increase the value of Trust properties are capitalized. Other costs are
  expensed.  In 1999 and 1998 approximately $952,000 and $616,000, respectively,
  of which $654,000 and $453,000, respectively, was capitalized abatement costs,
  was spent on environmental matters.  The Trust has budgeted approximately
  $650,000 in 2000 for environmental matters, a majority of which is projected
  for asbestos abatement.

  Current Developments
  --------------------

    In May 1999 the Trust, which had been founded as a District of Columbia
  business trust in 1962, reorganized as a Maryland real estate investment trust
  by amending and restating its declaration of trust and bylaws.



   During 1999 while exploring strategic alternatives to   maximize shareholder
 value, the Trust considered spinning off certain of its assets (primarily those
 related to the development and operation of its main street retail program) in
 a taxable transaction to shareholders.  Shortly thereafter, the remaining
 assets of the Trust were to be merged with another publicly traded shopping
 center company in exchange for cash and stock consideration.  On September 24,
 1999, the Trust announced that merger negotiations were terminated and that the
 spin-off was being reevaluated.

   In preparing for these transactions, the Trust incurred expenses of
 approximately $2.8 million related to legal, accounting, tax and other advisory
 services related to the proposed spin-off and the merger.  Such costs have been
 expensed and are reflected as administrative expenses in the accompanying
 consolidated statement of operations.  While management continues to evaluate
 alternatives to maximize shareholder value, there are currently no plans to
 consummate a spin-off or merger transaction.

    In 1999, $26.4 million of real estate, consisting of three street retail
  properties, was acquired.  Improvements to properties totalled $95.1 million,
  including $38.7 million on  predevelopment and development projects in
  Bethesda, Maryland; Los Gatos, California; San Jose, California; San Antonio,
  Texas; and Arlington, Virginia.  The Trust invested $2.3 million in mortgage
  notes receivable with an average weighted stated interest rate of 10%.
  Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia was sold in October 1999 for $19.6
  million, resulting in a loss of $6.3 million.

    The Trust utilized its unsecured line of credit to fund these acquisitions
  and capital expenditures.  Repayments on the line of credit were made from the
  proceeds of the sale of Northeast Plaza as well as the issuance on November
  30, 1999 of $175 million of 8.75% Senior Notes due December 1, 2009.

    In December 1999 the Trustees authorized a share repurchase program of up to
  an aggregate of 4 million of the Trust's common shares.  The repurchase
  program will end upon the earlier of December 31, 2000 or the date when the
  repurchase limit has been met.  As of December 31, 1999, 140,400 shares had
  been repurchased, at a cost of $2.6 million.  As of March 14, 2000, 1,048,600
  shares at a cost of $20.0 million had been repurchased.

       At December 31, 1999 the Trust had 192 full-time employees.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data.
         -----------------------

In thousands, except per share data






(1) Determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows.


(2) Defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
(NAREIT) as income available for common shareholders before  depreciation and
amortization of real estate assets and before extraordinary items and
significant nonrecurring events less gains on sale of real estate.  Effective
January 1, 2000 funds from operation will no longer exclude significant
nonrecurring events. Funds from operations differs from net cash provided by
operating activities primarily because funds from operations does not include
changes in operating assets and liabilities.  Funds from operations is a
supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a
measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure
of liquidity.  Nevertheless, funds from operations, as presented by the Trust,
may not be comparable to funds from operations as presented by other real estate
investment trusts.



The calculation of funds from operations for the periods presented
is reflected in the following table:

  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto of Federal Realty Investment Trust (the
"Trust").  The Trust and its representatives may from time to time make written
or oral statements that are "forward-looking", within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements contained in this
report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in
reports to the Trust's shareholders.  Such forward-looking statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual
strategic initiatives, results, performance or achievements of the Trust to be
materially different from the initiatives,  results of operations or plans
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Such factors include,
among others, changes in the Trust's business strategy, general economic and
business conditions which will affect credit-worthiness of tenants, financing
availability and cost, retailing trends and rental rates; risks of real estate
development and acquisitions;  governmental and environmental regulations; and
competition with other real estate companies and technology.

  The Trust is engaged in the ownership, management, development and
redevelopment of prime retail properties. The Trust, which has traditionally
invested in strip retail shopping centers, has expanded its investments to urban
mixed used properties.   Management continually evaluates the future prospects
of its  real estate portfolio, not only to identify expansion and renovation
opportunities, but also to identify properties that no longer fit the Trust's
investment criteria and therefore, should be monetized or exchanged into other
real estate assets. At December 31, 1999 the Trust owned 123 retail properties
and one apartment complex.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

  The Trust meets its liquidity requirements through net cash provided by
operating activities, along with traditional debt and equity funding
alternatives available to it. A significant portion of cash provided by
operating activities is distributed to common and preferred shareholders in the
form of dividends.  Accordingly, capital outlays for property acquisitions,
major renovation and development projects and balloon debt repayments require
debt or equity funding. The Trust also expects proceeds from the sale of
selected assets to provide an additional source of capital in 2000 and 2001.

  Net cash provided by operating activities was $102.2 million in 1999,  $90.4
million in 1998, and $72.2 million in 1997, of which $76.6 million, $74.3
million, and $62.6 million, respectively, was distributed to shareholders.
Contributions from newly acquired properties and from retenanted and redeveloped
properties, as more fully described below, were the primary sources of these
increases.

  Net cash used in investing activities was $99.3 million in 1999, $187.6
million in 1998, and $279.3 million in 1997. The Trust



acquired properties totaling $26.4 million in 1999, $120.4 million in 1998, and
$275.2 million in 1997 requiring cash outlays of $25.3 million, $92.9 million,
and $251.4 million. During these same three years the Trust expended an
additional $90.8 million, $73.0 million, and $50.3 million in capital
improvements to its properties, of which $38.7 million in 1999 and $25.0 million
in 1998 related to new development (1997 amounts related to new development were
insignificant). The Trust invested $2.3 million, $21.4 million, and $10.4
million in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively, in mortgage notes receivable,
with an average weighted stated interest rate of 10%, 10% and 9%, respectively.
Certain of these mortgages also participate in the gross revenues and
appreciation and are convertible into ownership interests in the properties by
which they are secured. Cash of $19.2 million in 1999 and $9.4 million in 1997
was received from the sale of properties.

  During 1999 the Trust expended cash of $25.3 million to acquire real estate
and an additional $90.8 million to improve, redevelop and develop its existing
real estate.  The Trust acquired a ninety percent interest in three buildings,
valued at $26.4 million, in Hollywood, California for a total cash investment to
the Trust of $23.7 million.  The first two buildings have 122,000 and 64,000
leasable square feet, respectively.  The third building is vacant pending
redevelopment.  In addition, the Trust increased by $1.6 million its partnership
interest in Kings Court in Los Gatos, California.

  Of the $90.8 million spent in 1999 on the Trust's existing real estate
portfolio, approximately $38.7 million was invested in predevelopment and
development projects in Bethesda, Maryland; Los Gatos, California; San Jose,
California; San Antonio, Texas; and in Arlington, Virginia.  The remaining $52.1
million of  capital expenditures relates to improvements to common areas, tenant
work and  various redevelopments, including the renovation of Gratiot Plaza, the
expansion and retenanting of Langhorne Square shopping center, the renovation of
Blue Star shopping center, and the redevelopment of  retail buildings in Forest
Hills, New York.

  Net cash provided by financing activities, before dividend payments, was $68.3
million in 1999, $171.7 million in 1998, and $275.8 million in 1997.  The Trust
utilized its unsecured line of credit to initially fund acquisitions, capital
expenditures and balloon debt repayments.

  In December 1998 the Trust obtained a four-year loan of $125 million from five
institutional lenders. The loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis
points, had an average weighted interest cost in 1999 of 6.1%.  In addition, the
loan requires fees and has the same covenants as the syndicated credit facility.
Proceeds were used to repay amounts drawn on the syndicated credit facility.

   In December 1997 the Trust replaced its unsecured medium-term revolving
credit facilities with four banks with a five-year syndicated credit facility,
thereby increasing the aggregate amount available from $135 million to $300
million and decreasing the interest rate from LIBOR plus 75 basis points to
LIBOR plus 65 basis points. As did prior credit facilities, the syndicated
facility



requires fees and has various covenants including the maintenance of a minimum
shareholders' equity and a maximum ratio of debt to net worth. At December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997, $34.0 million, $134.1 million, and $114.8 million,
respectively, was borrowed under these facilities. The maximum amount borrowed
during 1999, 1998, and 1997 was $205.0 million, $259.1 million, and $114.8
million. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings during 1999, 1998 and
1997 was 5.9%, 6.1%, and 6.5%, respectively. Repayments on the credit facilities
were made from the following debt and equity issuances.

  On November 30, 1999 the Trust issued $175 million of 8.75% Notes due December
1, 2009, netting cash proceeds of $172.2 million. The notes pay interest semi-
annually on June 1 and December 1.

  On March 5, 1998 the Trust issued $39.5 million of 6.74% Medium-Term Notes due
2004, netting approximately $39.3 million, and $40.5 million of 6.99% Medium-
Term Notes due 2006, netting approximately $40.2 million.  The notes pay
interest semi-annually on March 30 and September 30.

  In order to minimize the risk of changes in interest rates, from time to time
in connection with the issuance of certain debt issues the Trust will enter into
interest rate hedge agreements.  In anticipation of the March 1998 Medium-Term
Note issuance, the Trust purchased a Treasury Yield Hedge (notional amount of
$50 million) on January 13, 1998 which was terminated on March 5, 1998 at a gain
of $1.1 million.  The gain is being recognized as a reduction in interest
expense over the terms of the notes.  There were no open hedge agreements at
December 31, 1999 and 1998.

  In December 1999 the Trustees authorized a share repurchase program of up to
an aggregate of 4 million of the Trust's common shares.  The repurchase program
will end upon the earlier of December 31, 2000 or the date when the repurchase
limit has been met.  As of December 31, 1999, 140,500 shares had been
repurchased at a cost of $2.6 million.  As of March 14, 2000, 1,048,600 common
shares at a cost of $20.0 million had been repurchased.

  On February 4, 1997 the Trust sold three million common shares to an
institutional investor for $28 per share, netting $83.9 million. On July 29,
1997 the Trust sold $40 million of 6.82% Medium-Term Notes, netting
approximately $39.8 million.  On October 6, 1997 the Trust issued four million
7.95% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at $25 per share in a
public offering, netting approximately $96.8 million.

  Capital requirements in 2000 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, new
development efforts, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing
properties, and the success of the share repurchase program.  The Trust has
budgeted approximately $150 million for 2000 for new development and $61 million
for redevelopments, tenant work and improvements to the core portfolio.

  The Trust's long term debt has varying maturity dates and in a number of
instances includes balloon payments or other contractual provisions that could
require significant repayments during a particular period.  The Trust's $100
million of 8 7/8% Senior Notes matured on January 17, 2000 and were paid with
borrowings on the



revolving credit facility. The next significant maturity is of
$30.7 million of mortgage debt in 2001.

   The Trust will need additional capital in order to fund  acquisitions,
expansions, developments, refinancings and its share repurchase program.
Sources of this funding may be additional debt, both secured and unsecured;
additional equity; proceeds from the sale of properties; and joint venture
relationships.  The timing and choice of capital sources will depend on the cost
and availability of that capital, among other things. The cost of unsecured debt
is partially dependent upon the Trust's debt ratings. Moody's Investors Service
lowered its rating on the Trust's senior unsecured debt from Baa1 to Baa2 in
November 1999 while Standard and Poor's affirmed its rating of BBB+.  In January
2000 the Trust obtained a construction loan commitment for up to $24.5 million
in connection with the Trust's Woodmont East development in Bethesda, Maryland.
The Trust believes, based on past experience, that access to the capital needed
to execute its business plan will be available to it.

Contingencies
- -------------

  The Trust is involved in various lawsuits and environmental matters arising in
the normal course of business. Management believes that such matters will not
have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
the Trust.

  Pursuant to the provisions of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement,
in the event of the exercise of put options by another partner, the Trust would
be required to purchase a 37.5% interest at Congressional Plaza at its then fair
market value.  Based on management's current estimate of fair market value, the
Trust's estimated cash requirement upon exercise of the put option is
approximately $27 million.

  On January 1, 1999 the Loehmann's Plaza Limited Partnership Agreement was
amended to extend the partnership to December 31, 2000 and to delete the put and
call options.  On January 1, 2000 the partnership agreement was again amended
and restated.  Under this amended and restated agreement, the limited partner
was awarded 190,000 partnership units in exchange for a 98% partnership
interest.

  Under the terms of certain other partnerships, if certain leasing and revenue
levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships,  the limited
partners may require the Trust to purchase their partnership interests at a
formula price based upon net operating income.  The purchase price may be paid
in cash or common shares of the Trust, at the election of the limited partners.
If the limited partners do not redeem their interest, the Trust may choose to
purchase the limited partnership interests upon the same terms.

  Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Loehmann's Plaza Limited
Partnership Agreement and certain other partnerships, the partners may exchange
their operating partnership units, totaling 1,004,589, into cash or the same
number of common shares of the Trust, at the option of the Trust. During the
third quarter of 1999 the Trust redeemed 64,952 operating units for cash of $1.6
million.



  As of December 31, 1999 in connection with renovation and development
projects, the Trust has contractual obligations of $59 million.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

  Net income and funds from operations have been affected by the Trust's recent
acquisition, redevelopment and financing activities. The Trust has historically
reported its funds from operations in addition to its net income and net cash
provided by operating activities.  Funds from operations is a supplemental
measure of real estate companies' operating performance.  The National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines funds from
operations as follows: income available for common shareholders before
depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and before extraordinary
items and significant non-recurring events less gains on sale of real estate.
Effective January 1, 2000 funds from operations will no longer exclude
significant nonrecurring events.  Funds from operations does not replace net
income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities
as a measure of liquidity.  Rather, funds from operations has been adopted by
real estate investment trusts to provide a consistent measure of operating
performance in the industry.  Nevertheless, funds from operations, as presented
by the Trust, may not be comparable to funds from operations as presented by
other real estate investment trusts.

  The reconciliation of net income to funds from operations is as follows (in
thousands):


  The Trust's retail leases generally provide for minimum rents with periodic
increases.  Most retail tenants pay a majority of on-site operating expenses and
real estate taxes.  Many leases also contain a percentage rent clause which
calls for additional rents based on gross tenant sales.  These features in the
Trust leases reduce the Trust's exposure to higher costs caused by inflation and
allow it to participate in improved tenant sales.



Consolidated Results
- --------------------

1999 vs. 1998

  Rental income, which consists of minimum rent, percentage rent and cost
recoveries, increased 11%  from $222.2 million in 1998 to $245.8 million in
1999.  If properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998 are excluded, rental
income increased 6%,with the recently renovated and retenanted centers
contributing heavily to the growth.

  Other property income includes items, which, although recurring, tend to
fluctuate from period to period, such as utility reimbursements, telephone
income, merchant association dues, late fees, and temporary income.  Also
included are less regularly recurring items, such as lease termination fees.
Other income increased 9% from $10.3 million in 1998 to $11.2 million in 1999.
An increase of $650,000 in temporary tenant income, an area identified by the
Trust as one with additional growth opportunity, and an increase of $550,000 in
lease termination fees surpassed decreases in telephone income and decreases in
marketing dues, as the Trust discontinued marketing funds at certain shopping
centers in 1999.

  Rental expenses increased 8% from $49.5 million in 1998 to $53.7 million in
1999.  If properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998 are excluded, rental
expenses increased 5%.  A $1.2 million increase in the write off of tenant work
and lease costs associated with bankrupt or terminated leases coupled with a
$975,000 increase in snow removal costs offset the decrease in marketing
expenses,  consistent with the decrease in marketing dues.

  Real estate taxes increased 7% from $23.3 million in 1998 to $25.0 million in
1999.  If properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998 are excluded, real
estate taxes increased 4%, primarily due to increased taxes on recently
redeveloped properties.

  Depreciation and amortization expense increased 9% from $46.0 million in 1998
to $50.0 million in 1999. If properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998 are
excluded, depreciation and amortization expense increased 7% due to the impact
of recent tenant work and redevelopments.

  Interest income increased 29% from $5.9 million in 1998 to $7.6 million in
1999 due primarily to the issuance of approximately $24 million of mortgage
notes receivable in 1999 and 1998.

  In 1999 the Trust incurred interest expense of $68.4 million, of which $6.9
million was capitalized, as compared to 1998's $60.2 million, of which $5.1
million was capitalized.  The increase in interest expense reflects the
additional debt issued to help fund the Trust's 1999 real estate acquisitions
and capital improvements of approximately $116 million.  The weighted average
interest rate was 7.6% in 1999 compared with 8% in 1998.  The ratio of earnings
to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends was 1.52x in 1999 and 1.46x in
1998. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.70x in 1999 and 1.65x in
1998.  The ratio of funds from operations to combined fixed charges and
preferred dividends was 2.40x in 1999 and



2.46x in 1998. The combination of higher leverage with low interest rates has
positively impacted the Trust's net income and funds from operations, on a per
share basis.

  Administrative expenses decreased from $16.5 million in 1998 to $15.1 million
in 1999. Both years contained unusual expenses.  During the third quarter of
1998, the Trust recorded a $4.7 million charge related to a comprehensive
restructuring program. During the third quarter of 1999, the Trust, in exploring
strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, considered spinning off
certain of its assets and merging the remaining assets with another publicly
traded shopping center company.  The Trust incurred expenses of approximately
$2.8 million in connection with this proposed merger and spin-off which were not
consummated. In addition, costs related to abandoned acquisition and development
projects increased approximately $1.5 million in 1999 over 1998.

  Investors' share of operations represents the minority interest in the income
of certain properties.  One third of the increase from $3.1 million in 1998 to
$3.9 million in 1999 is due to the income attributable to the operating
partnership units issued upon the acquisition of Kings Court and Leesburg Plaza
in the second half of 1998. The majority of the remaining increase represents
the minority partners' share of the increased earnings in the southern
California street retail assets, many of which have been redeveloped during 1998
and 1999.

  As a result of the foregoing items, net income before loss on the sale of real
estate increased from $48.1 million in 1998 to $59.4 million in 1999, reflecting
both the contribution to net income from the Trust's acquisitions and the
contribution from the core portfolio, primarily the recently redeveloped and
retenanted properties.

  During the second quarter of 1999, the Trust recorded a $7.1 million charge,
representing the estimated loss on the potential sale of certain assets,
principally Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia.  On October 18, 1999 the Trust
sold Northeast Plaza for $19.6 million, realizing a loss of $6.3 million.
Consequently, net income increased from $45.0 million in 1998 to $48.4 million
in 1999 with net income available for common shareholders increasing from $37.0
million in 1998 to $40.5 million in 1999.

  While the Trust expects growth in 2000 in funds from operations, the growth
may be less than in 1999. Growth in 1999 was fueled by contributions from 1998
acquisitions, by higher leverage combined with low interest rates, by savings
from the 1998 restructuring and by growth in the core portfolio. There were no
significant income producing acquisitions in 1999 to fuel 2000 growth; there
will be no significant contribution in 2000 from the Trust's development
projects and the savings from the 1998 restructuring have already been realized.
Consequently, the growth in 2000 is primarily dependent on contributions from
the core portfolio. Growth of net income from the core portfolio is, in part,
dependent on controlling expenses, some of which are beyond the complete control
of the Trust, such as snow removal and trends in the retailing environment, such
as the evolution of the Internet and demand for retail space.



The Trust currently expects that demand for its retail space should remain at
levels similar to those in 1999. A weakening of the retail environment could,
however, adversely impact the Trust by increasing vacancies and decreasing
rents. In past weak retail and real estate environments, the Trust has been able
to replace weak and bankrupt tenants with stronger tenants; management believes
that due to the quality of the Trust's properties there will continue to be
demand for its space.

  Growth in net income is also dependent on the amount of leverage and interest
rates.  The Trust is currently exploring various options for financing its
development pipeline and other capital needs.  This recapitalization will result
in interest rates higher than the Trust's current rates. In addition, the Trust
will continue to have exposure to changes in market interest rates.      As
interest rates increase, net income and funds from operations, as well as the
ultimate cost of the Trust's development projects will be negatively impacted
due to the variable interest rates on the Trust's revolving credit facilities.

1998 vs. 1997

  Rental income, which consists of minimum rent, percentage rent and cost
recoveries, increased 18%  from $188.5 million in 1997 to  $222.2 million in
1998.  If properties acquired and sold in 1998 and 1997 are excluded, rental
income increased 5%, due primarily to the favorable impact of redeveloped and
retenanted centers and to higher percentage rent.

  Other property income includes items which, although recurring, tend to
fluctuate from period to period, such as utility reimbursements, telephone
income, merchant association dues, late fees, and temporary tenant income.  Also
included are less regularly recurring items, such as lease termination fees.
Other income increased 6% from $9.7 million in 1997 to $10.3 million in 1998 due
to contributions from the 1998 and 1997 acquisitions, which were partly offset
by a $1.3 million decrease in lease termination fees.

  Rental expenses increased 16% from $42.8 million in 1997 to $49.5 million in
1998, due to the 1998 and 1997 acquisitions.  If rental expenses are adjusted
for properties acquired and sold in 1998 and 1997, rental expenses are constant
at $40.6 million.  Decreases in environmental expenses and common area expenses
such as snow removal were offset by increases in bad debt expense which had been
unusually low in 1997 due to the recovery in 1997 of amounts written off in
prior years.

  Real estate taxes increased 19% from $19.5 million in 1997 to $23.3 million in
1998, due to the 1998 and 1997 acquisitions.  If real estate taxes are adjusted
for properties acquired and sold in 1998 and 1997, real estate taxes increased
5% due primarily to increased taxes on recently redeveloped properties.

  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 11% from $41.4 million in
1997 to $46.0 million in 1998 reflecting the impact of properties acquired in
1998 and 1997 and of  recent tenant work and property improvements.



  In 1998 the Trust incurred interest expense of $60.2 million, of which $5.1
million was capitalized, as compared to 1997's $50.9 million, of which $3.6
million was capitalized.  The increase in interest expense reflects the
additional debt issued to fund the Trust's approximately $200 million of real
estate investments made in 1998.  The weighted average interest rate was 8% in
1998 compared with 8.5% in 1997.  The ratio of earnings to combined fixed
charges and preferred dividends was 1.46x in 1998 and 1.64x in 1997. The ratio
of earnings to fixed charges was 1.65x in 1998 and 1.70x in 1997. The ratio of
funds from operations to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends was
2.46x in 1998 and 2.50x in 1997.

  Administrative expenses in 1998 reflect the adoption of the  Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") Issue 97-11, which requires the expensing of internal costs
of acquisition activities beginning in late March 1998.  Prior to this date,
such costs were capitalized as a component of the basis of the acquired asset.
The increase in administrative expenses from $9.8 million in 1997  to $11.8
million in 1998 is substantially due to its adoption.

  Administrative expenses in 1998 included reorganization expenses of $4.7
million representing a one time charge recorded in the third quarter related to
a comprehensive restructuring program. The charge included a provision for
employee severance and related costs, office closing and downsizing expenses, as
well as legal and consulting fees related to the restructuring program.  The
Trust's workforce was reduced by approximately 15% including several vice
presidents and other senior personnel.  The foundation of the restructuring
effort focused on a change in the Trust's operating model from a functional
hierarchy to an asset management discipline where small focused teams are
responsible for and compensated based on the operating performance of a
portfolio of assets.  In addition, the restructuring effort included a
significant downsizing of the Trust's acquisition department, in response to
changing market conditions and business emphasis.  In 1997 the Trust incurred
$2.0 million of costs associated with severance and other expenses related to
changes in the Trust's executive management.

  Investors' share of operations represents the minority interest in the income
of certain properties. The increase from $1.3 million in 1997 to $3.1 million in
1998 was primarily due to the income attributable to the operating partnership
units issued upon the acquisition of Courthouse, Magruder's, Kings Court and
Leesburg Plaza shopping centers in late 1997 and 1998 and due to the minority
partners' share of the increased earnings in Congressional Plaza.

  As a result of the foregoing items, net income before gain on sale of real
estate increased from $40.1 million in 1997 to $45.0 million in 1998, reflecting
not only the contribution to net income from the Trust's acquisitions, but also
the contribution from improved results of the core portfolio.  Net income,
including gain on sale of real estate, decreased from $46.5 million in 1997 to
$45.0 million in 1998.  In 1997 three shopping centers were sold at a net gain
of $6.4 million.  Net income available for common shareholders decreased from
$44.6 million in 1997 to $37.0 million in 1998, due to a full year of preferred
dividends in 1998 of $8.0 million compared with a partial year in 1997 of $1.9
million since



the $100 million of 7.95% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares were
issued in October 1997.


Segment Results
- ---------------

        The Trust has traditionally operated its business as a single business
segment. During the fourth quarter of 1998, however, the Trust completed a
comprehensive restructuring program which, among other things, changed the
Trust's operating structure from a functional hierarchy to an asset management
model, where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets. As a
result the Trust has divided its portfolio of properties into three geographic
operating regions:  Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West.  Each region is operated
under the direction of a chief operating officer, with dedicated leasing,
property management and financial staff and operates largely autonomously with
respect to day to day operating decisions.  Incentive compensation, throughout
the regional teams, is tied to the net operating income of the respective
portfolios.  In 1999 there was a minor reorganization of the regions which moved
the Illinois and Michigan properties to the Northeast region from the Western
region.


  Historical operating results for the three regions are as follows (in
thousands):


The Northeast

  The Northeast region is comprised of 53 assets, extending from suburban
Philadelphia north to New York and its suburbs into New England and west to
Illinois and Michigan.  A significant portion of this portfolio has been held by
the Trust for many years although acquisitions, redevelopment and retenanting
remain major components to the current and future performance of the region.
Several redevelopment projects are currently underway which are expected to add
to revenues and net operating income in 2000 and future years.

  When comparing 1999 with 1998, rental income increased 9% from



$93.6 million in 1998 to $102.5 million in 1999.  Excluding properties acquired
during the two periods, rental income increased 7%, driven by increases at the
recently redeveloped and retenanted Brick, Feasterville, Gratiot, Huntington,
and Wynnewood shopping centers.

  Net operating income increased 12% from $66.4 million in 1998 to $74.3 million
in 1999.  Excluding properties acquired in 1998 and 1999, net operating income
increased 9%, primarily due to increases at the recently redeveloped and
retenanted Brick, Feasterville, Gratiot, Huntington, and Wynnewood shopping
centers.

  When comparing 1998 with 1997, rental income increased 17% from $80.3 million
in 1997 to  $93.6 million in 1998.  Excluding properties acquired and sold in
1998 and 1997, rental income increased 5%, driven by increases at the recently
redeveloped and retenanted Brick, Crossroads, Gratiot, Troy and Wynnewood
shopping centers.

  Net operating income increased 17% from $56.8 million in 1997 to $66.4 million
in 1998.  Excluding properties acquired in 1998 and 1997, net operating income
increased 8%, primarily due to increases at the recently redeveloped and
retenanted Brick, Crossroads, Gratiot, Troy and Wynnewood shopping centers.


The Mid-Atlantic

  The Mid-Atlantic region is comprised of 31 assets,  extending from Baltimore
south to metropolitan Washington D.C. and further south through Virginia and
North Carolina into Florida.  As with the Northeast region, a significant
portion of this portfolio has been held by the Trust for many years although
acquisitions, redevelopment and retenanting remain major components to its
current and future performance.  One redevelopment project is currently underway
in this region and two of the Trust's major new development projects, Pentagon
Row and additional phases of Bethesda Row, will be managed by this regional
operating team upon their completion.

  When comparing 1999 with 1998, rental income increased 8% from $103.7 million
in 1998 to $111.6 million in 1999.  Excluding properties acquired and sold in
1999 and 1998, rental income increased 5%.  Net operating income increased 7%
from $76.1 million in 1998 to $81.2 million in 1999.  Excluding properties
acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998, net operating income increased 3%.

  When comparing 1998 with 1997, rental income increased 7% from $96.8 million
in 1997 to $103.7 million in 1998.  Excluding properties acquired and sold in
1998 and 1997, rental income increased 4%, in large part due to increases at
Bethesda Row and new anchors at Barracks Road and Mid-Pike Plaza shopping
centers.

  Net operating income increased 7% from $71.3 million in 1997 to $76.1 million
in 1998.  Excluding properties acquired and sold in 1998 and 1997, net operating
income increased 3%.



The West

  The Western region is comprised of 39 assets, extending from Texas to the West
Coast.  Unlike the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, this portfolio is
relatively new to the Trust and is part of a deliberate expansion west over the
past several years. This region is the fastest growing at the Trust and such
major new development projects as Santana Row in San Jose and Houston Street in
San Antonio will be managed by this regional operating team upon their
completion.  Several redevelopment projects are currently underway, particularly
in southern California, which are expected to add to revenues and net operating
income in 2000 and future years.


  When comparing 1999 with 1998, rental income increased 28% from $24.9 million
in 1998 to $31.8 million in 1999.  Excluding properties acquired in 1999 and
1998, rental income increased 11%, driven by the recent redevelopment of Old
Town in Los Gatos and several street retail buildings in southern California.

  Net operating income increased 31% from $17.3 million in 1998 to $22.7 million
in 1999.  Excluding properties acquired in 1999 and 1998, net operating income
increased 14%, driven by the recent redevelopment of Old Town in Los Gatos and
several street retail buildings in southern California.

  When comparing 1998 with 1997, rental income increased 118% from $11.4 million
in 1997 to $24.9 million in 1998. Excluding properties acquired in 1998 and
1997, rental income increased 30%, driven by the redevelopment and retenanting
of several street retail buildings in southern California.

  Net operating income increased 122% from $7.8 million in 1997 to $17.3 million
in 1998. Excluding properties acquired and sold, net operating income increased
27% from $3.6 million in 1997 to $4.6 million in 1998.  This increase resulted
from the redevelopment and retenanting  of several street retail buildings in
southern California.

Independent Public Accountants
- ------------------------------

  On May 5, 1999, the Trust appointed the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen LLP
as independent public accountants to replace Grant Thornton LLP, which was
dismissed effective the same date.  The Trust's Board of Trustees approved the
decision to change independent public accountants upon the recommendation of the
Trust's Audit Committee.  During the Trust's fiscal years ended December 31,
1998 and 1997 and interim period through March 31, 1999 there were no
disagreements with Grant Thornton LLP on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.  The
reports issued by Grant Thornton LLP on the financial statements for the years
ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of
opinion, and were not qualified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles.

  During the Trust's  fiscal years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 and interim
period through March 31, 1999, the Trust has not



consulted with Arthur Andersen LLP regarding the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, the type of audit opinion that might be
rendered on the Trust's financial statements, or any matter that was either the
subject of a disagreement or a reportable event.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Trust's primary financial market risk is the fluctuation in interest
rates.  At December 31, 1999,  the Trust had $168.4 million of variable rate
debt. Based upon this balance of variable debt, if interest rates increased 1%,
the Trust's earnings and cash flows would decrease by $1.7 million.  If interest
rates decreased 1%, the Trust's earnings and cash flows would increase by $1.7
million.  The Trust believes that the change in the fair value of its financial
instruments resulting from a forseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be
immaterial to its total assets and total liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997



SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Federal Realty Investment Trust (the "Trust") invests in income-producing
retail real estate, primarily community and neighborhood shopping centers and
main street retail properties, retail buildings and shopping centers in densely
developed urban and suburban areas. In addition, the Trust has various land
parcels under its control for the purpose of developing mixed-use projects that
center around the retail component.

    The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the
"Code").  Under those sections, a trust which distributes at least 95% of its
real estate trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets
certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income
which is distributed to its shareholders.  Therefore, no provision for Federal
income taxes is required.

    The consolidated financial statements of the Trust include the accounts of
the Trust, its wholly owned corporate subsidiaries, several corporations where
the Trust has a majority ownership, numerous partnerships and a joint venture,
all of which it controls. The equity interests of other investors are reflected
as investors' interest in consolidated assets. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition. Leases with tenants are classified as operating leases and
are recognized on a straight line basis.  Minimum rents are recognized on an
accrual basis over the terms of the related leases with appropriate valuation
adjustments recorded to consider credit and other business risk.  Percentage
rents, which represent additional rents based on gross tenant sales, are
recognized at the end of the lease year or other period in which tenant sales'
volumes have been reached and the percentage rents are due. Real estate tax and
other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in
which the expenditures occurred.

Real Estate. Land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at
cost.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful
lives range from three to 25 years on apartment buildings and improvements, and
from three to 35 years on retail properties and improvements.  Maintenance and
repair costs are charged to operations as incurred.  Major improvements are
capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.  The gain or loss
resulting from the sale of  properties is included in net income at the time of
sale. The Trust evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard

                                      F-7



("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of". In cases where particular assets are being
held for sale, impairment is based on whether the fair value (estimated sales
price less costs of disposal) of each individual property to be sold is less
than the net book value. Otherwise, impairment is based on whether it is
probable that undiscounted future cash flows from each property will be less
than its net book value. If a property is impaired, its basis is adjusted to its
fair market value. During the second quarter of 1999, the Trust recorded a $7.1
million charge, representing the estimated loss on a potential sale of certain
assets, principally Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia, thereby valuing the
assets at their estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. On October
18, 1999 the Trust sold Northeast Plaza for $19.6 million, realizing a loss of
$6.3 million.

    The Trust, when applicable as lessee, classifies its leases of land and
buildings as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases".

    Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development,
redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and their
related indirect costs are capitalized. The capitalized costs associated with
developments, redevelopments and leasing are depreciated or amortized over the
life of the improvement and lease, respectively.  Through March 1998,  internal
costs of preacquisition activities incurred in connection with the acquisition
of an operating property were capitalized.  On March 19, 1998 the Emerging
Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a
consensus opinion on issue #97-11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to
Real Estate Property Acquisitions" which requires that the internal costs of
preacquisition activities incurred in connection with the acquisition of an
operating property be expensed as incurred.  Consequently, the Trust has been
expensing these costs since March 1998.

    Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as
part of the development and redevelopment.

Debt Issue Costs. Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are
capitalized and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the related
issue using the effective interest method.  Upon conversion or in the event of
redemption, applicable unamortized costs are charged to shareholders' equity or
to operations, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Trust defines cash as cash on hand, demand
deposits with financial institutions and short term liquid investments with an
initial maturity under three months.  Cash balances in individual banks may
exceed insurable amounts from time to time.

Risk Management. In June 1998, SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued.  This statement established
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments

                                      F-8


embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. It requires that an
entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. If
certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a
hedge of the exposure to certain risks. SFAS No. 137, "Deferral of Effective
Date of SFAS No. 133 was issued and delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 133
to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 2000. The Trust
occasionally enters into derivative contracts prior to a scheduled financing or
refinancing in order to minimize the risk of changes in interest rates. The
derivative contracts are designated as hedges when acquired. The cost or gain on
these transactions is recognized as a component of interest expense over the
life of the financing. The Trust does not use derivative financial instruments
for trading or speculative purposes. There were no open derivative contracts at
December 31, 1999 or 1998.

Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  These estimates are
prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current
events.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Comprehensive Income. The Trust has no comprehensive income and therefore does
not require separate reporting in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

Earnings Per Share.  In 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 128 - "Earnings Per Share".  Statement 128 replaces the presentation of
primary and fully diluted earnings per share ("EPS") pursuant to Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 15 with the presentation of basic and diluted EPS.
Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available for
common shareholders by the weighted number of common shares outstanding for the
period.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted
into common shares and then shared in the earnings of the Trust.

                                      F-9



     The following table sets forth the reconciliation between basic and diluted
EPS (in thousands):


  Stock options are accounted for in accordance with APB 25, whereby if options
are priced at fair market value or above at the date of grant, no compensation
expense is recognized.


NOTE 1: REAL ESTATE AND ENCUMBRANCES

     A summary of the Trust's properties at December 31, 1999 and 1998 is as
follows (in thousands):



                                     F-10


     During 1999, the Trust expended cash of $25.3 million to acquire real
estate and an additional $90.8 million to improve, redevelop and develop its
existing real estate. The Trust acquired a ninety percent interest in three
buildings, valued at $26.4 million, in Hollywood, California for a total cash
investment to the Trust of $23.7 million. The first two buildings have 122,000
and 64,000 leasable square feet, respectively. The third building is vacant
pending redevelopment. In addition, the Trust increased by $1.6 million its
partnership interest in Kings Court in Los Gatos, California.

   Of the $90.8 million spent in 1999 on the Trust's existing real estate
portfolio, approximately $38.7 million was invested in predevelopment and
development projects in Bethesda, Maryland; Los Gatos, California; San Jose,
California; San Antonio, Texas; and in Arlington, Virginia. The remaining $52.1
million of capital expenditures relates to improvements to common areas, tenant
work and various redevelopments, including the renovation of Gratiot Plaza, the
expansion and retenanting of Langhorne Square shopping center,  the renovation
of Blue Star shopping center, and the redevelopment of street retail assets in
Forest Hills, New York.

  The Trust's 123 retail properties at December 31, 1999 are located in 15
states and the District of Columbia.  There are approximately 2,200 tenants
providing a wide range of retail products and services.  These tenants range
from sole proprietorships to national retailers;  no one tenant or corporate
group of tenants account for 2% or more of revenue.

  Mortgage notes receivable of $53.5 million are due over various terms from
March 2000 to May 2021 and have an average weighted interest rate of 10%.  Under
the terms of certain of these mortgages, the Trust will receive additional
interest based upon the gross income of the secured properties and, upon sale of
the properties, the Trust will share in the appreciation of the properties.

  During the second quarter of 1999,the Trust recorded a $7.1 million charge,
representing the estimated loss on the potential sale of certain assets,
principally Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia.  On October 18, 1999 the Trust
sold Northeast Plaza for $19.6 million, realizing a loss of $6.3 million.

  On May 13, 1997 the Trust sold Town & Country Shopping Center in Springfield,
Illinois for $7.5 million, resulting in a gain of $5.3 million. On May 30, 1997
Shillington Shopping Center in Shillington, Pennsylvania was sold for $4.6
million, resulting in a gain of $1.7 million. On September 25, 1997 the Trust
sold Brainerd Village Shopping Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee for $10.2
million, resulting in a loss of $659,000.

  Mortgages payable and capital lease obligations are due in installments over
various terms extending to 2016 and 2060, respectively, with interest rates
ranging from 4.8% to 11.25%.  Certain of the mortgage and capital lease
obligations require additional interest payments based upon property
performance.

                                     F-11


There were no maturing mortgages in 1999. In 1998 and 1997 the Trust paid off
maturing mortgages totaling $53.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively.

  Aggregate mortgage principal payments due during the next two years are
$583,000, and $30.7 million, respectively.  There are no further mortgage
principal payments due until 2005 when principal payments begin on the Leesburg
mortgage.

  Future minimum lease payments and their present value for property under
capital leases as of December 31, 1999, are as follows (in thousands):



Leasing Arrangements
- --------------------

     The Trust's leases with retail property and apartment tenants are
classified as operating leases.  Leases on apartments are generally for a period
of one year, whereas retail property leases generally range from three to 10
years (certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer), and usually provide
for contingent rentals based on sales and sharing of certain operating costs.

     The components of rental income are as follows (in thousands):



The components of rental expense are as follows (in thousands):



                                     F-12


     Minimum future retail property rentals on noncancelable operating leases on
operating properties as of December 31, 1999 are as follows (in thousands):



NOTE 2. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- -------------------------------------------

  The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by the Trust,
using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimates of fair value.  The
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that
could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.

  The Trust estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using the
following methods and assumptions: (1) quoted market prices, when available, are
used to estimate the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity
securities; (2) quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of the
Trust's marketable convertible subordinated debentures; (3) discounted cash flow
analyses are used to estimate the fair value of long term  notes receivable and
payable, using the Trust's estimate of current interest rates for similar notes;
(4) carrying amounts in the balance sheet approximate fair value for cash and
short term borrowings.  Notes receivable from officers are excluded from fair
value estimation since they have been issued in connection with employee stock
ownership programs.



                                     F-13


NOTE 3. NOTES PAYABLE
- ---------------------

  The Trust's notes consist of the following (in thousands):



  In December 1997 the Trust obtained a five year syndicated credit facility for
$300 million which currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 65 basis points and
matures December 2002. The syndicated facility requires fees and has various
covenants including the maintenance of a minimum shareholders' equity and a
maximum ratio of debt to net worth.

  In December 1998 the Trust obtained a four year loan of $125 million from five
institutional lenders.  The loan, which bears interest only at LIBOR plus 75
basis points and matures in December 2002, requires fees and has the same
covenants as the syndicated credit facility.  The Trust is in compliance with
all covenants.

  The maximum drawn under these facilities during 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $330.0
million, $259.1 million and $114.8 million, respectively.  In 1999, 1998 and
1997 the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 5.9%, 6.1% and 6.5%,
respectively, and the average amount outstanding was $296.4 million, $163.6
million and $59.9 million, respectively.

NOTE 4. 5 1/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES
- ---------------------------------------------------

  In October 1993 the Trust issued $75.0 million of 5 1/4% convertible
subordinated debentures, realizing cash proceeds of approximately $73.0 million.
The debentures were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and were
not publicly distributed within the United States.  The debentures, which mature
in 2003, are convertible into shares of beneficial interest at $36 per share.
The debentures are redeemable by the Trust, in whole, at any time after October
28, 1998 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest.

  At December 1999 and 1998 the Trust had outstanding $289,000 of 5 1/4%
convertible subordinated debentures due 2002.  The debentures which are
convertible into shares of beneficial interest at $30.625 were not registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 and were not publicly distributed within the
United States.

                                     F-14


NOTE 5. SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES
- -----------------------------------
Unsecured senior notes and debentures at December 31, 1999 and 1998 consist of
the following (in thousands):



The 8.875% Notes were paid in full in January 2000; see Note 14. The loan
agreements contain various covenants, including limitations on the amount of
debt and minimum debt service coverage ratios. The Trust is in compliance with
all covenants.

  In anticipation of the March 1998 Medium-Term Note issuance, on January 13,
1998 the Trust purchased a Treasury Yield Hedge (notional amount of $50 million)
to minimize the risk of changes in interest rates.  The hedge was terminated on
March 5, 1998 at a gain of $1.1 million which is being recognized as a reduction
in interest expense over the term of the notes.  There were no open hedge
agreements at December 31, 1999 or 1998.

  In September 1998 the Trust filed a $500 million shelf registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission which allows the issuance of debt
securities, preferred shares and common shares.  As of December 31, 1999, $325
million is available under the shelf registration.


NOTE 6. DIVIDENDS
- -----------------

  On November 4, 1999 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.45
per common share, payable January 14, 2000 to common shareholders of record
January 3, 2000.  For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, $.16,
$.31, and $.19 of dividends paid per common share, respectively, represented a
return of capital.

  On November 4, 1999 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.49687
per share on its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, payable on
January 31, 2000 to shareholders of record on January 14, 2000.

                                     F-15


NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- -------------------------------------

  The Trust is involved in various lawsuits and environmental matters arising in
the normal course of business. Management believes that such matters will not
have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
the Trust.

  Pursuant to the provisions of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement,
in the event of the exercise of put options by another partner, the Trust would
be required to purchase a 37.5%  interest at Congressional Plaza at its then
fair market value.  Based on management's current estimate of fair market value,
the Trust's estimated liability upon exercise of the put option is approximately
$27 million.

  On January 1, 1999 the Loehmann's Plaza Limited Partnership Agreement was
amended to extend the partnership to December 31, 2000 and to delete the put and
call options.  On January 1, 2000 the partnership agreement was again amended
and restated.  Under this amended and restated agreement, the limited partner
was awarded 190,000 partnership units in exchange for a 98% partnership
interest.

  Under the terms of certain other partnerships, if certain leasing and revenue
levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships,  the limited
partners may require the Trust to purchase their partnership interests at a
formula price based upon net operating income.  The purchase price may be paid
in cash or common shares of the Trust, at the election of the limited partners.
If the limited partners do not redeem their interest, the Trust may choose to
purchase the limited partnership interests upon the same terms.

  Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Loehmann's Plaza Limited
Partnership Agreement and certain other partnerships, the partners may exchange
their operating partnership units, totaling 1,004,589, into cash or the same
number of common shares of the Trust, at the option of the Trust. During the
third quarter of 1999 the Trust redeemed 64,952 operating units for cash of $1.6
million.

  As of December 31, 1999 in connection with renovation and development
projects, the Trust has contractual obligations of $59 million.

  The Trust is obligated under ground lease agreements on several shopping
centers requiring minimum annual payments as follows (in thousands):



                                     F-16


NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
- ----------------------------

  In May 1999, the Trust reorganized as a Maryland real estate investment trust
by amending and restating its declaration of trust and bylaws.  The Amended
Declaration of Trust changed the number of authorized shares of common and
preferred shares from unlimited to 100,000,000 and 15,000,000, respectively.  In
addition, all common shares of beneficial interest, no par value, which were
issued and outstanding were changed to common shares of beneficial interest,
$0.01 par value per share and all Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Shares of beneficial interest, no par value, which were issued and outstanding
were changed to Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of beneficial
interest, $0.01 par value per share.

  On February 4, 1997 the Trust sold three million common shares to an
institutional investor for $28 per share, netting $83.9 million.

  On October 6, 1997 the Trust issued four million 7.95% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares at $25 per share in a public offering, realizing
cash proceeds of approximately $96.6 million after costs of $3.4 million.  The
Series A Preferred Shares are not redeemable prior to October 6, 2002.  On or
after that date, the Preferred Shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at
the option of the Trust, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus all accrued
and unpaid dividends.  The redemption price is payable solely out of proceeds
from the sale of other capital shares of the Trust.  Dividends on the Preferred
Shares will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of January, April,
July and October.

  The Trust has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, whereby shareholders may use their
dividends and make optional cash payments to purchase shares.  In 1999, 1998,
and 1997, 165,770 shares, 167,511 shares, and 153,973 shares, respectively, were
issued under the Plan.

  In December 1999 the Trustees authorized a share repurchase program of up to
an aggregate of 4 million of the Trust's common shares. The repurchase program
will end upon the earlier of December 31, 2000 or the date when the repurchase
limit has been met. As of December 31, 1999, 140,500 shares had been repurchased
at a cost of $2.6 million.

  In 1999, 65,660 common shares were awarded, and 5,006 shares were forfeited
and retired, to the Trust's president and other key employees under various
incentive compensation programs.  Fifteen thousand shares vested upon award, and
the balance vest over terms from 5 to 13 years.

  In 1998, 576,055 common shares, of which 35,000 were issued from treasury
shares, were awarded to the Trust's president and certain other officers under
various programs designed to directly link a significant portion of their long
term compensation to the

                                     F-17


prosperity of the Trust and its shareholders. Ten thousand shares vested upon
award, 491,055 shares vest over terms from 5 to 13 years, and 75,000 shares vest
upon the obtainment of certain performance criteria.

  On January 31, 1997, 22,000 restricted shares were granted to an officer and
two employees of the Trust.  The shares vest over three years.  On September 26,
1997, 10,000  restricted common shares were granted to an officer;  the shares,
which were fully vested upon grant, were issued from treasury shares.

  In January 1994 under the terms of the 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan, an
officer of the Trust purchased 40,000 common shares at $25 per share with the
assistance of a $1.0 million loan from the Trust. The loan, which has a term of
12 years and a current balance of $625,500, bears interest at 6.24%. Forgiveness
of up to 75% of the loan is subject to the future performance of the Trust. One
eighth of the loan was forgiven on January 31, 1995 and an additional one
sixteenth has been forgiven each January 31 since then as certain performance
criteria of the Trust were met.

  In January 1991 the Trustees adopted the Federal Realty Investment Trust Share
Purchase Plan.  Under the terms of this plan, officers and certain employees of
the Trust purchased 446,000 common shares at $15.125 per share with the
assistance of loans of $6.7 million from the Trust.  Originally, the Plan called
for one sixteenth of the loan to be forgiven each year for eight years, as long
as the participant was still employed by the Trust. The loans for all
participants, but two, were modified in 1994 to extend the term an additional
four years and to tie forgiveness in 1995 and thereafter to certain performance
criteria of the Trust. One sixteenth of the loan has been forgiven during each
year of the plan.  At December 31, 1999 the Trust has outstanding purchase loans
to participants of $1.8 million.  The purchase loans bear interest at 9.39%.
The shares purchased under the plan may not be sold, pledged or assigned until
both the purchase and tax loans associated with the plan are satisfied and the
term has expired, without the consent of the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Trustees.

  Tax loans with a balance of $1.3 million in 1999 and $1.1 million in 1998 have
been made in connection with restricted share grants to the Trust's President
and Chief Investment Officer and in connection with the Share Purchase Plans.

  On April 13, 1999, the Shareholder Rights Plan adopted in 1989 expired. On
March 11, 1999 the Trust entered into an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement
with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, pursuant to which (i)the
expiration date of the Trust's shareholder rights plan was extended for an
additional ten years to April 24, 2009, (ii)the beneficial ownership percentage
at which a person becomes an "Acquiring Person" under the plan was reduced from
20% to 15%, and (iii)certain other amendments were made.

                                     F-18


NOTE 9. STOCK OPTION PLAN
- -------------------------

  The 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan ("Plan") has been amended to authorize the
grant of options and other stock based awards for up to 5.5 million shares.
Options granted under the Plan have ten year terms and vest in one to five
years. Under the Plan, on each annual meeting date during the term of the Plan,
each nonemployee Trustee will be awarded 2,500 options.

  The option price to acquire shares under the 1993 Plan and previous plans is
required to be at least the fair market value at the date of grant.  As a result
of the exercise of options, the Trust had outstanding from its officers and
employees notes for $3.6 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  The notes issued under the 1993 Plan bear interest at the
dividend rate on the date of exercise divided by the purchase price of such
shares.  The notes issued under the previous plans bear interest at the lesser
of (i) the Trust's borrowing rate or (ii) the current indicated annual dividend
rate on the shares acquired pursuant to the option, divided by the purchase
price of such shares.  The notes are collateralized by the shares and are with
recourse. The loans have a term extending to the employee's or officer's
retirement date.

  SFAS Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" requires pro
forma information regarding net income and earnings per share as if the Trust
accounted for its stock options under the fair value method of that Statement.
The fair value for options issued in 1999, 1998, and 1997 has been estimated as
$434,000, $2.6 million, and $4.0 million, respectively, as of the date of grant,
using a binomial model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 5.4%, 5.7%,and 6.5%;
volatility factors of the expected market price of the Trust's shares of 15%,
19%, and 19%; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 6.6 years,
6.3 years, and 6.6 years.

  Because option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, such as the expected stock price volatility, and because changes in
these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, the existing model may not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its stock options.

  For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
are amortized to expense over the options' vesting period.  The pro forma
information is as follows (in thousands except for earnings per share):




                                     F-19


  A summary of the Trust's stock option activity for the years ended December
31, is as follows:



  At December 31, 1999 and 1998, options for 1.9 million and 1.5 million shares,
respectively, were exercisable.  The average remaining contractual life of
options outstanding at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was 6.7 years and 7.1 years,
respectively.  The weighted average grant date fair value per option for options
granted in 1999 and 1998 was $.65 and $2.00, respectively.  The exercise price
of options outstanding at December 31, 1999 ranged from $17.25 per share to
$27.13 per share.

NOTE 10. SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLANS
- -------------------------------------

  The Trust has a savings and retirement plan in accordance with the provisions
of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Employees' contributions range,
at the discretion of each employee, from 1% to 17% of compensation up to a
maximum of $10,000.  Under the plan, the Trust, out of its current net income,
contributes 50% of each employee's first 5% of contributions.  In addition, the
Trust may make discretionary contributions within the limits of deductibility
set forth by the Code.  Employees of the Trust, who work over 1,000 hours
annually, are eligible to become plan participants.  The Trust's expense for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $223,000, $218,000 and
$210,000, respectively.

  A nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Trust officers was established
in 1994.  The plan allows the officers to defer future income until the earlier
of age 65 or termination of employment with the Trust.  As of December 31, 1999,
the Trust is liable to participants for approximately $2.4 million under this
plan.  Although this is an unfunded plan, the Trust has purchased certain
investments with which to match this obligation.

                                     F-20


NOTE 11. INTEREST EXPENSE
- -------------------------

  The Trust incurred interest expense totaling $68.4 million, $60.2 million and
$50.9 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, of which $6.9 million, $5.1
million, and $3.6 million respectively, was capitalized.  Interest paid was
$67.0 million in 1999, $57.8 million in 1998, and $49.4 million in 1997.


NOTE 12. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
- --------------------------------

     During 1999 while exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder
value, the Trust considered spinning off certain of its assets (primarily those
related to the development and operation of its main street retail program) in a
taxable transaction to shareholders.  Shortly thereafter, the remaining assets
of the Trust were to be merged with another publicly traded shopping center
company in exchange for cash and stock consideration.  On September 24, 1999,
the Trust announced that merger negotiations were terminated and that the spin-
off was being reevaluated.

     In preparing for these transactions, the Trust incurred expenses of
approximately $2.8 million related to legal, accounting, tax and other advisory
services related to the spin-off and the merger.  Such costs have been expensed
and are reflected as administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations.  While management continues to evaluate alternatives to
maximize shareholder value, there are currently no plans to consummate a spin-
off or merger transaction.

  At September 30, 1998 the Trust recorded a $4.7 million  charge related to a
comprehensive restructuring program, the implementation of which was begun
during the fourth quarter of 1998. As of December 31, 1999 cash payments of $3.9
million had been made against the reserve with most of the remaining cash to be
paid during 2000 in connection with severance agreements.

NOTE 13. Year 2000 Readiness
- ----------------------------

  During 1999 the Trust continued to focus on ways to minimize the risk of
disruption from the "Year 2000 Issue" which generally refers to the inability of
systems hardware and software to correctly identify two-digit references to
specific calendar years, beginning with 2000. The Year 2000 Issue could affect
the Trust directly by impairing its internal data-based operations or processing
and indirectly by impairing its suppliers' and tenants' data-based operations or
processing. The Trust identified and remediated all accounting systems and other
internal systems of high priority. In addition the Trust requested information
concerning and reviewed the equipment at its properties, including the use of
embedded chips in machinery. The Trust also communicated with its major banks,
tenants and suppliers to determine their Year 2000 compliance. Expenditures for
Year 2000 remediation were approximately $75,000. To date the operations and
financial condition of the Trust had not been adversely impacted by any Year
2000 failures

                                     F-21


and the Trust does not believe that there is any material risk to the Trust in
these areas in the future.


NOTE 14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
- --------------------------

  Under a Restricted Share Agreement designed to link his compensation with the
prosperity of the shareholders, the Trust's President elected to accept stock in
lieu of cash for both his 1999 bonus and his 2000 salary.  As a result, in 2000,
35,349 common shares were awarded to the president in lieu of his 2000 cash
salary and 22,222 shares were awarded in lieu of his 1999 cash bonus.  The
shares vest at the end of five years if the president is still employed by the
Trust.

     Pursuant to the 1999 Incentive Bonus Plan, vice presidents and certain key
employees receive part of their 1999 bonus in Federal Realty shares which vest
over three years.  Consequently, on February 9, 2000, 24,038 shares were awarded
under this plan.  In addition, 144,700 shares were awarded to certain vice
presidents of the Trust in accordance with programs to link their current and
long-term compensation to the prosperity of the Trust. The shares have vesting
schedules from five to eight years.

     On January 5, 2000 the Trust purchased the 75,000 square foot Greenlawn
Shopping Center in Greenlawn, New York for $6.0 million, with plans to renovate
and expand the center by 35,000 square feet.

     On January 17, 2000 the Trust's $100 million of 8.875% Notes matured and
were paid with borrowings on the Trust's revolving credit facilities. In January
2000 the Trust obtained a construction loan commitment for up to $24.5 million
in connection with the Trust's Woodmont East development in Bethesda, Maryland.
The loan, which has a floating interest rate of the greater of prime or the
Federal Funds Rate plus .5% or a fixed rate option of  LIBOR plus 1.5%, has an
initial term of 24 months with two one year extension options.

     From January 1, 2000 through March 14, 2000, the Trust repurchased 908,100
common shares at a cost of $17.4 million, in connection with its share
repurchase program.


NOTE 15. SEGMENT INFORMATION
- ----------------------------

  The Trust traditionally operated its business as a single business segment.
During the fourth quarter of 1998, however, the Trust completed a comprehensive
restructuring program which, among other things, divided its portfolio of assets
into three geographic operating regions: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West.
During 1999 there was a minor reorganization of the regions which moved the
Illinois and Michigan properties to the Northeast region from the Western
region.
