                                    PART I & II

   Item 1. Business

     Federal Realty Investment Trust  is an owner, operator and  redeveloper of
   community  and  neighborhood  shopping  centers.    The  Trust  is  a  self-
   administered real estate investment  trust, founded in 1962.   Since January
   1989, the Trust has  been managing, leasing, and supervising  renovations of
   most of its properties.

     The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to  qualify as a real
   estate  investment  trust (REIT)  under  Sections  856-860 of  the  Internal
   Revenue  Code.  Under those sections, a  REIT which distributes at least 95%
   of its real estate  investment trust taxable income to its shareholders each
   year and  which meets certain  other conditions  will not be  taxed on  that
   portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  The
   Trust intends to continue to qualify and to distribute substantially  all of
   its taxable income to its shareholders.  Therefore, no provision for Federal
   income taxes is required.

     The Trust's real estate  portfolio has increased from 42 properties  as of
   January 1989 to  49 properties as of  December 31, 1993.   During this  five
   year period the Trust acquired 11 shopping centers, containing approximately
   2.5 million  square feet, at a cost of $196.0 million and sold four shopping
   centers  containing 692,000 square feet.  During  this same period the Trust
   spent over $130 million to renovate, expand and improve its properties.  Two
   of the 11 shopping centers acquired during the last five years were acquired
   under capital  leases with an original recorded  value of $34.0 million; one
   was acquired  subject to  a $2.5  million  mortgage and  the remainder  were
   acquired with cash.   This growth was financed primarily  through borrowings
   and  equity offerings, since each year the  Trust has distributed all or the
   majority of its cash provided by operating activities to its shareholders.

     At December  31, 1993 the  Trust owned or  had a leasehold  interest in 47
   community   and  neighborhood  shopping   centers  and  one  air-conditioned
   partially enclosed mall.  These 48 shopping centers contain in the aggregate
   approximately 10.6 million net  rentable square feet.  The  Trust's shopping


   centers  usually  feature supermarket,  drug  or  discount department  store
   chains.   There  are approximately 1,500  tenants providing a  wide range of
   retail products and services.  These tenants range from sole proprietorships
   to national retailers.  Fourteen of the shopping centers are  located in the
   Maryland  and   Virginia  suburbs  of   Washington,  D.C.,  eleven   are  in
   Pennsylvania, nine are  in New Jersey, three are in Virginia, two are in the
   Baltimore,  Maryland suburbs, two are  in Illinois and  the remainder are in
   North  Carolina,  Michigan,  Georgia,  New York,  Tennessee,  Louisiana  and
   Massachusetts.  The  Trust also  owns one apartment  development located  in
   Silver Spring, Maryland, containing 282 units.  No single property or tenant
   accounts for more than 10% of the Trust's revenues.

     An important  part of the Trust's  investment strategy has been  and is to
   acquire  older,  well-located shopping  centers  and  enhance their  revenue
   potential through a program  of renovation, re-leasing and re-merchandising.
   In  addition the Trust is currently seeking  to acquire sites to develop new
   shopping  centers.   The Trust's policy  is to  execute tenant  leases which
   provide for additional rent based upon tenant sales revenue and  annual rent
   escalations.   Tenants are  typically  required to  pay their  proportionate
   share of on-site operating expenses and real estate taxes.  During the years
   ended December 31, 1993,  1992, and 1991, shopping centers  have contributed
   94%, 92% and 93%, respectively, of the Trust's total revenue.

     The Trust intends to continue to invest substantially all of its assets in
   shopping  centers.  The Trust is currently  limited to investing east of the
   Mississippi  River; to  change  this limitation  requires Trustee  approval.
   Investments are not required to  be based on specific allocation by  type of
   property.   The extent to which the  Trust may mortgage or otherwise finance
   investments varies with the investment involved and the economic climate.  

     The success of the Trust depends upon, among other factors,  the trends of
   the  economy,  construction  costs,   retailing  trends,  income  tax  laws,
   increases  or  decreases in  operating  expenses,  governmental regulations,
   population trends, zoning laws, legislation and the ability of the Trust  to
   keep  its properties  leased at profitable  levels.  The  Trust competes for
   tenants with other real estate owners and the Trust's properties account for
   only  a small  fraction of the  shopping centers  available for  lease.  The


   Trust  competes for  investment  opportunities and  mortgage financing  with
   individuals,  partnerships,  corporations,   financial  institutions,   life
   insurance companies,  pension funds and trust funds.  The Trust engages in a
   continuing  program  to identify  desirable  properties on  which  offers to
   acquire are made from time to  time.  Similarly, the Trust regularly reviews
   its  portfolio and from time  to time considers  the sale of  certain of its
   properties.

     Investments  in  real  property   create  a  potential  for  environmental
   liability on the part of the current and previous owners of, or any mortgage
   lender on, such real property.  If hazardous substances are discovered on or
   emanating from  any properties, the owner or operator of the property may be
   held liable for costs and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances.
   The  Trust's current  policy is  to obtain  an environmental  study  on each
   property  it seeks  to  acquire.   On  recent acquisitions,  any  substances
   identified prior to  closing which present an immediate environmental hazard
   have  been or  are in  the process  of remediation.   Costs  related to  the
   abatement  of  asbestos which  increase the  value  of Trust  properties are
   capitalized.  Other costs are expensed.  In 1993 approximately $1.5 million,
   of  which $1.0 was capitalized  abatement costs, was  spent on environmental
   matters.  The Trust has budgeted a range of $1.5 million to $2.7 million for
   1994  for  environmental  matters, a  majority  of  which  is projected  for
   asbestos  abatement.   (See  Note  4  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
   Statements.)

   Current Developments

     The Trust  believes that  now  is an  opportune time  to acquire  shopping
   centers.   The credit environment for real estate companies has improved and
   with the recent recession ended, the  Trust expects an increased demand  for
   retail  space.   During  1992  and  1993 in  order  to  improve its  capital
   structure and to finance the expansion its  real estate portfolio, the Trust
   raised equity  and debt.  The Trust took advantage of the favorable interest
   rate environment in 1993 by replacing higher rate debt with  lower rate debt
   and replaced near term maturing debt with longer term  debt.  As a result of
   these transactions,  the Trust's debt to equity ratio has dropped to 1.28 to
   1 as of December 31, 1993.


     In  April 1993 the  Trust sold 2.8  million shares of  beneficial interest
   ("shares") in a public offering, raising  net proceeds of $72.8 million.  In
   December  1993 another  220,000 shares  were issued  for $5.4  million  in a
   private placement in connection with the long term lease of a property.

     The  Trust called its 8  3/4% convertible subordinated  debentures and its
   8.65%  Senior Notes  for redemption  in 1993.   The Trust  redeemed $173,000
   principal  amount of  the  8 3/4%  debentures  at a  price  of $1017.50  per
   debenture  on  March 15;    the  balance of  the  debentures  that had  been
   outstanding, or $2.2  million, were converted to  shares.  The Senior  Notes
   were redeemed on  May 14,  1993 at a  price of  $1010 per Note  for a  total
   redemption price of $50.5 million.

     During 1993 the  Trust purchased  $3.7 million of  its 5 1/4%  convertible
   subordinated debentures  due 2002, so  that at  December 31, 1993  there was
   $40.2 million of the original $100.0 million outstanding.

     In  October 1993 the Trust took advantage of favorable financing rates and
   issued  in   Europe  $75.0  million  of  5   1/4%  convertible  subordinated
   debentures,  raising cash  proceeds  of approximately  $73.0  million.   The
   debentures, which mature  in 2003, are  convertible into  shares at $36  per
   share.

     During  1993 the Trust prepaid $34.9 million of mortgage obligations whose
   interest rates were higher than current rates.

     The Trust acquired seven shopping centers in 1993.  Pan Am Shopping Center
   in  Fairfax, Virginia was acquired  for $21.6 million  in cash; Gaithersburg
   Square in Gaithersburg, Maryland was purchased for $11.0 million in cash and
   the assumption  of a $2.0 million  liability which is the  estimated cost to
   remediate certain preexisting environmental issues;  Quince Orchard Plaza in
   Gaithersburg, Maryland and its adjoining office building were  purchased for
   $10.9 million  in cash and  the assumption of  a liability  of approximately
   $250,000;  Crossroads  Shopping  Center   in  Highland  Park,  Illinois  was
   purchased  for $16.2  million  in  cash;   Bala  Cynwyd Shopping  Center  in
   suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was purchased for $17.0 million in cash;
   Dedham Plaza in  Dedham, Massachusetts  was purchased for  $25.0 million  in


   cash  and the  assumption  of a  $250,000  liability to  remediate  existing
   environmental  issues;  and  the  leasehold  interest  in  Bethesda  Row  in
   Bethesda, Maryland was acquired with $6.2 million in cash.

     The   Trust  continued   its   strategy  of   renovating,  expanding   and
   reconfiguring  its centers  in 1993,  spending approximately  $34.3 million.
   These  improvements  included  $6.5  million  to  purchase  and  renovate  a
   department store building at The Shops at Willow Lawn, $4.6 million to begin
   renovation and retenanting of  Ellisburg Circle, $1.5 million for  the first
   phase of the redevelopment  at Huntington Shopping Center, and  $2.3 million
   to begin the renovation and retenanting of Troy Shopping Center.

     At December 31, 1993 the Trust had 178 full-time employees.

   Item 7. Management's Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition        
   and Results of Operations

    Liquidity and Capital Resources

        Federal  Realty  meets  its  liquidity requirements  through  net  cash
   provided by operating activities, long-term borrowing through debt offerings
   and  mortgages, medium and short-term  borrowing under lines  of credit, and
   equity offerings.  Because all  or a significant portion of the  Trust's net
   cash  provided  by  operating  activities is  distributed  to  shareholders,
   capital  outlays for  property  acquisitions, renovation  projects and  debt
   repayments require funding from borrowing or equity offerings.

        In order to improve its capital structure and to finance and expand its
   real estate  portfolio, the  Trust raised  equity and  debt during  1992 and
   1993.  The Trust took  advantage of the favorable interest rate  environment
   by replacing  higher rate debt with  lower rate debt and  replaced near term
   maturing debt with longer term debt.  Equity has increased to $284.2 million
   at December 1993, while total debt was $364.2 million at  December 31, 1993.
   The Trust's debt to equity  ratio has consequently dropped from 2.5  to 1 at
   December 31, 1991 to 1.28 to 1 at December 31, 1993.

        In  June 1992 the  Trust sold 3.4  million common shares  of beneficial
   interest  ("shares") in  a public  offering, raising  net proceeds  of $66.5
   million.  In April  1993 another 2.8 million shares were  issued in a public
   offering,  netting  proceeds of  $72.8 million.    In December  1993 another
   220,000 shares  were  issued for  $5.4  million in  a private  placement  in
   connection with the long-term lease of a property.

        In March 1992 the Trust exchanged $22.6 million principal amount of its
   5  1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 for 1.3 million shares.
   Another $21.2 million principal  amount of these debentures were  retired in
   1992 when they were repurchased  by the Trust with proceeds from  the public
   offerings.   The  Trust  purchased  an  additional  $3.7  million  of  these
   debentures in 1993, so that  at December 31, 1993 there was $40.2 million of
   the original $100.0 million outstanding.



        The Trust called its 8 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures and its
   8.65%  Senior  Notes for  redemption in  1993.  The Trust  redeemed $173,000
   principal amount  of  the 8  3/4%  debentures at  a  price of  $1017.50  per
   debenture  on  March  15;  the  balance of  the  debentures  that  had  been
   outstanding  or $2.2 million  were converted into shares.   The Senior Notes
   were redeemed on May 14, at a price of $1010 per note for a total redemption
   price of $50.5 million.

        In October 1993 the  Trust took advantage of favorable  financing rates
   and  issued in  Europe  $75.0 million  of  5 1/4%  convertible  subordinated
   debentures,  realizing cash  proceeds of  approximately $73.0 million.   The
   debentures,  which mature in  2003, are convertible  into shares at  $36 per
   share.  The  debentures are redeemable by the  Trust, in whole, at  any time
   after October  28,  1998  at  100%  of the  principal  amount  plus  accrued
   interest.

         The Trust placed  a $30.0 million  mortgage on Federal Plaza  in 1992;
   the  mortgage  bears interest  beginning at  8  1/4%, resetting  every three
   years,  and matures in 2001.  During 1992 the Trust prepaid  $6.3 million of
   mortgage obligations and   then in  1993 the Trust   prepaid  another  $34.9
   million  of mortgage obligations; the interest rates on these mortgages were
   higher than current rates.  

        At December 31, 1993 the  Trust had $70.0 million of  unsecured medium-
   term revolving credit  facilities with  three banks.   All three  facilities
   require fees and have covenants requiring a minimum shareholders' equity and
   a  maximum ratio of debt  to net worth.  The  Trust uses these facilities to
   fund acquisitions and other cash requirements until conditions are favorable
   for  issuing equity  or long  term debt.     The  maximum drawn  under these
   facilities during 1993 was $64.1 million; at December 31, 1993 the Trust had
   $24.4  million  outstanding under  these  facilities.  The average  weighted
   interest rate on borrowings during 1993 on  these facilities was 4.2%. These
   medium  term facilities  replace a  $20.0 million  unsecured line  of credit
   which was available at December 1992.  The increase in the Trust's revolving
   credit  facilities are  indicative of  the improvement    since 1991  in the
   credit  environment.  The  Trust obtained an  additional unsecured revolving



   credit  facility of  $15.0  million in  February  1994, bringing  its  total
   availability to $85.0 million.

        In February  1994 the Trust borrowed  $22.5 million, which was  used to
   pay down the December 1993 balances on the  revolving credit facilities. The
   loan,  which  is  secured by  the  Northeast  Plaza  Shopping Center,  bears
   interest  at 150 basis points over LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate,
   and is due on January 31, 1995.

        In June 1993  Standard and  Poor's raised  the ratings  on the  Trust's
   subordinated  convertible  debentures  from  BBB-  to  BBB,  reflecting  the
   successful results of the Trust's restructuring of its debt and   increasing
   of its  equity.  In September  1993 Moody's Investors  Service also upgraded
   the Trust's subordinated debt, from Ba1 to Baa2.

        The  Trust's long term debt has varying  maturity dates and in a number
   of instances includes balloon payments  or other contractual provisions that
   could  require  significant  repayments  during a  particular  period.   The
   earliest balloon repayment is in April 1994, when the holders of the Trust's
   5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 may require the Trust to
   redeem the notes for $48.2 million (120% of the principal amount).  The next
   balloon repayment is in  1998 when approximately $41.3 million  of mortgages
   are due.
    
        Major expenditures of  capital by  the Trust during  1993 included  the
   following:  (1) $101.8  million to  acquire six  shopping centers;  (2) $6.2
   million incurred  in  connection with  the  long  term lease  of  a  seventh
   shopping center; (3) $32.5 million to prepay mortgages; (4) $50.5 million to
   redeem  the  Senior  Notes; (5)  $4.6  million  to  redeem portions  of  the
   convertible  subordinated debt;  and (6)  $34.3 million  in improvements  to
   properties.    These  improvements included  $6.5  million  to purchase  and
   renovate  a  department store  building at  The Shops  at Willow  Lawn, $4.6
   million to  begin renovation  and retenanting of  Ellisburg Circle  Shopping
   Center, $1.5 million for the first phase of the redevelopment at  Huntington
   Shopping Center, $2.3  million to  begin the renovation  and retenanting  at
   Troy Shopping Center and $9.5 million in tenant work.  Cash requirements for



   these expenditures were  met by the  net proceeds of  the recent equity  and
   debt offerings and from borrowings on the  revolving credit facilities. 

        Major expenditures of  capital by  the Trust during  1992 included  the
   following:  (1) $15.3 million to purchase  Ellisburg Circle Shopping Center;
   (2)  $9.1 million to purchase  the land underlying  Wildwood Shopping Center
   which had been  subject to  a long term  ground lease; (3)  $8.5 million  to
   repay  short term  borrowings;  (4)  $23.6  million  to  repurchase  5  1/4%
   convertible  subordinated debentures due  2002; (5)  $8.0 million  to prepay
   mortgages;  and  (6) $15.2  million in  improvements to   properties.   Cash
   requirements for  these expenditures were  met by the net  proceeds from the
   sale of Sargent Road and 25th Street Shopping Centers, the net proceeds from
   the mortgage on Federal Plaza and the proceeds of public offerings.

        The  Trust has budgeted $49.0  million for capital  improvements to its
   properties in 1994.  These improvements include: (1)  $14.0 million to begin
   the renovation and redevelopment of Congressional Plaza; (2) $4.0 million to
   begin renovation  at Brick Plaza;  (3) $6.0 million  to begin renovation  of
   Gaithersburg Square; and (4) approximately $9.0 million for tenant work.  In
   addition  the  Trust  has  budgeted  $48.2 million  to  redeem  the  5  1/4%
   convertible  subordinated debentures  due  2002, which  the noteholders  may
   require the  Trust to redeem in April 1994,  and $4.1 million to exercise an
   option to purchase  the land at Northeast Shopping  Center in December 1994.
   These  expenditures will  be paid  from proceeds  from borrowings  under its
   medium-term revolving credit facilities  and from the issuance of  long term
   debt or equity.   In preparation for the  future issuance of such  long term
   debt  or equity, the  Trust filed  a shelf  registration statement  with the
   Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective in December 1993,
   under which  up to  $300 million  of  debt securities,  preferred shares  or
   common shares may be issued.

        The State of  New Jersey Division  of Taxation  has assessed the  Trust
   $364,000 in  taxes, penalty and  interest for the  years 1985  through 1990,
   since the State has disallowed the dividends paid deduction in computing New
   Jersey taxable income.  The Trust has filed a  complaint in the Tax Court of
   New Jersey contesting  the assessment  since the Trust  believes that it  is



   entitled  to the deduction.   At this  time, the  outcome of this  matter is
   unknown.

        The North Carolina  Department of the  Environment, Health and  Natural
   Resources issued a Notice of Violation ("NOV") against  a dry cleaner tenant
   at  Eastgate Shopping  Center in  Chapel Hill,  North Carolina  concerning a
   spill at the shopping  center.  As owner  of the shopping center,  the Trust
   was  named in and received  a copy of  the NOV.  Estimates  to remediate the
   spill range from $300,000 to $500,000.  An agreement is being drawn with two
   previous owners of  the shopping center   to share  the costs to  remediate.
   The Trust has recorded a liability of $120,000 as its estimated share of the
   cleanup costs.

        Contaminants at levels in  excess of New Jersey cleanup  standards were
   identified at a shopping center  in New Jersey.   The Trust has retained  an
   environmental consultant  to investigate  the contamination.   The Trust  is
   also evaluating whether it has insurance  coverage for this matter.  At this
   time, the Trust is unable  to determine what the range of  remediation costs
   might be.  The  Trust has also identified chlorinated  solvent contamination
   at two  other properties.   In  each case, the  contamination appears  to be
   linked to the current  and/or previous dry  cleaner.   The Trust intends  to
   look  to the responsible parties for  any remediation effort.  Evaluation of
   these situations is  preliminary and it is impossible  to estimate the range
   of remediation costs, if any.

        The Trust  reserved at closing  $2.25 million for  environmental issues
   principally  associated with  the  recently  acquired  Gaithersburg  Square.
   Pursuant to an indemnity agreement entered into with the seller  at closing,
   the  Trust agreed  to  take  certain  actions  with  respect  to  identified
   chlorinated solvent  contamination.   The seller  indemnified the  Trust for
   certain  third   party  claims   and  government  requirements   related  to
   contamination at adjacent properties.

        Management believes that  the combination of cash available at December
   31, 1993, the revolving credit facilities, and the unencumbered value of the
   Trust's  properties provide the  Trust with  adequate capital  resources and
   liquidity for  operating purposes in the  near future.  The  Trust, however,


   continues  to  renovate  its existing  centers  and  seeks  to acquire  more
   shopping centers.   The Trust will need to raise  equity or issue additional
   debt  in order to fund  its planned renovations in 1994  and to purchase any
   additional shopping centers.  The Trust believes that it has  the ability to
   raise this needed capital through the offering of equity and debt securities
   so that it may  pursue its growth plans as  well as to meet its  longer term
   capital  and debt  financing needs,  including scheduled  loan  payments and
   contractual repayment obligations.  


        Results of Operations

        Funds  from  operations is  defined as  income before  depreciation and
   amortization  and extraordinary  items less  gains on  sale of  real estate.
   Management   believes  that   funds  from   operations  is   an  appropriate
   supplemental  measure  of  the  Trust's  operating  performance  because  it
   believes that reductions  for depreciation and amortization  charges are not
   meaningful  in   evaluating  income-producing   real   estate,  which   have
   historically been appreciating  assets.  The  Trust acquires, evaluates  and
   sells income-producing properties based upon operating income without taking
   into  account property  depreciation and  amortization charges  and utilizes
   funds from operations,  together with other  factors in setting  shareholder
   distribution levels.   Gains on sale of real  estate and extraordinary items
   are also excluded from this supplemental measure of performance because such
   amounts are not  part of  the ongoing operations  of the Trust's  portfolio.
   Funds  from  operations  does  not  replace  net  income  as  a  measure  of
   performance  or net cash  provided by operating  activities as  a measure of
   liquidity.

        Funds from operations increased 38% in 1993 to $41.5 million from $30.0
   million  in 1992.   Funds  from operations  increased 14%  in 1992  to $30.0
   million from $26.2 million in 1991.

        The Trust's shopping center leases generally provide for minimum rents,
   with periodic increases.  Most shopping center tenants pay a majority of on-
   site operating expenses.   Many leases also contain a percentage rent clause
   which calls for additional rents  based on tenant sales, so that at  a given


   sales  volume if prices increase, so does  rental income.  These features in
   the  Trust leases  reduce the  Trust's exposure  to  higher costs  caused by
   inflation, although inflation has not been significant in recent years.  

        Rental income,  which consists of  minimum rent,  percentage rent,  and
   cost recoveries,  increased from $90.0 million in  1992 to $105.9 million in
   1993.  If centers  acquired and sold in  1992 and 1993 are  excluded, rental
   income increased 8.8%  from $88.5 million in 1992 to  $96.3 million in 1993.
   Perring  Plaza, whose  redevelopment  was  completed  late  in  1992,    and
   Huntington   Shopping  Center,   whose  first   phase  of   retenanting  and
   redevelopment  was completed  in  1993, contributed  39%  of this  increase.
   Rental income increased from $88.4 million in 1991 to $90.0 million in 1992;
   if centers  acquired and sold in  1992 and 1991 are  excluded, rental income
   increased 3.5% from $85.5 million to $88.8 million.

        Minimum rents increased from $66.9 million in 1991  to $68.8 million in
   1992 to $81.3  million in 1993.   If centers acquired and  sold during these
   years  are excluded, minimum rents  increased from $64.7  million in 1991 to
   $67.8 million in  1992 to $73.6 million in 1993.  Forty-eight percent of the
   increase from 1992  to 1993 was contributed by Perring  Plaza and Huntington
   Shopping Center. Of the  1992 increase, $400,000 was contributed  by Perring
   Plaza and  $1.2 million was  contributed by  Federal Plaza  which was  under
   redevelopment until May 1991.

        Cost reimbursements,  which generally  increase  as expenses  increase,
   rose from $14.7 million in 1991 to $14.9 million in 1992 to $18.2 million in
   1993.   Excluding centers  acquired and sold  during the  three year period,
   cost reimbursements increased from $14.3 million in 1991 to $14.6 million in
   1992 to $16.4 million in 1993.  The increase in 1993 recoveries relates to a
   corresponding  increase in  expense in  1993 as  discussed below,  while the
   small  increase  in  1992 from  1991  relates  to  the corresponding  slight
   increase in expense in 1992 as compared to 1991.

        Percentage  rents are a fluctuating  source of revenue  based on tenant
   sales volume and  lease rollovers.  When leases are  renewed the Trust seeks
   to set minimum rent at levels that include the past year's percentage rents.
   Percentage rents have decreased from $4.6 million in 1991 to $4.2 million in


   1992 to  $4.1 million in 1993.   Excluding centers sold  and acquired during
   the three  year period, percentage rents have decreased from $4.3 million in
   1991 to $4.0 million in 1992 to  $3.9 million in 1993.  The decreases result
   primarily  from rolling percentage rent  into minimum rents  as leases renew
   and from the expiration of certain leases.

        Other property  income, which  includes items  which tend to  fluctuate
   from period  to period,  such as  utility reimbursements,  telephone income,
   merchant  association dues,  lease termination  fees and  temporary occupant
   income, has risen from $4.6 million in  1991 to $4.7 million in 1992 to $5.5
   million in  1993.  Excluding centers  bought and sold during  the three year
   period, other property income  increased from $4.4  million in 1991 to  $4.6
   million in  1992 to  $4.8 million in  1993.   The increase  in 1993 was  due
   primarily to an increase in lease termination fees.

        Rental  expenses have  increased from  year to  year in  dollar amount,
   especially  in 1993  where $2.1  million  of the  increase is  due to  newly
   acquired centers.  However, rental expenses have remained fairly stable as a
   percentage  of property income (rental  income plus other  income); 21.9% in
   1991, 22.1%  in 1992 and 23.8% in 1993.   Of the expenses included in rental
   expense, the greatest changes have been in repairs and maintenance and other
   operating expenses.   Snow removal  expense is  the primary  reason for  the
   increase in repairs and maintenance. Other operating expenses have increased
   due to an increase in bad debt, environmental expense and marketing expenses
   for the centers.  Real estate taxes  have remained stable as a percentage of
   property income, at approximately 9.3%.

        Depreciation and amortization charges have increased from $21.9 million
   in 1991 to $23.0 million in 1992 to $25.4 million in 1993.  The  increase in
   1993  is due  to depreciation  on the  recent acquisitions  and renovations,
   while in  1992 the increase was  primarily due to increased  depreciation on
   Federal  Plaza, depreciation  on renovations  and increased  amortization of
   lease costs.

        Interest income  decreased from $5.5 million in 1992 to $3.9 million in
   1993  due  primarily    to  lower  cash  balances,  as  cash  was  used  for
   acquisitions, renovations,  and debt repayments.   Interest income increased


   from $4.7  million in 1991 to  $5.5 million in 1992,  despite lower interest
   rates  in 1992 since  average cash balances  were higher in 1992  due to the
   temporary investment of the proceeds of public offerings.

        Interest  expense has  decreased from  $35.2 million  in 1992  to $31.6
   million  in 1993, reflecting  the redemption of  the Senior Notes  and the 8
   3/4% convertible  subordinated  debentures,  the reduction  in  the  5  1/4%
   convertible subordinated debentures  due 2002 and the  prepayment of various
   mortgages, partially  offset  by interest  expense of  the revolving  credit
   facilities and interest  on the 5  1/4% convertible subordinated  debentures
   due 2003.   Interest expense decreased  from $38.1 million in  1991 to $35.2
   million in  1992  due primarily  to  the exchange  and  repurchase of  $56.2
   million of the Trust's  5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures  due 2002
   in 1991 and 1992.

        Administrative  expenses  have  ranged  from 3.6%  of  property  income
   (rental income plus other  income) in 1991 to 4.3% in 1992  to 4.2% in 1993.
   During the  worst  of  the recession  in  1991 the  Trust  reduced  overhead
   expenses by reducing the number of  employees and freezing or reducing  many
   salaries.  Employment practices have now returned to normal.

        Other  charges of $682,000 in  1992 is comprised of  two items.  One is
   the $960,000 writedown of an investment in Olympia and York notes, partially
   offset by the recovery of $278,000 of a legal settlement.

        Income  before gain  on  sale of  real  estate and  extraordinary  item
   increased $9.1 million  from 1992  to 1993, primarily  because of  increased
   revenue  from  recent acquisitions  and  redevelopments and  because  of the
   decrease in interest expense.  Income before gain on sale of real estate and
   extraordinary  item increased  $2.7 million  in  1992 from  1991  due to  an
   increase  in revenue coupled with  a decrease in  interest expense partially
   offset by  higher depreciation and amortization,  administrative expense and
   net other charges.  

        Gain  on sale of real  estate is dependent on  the extent and timing of
   sales.  The 1992 gain was primarily due to the sale of Sargent Road and 25th



   Street Shopping Centers.   The 1991 gain was on the sale of Lawrence Village
   Shopping Center.

        In  1993  the Trust  had  a  net gain  of  $2.0  million on  the  early
   extinguishment  of  debt,  resulting  from    a  $3.1 million  gain  on  the
   extinguishment of  the mortgage at Northeast Plaza,  offset by losses on the
   redemption of the  Senior Notes, convertible subordinated debentures and two
   mortgages.   In 1992  the Trust  had  a net  loss of  $58,000 on  the  early
   extinguishment of debt, resulting  from the prepayment of two  mortgages and
   the  exchange  and  repurchase  of  its  5  1/4%  convertible   subordinated
   debentures.   In  1991 the Trust  had a  net gain  of $415,000 on  the early
   extinguishment of  debt,  consisting of  a  gain on  the  repurchase of  the
   Trust's 5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 partially offset
   by  $587,000 in  prepayment  fees  on  the  early  extinguishment  of  three
   mortgages.

        As a  result of  the foregoing  items net income  was $18.1  million in
   1993, $9.4 million in 1992 and $5.8 million in 1991.

        Impact of New Accounting Standards

        In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
   No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities".
   This standard will be  effective for 1994 financial statements  and requires
   the  classification of  debt  and  equity  investments  into  one  of  three
   categories: held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-sale.  The Trust does
   not believe  that the implementation  of the  standard in 1994  will have  a
   material  effect on  the  Trust's  financial  statements since  the  Trust's
   current  accounting   for  debt  and  equity  investments  does  not  differ
   materially from the standard.

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
   CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   Trustees and Shareholders
   Federal Realty Investment Trust

   We  have audited  the accompanying  consolidated balance  sheets  of Federal
   Realty Investment  Trust as of December  31, 1993 and 1992,  and the related
   consolidated statements of operations,  shareholders' equity, and cash flows
   for each of  the three years in  the period ended December 31,  1993.  These
   financial  statements are the responsibility of the Trust's management.  Our
   responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
   on our audits.

      We  conducted our audits in  accordance with  generally accepted auditing
   standards.   Those standards require that  we plan and perform  the audit to
   obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the financial statements are free
   of material  misstatement.  An  audit includes examining,  on a test  basis,
   evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
   An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
   significant  estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
   financial  statement  presentation.    We  believe   our  audits  provide  a
   reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our  opinion,  the  financial statements  referred  to  above  present
   fairly, in  all material  respects, the  consolidated financial  position of
   Federal  Realty Investment Trust  as of December  31, 1993 and  1992 and the
   consolidated results of its  operations and its consolidated cash  flows for
   each  of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity
   with generally accepted accounting principles.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Federal Realty Investment Trust invests predominantly in income-producing real
   estate properties, primarily community and neighborhood shopping centers.

The Trust uses the straight-line method in providing for depreciation. 
   Estimated useful lives  range from three to 25  years on apartment buildings
   and  improvements, and  from  three  to 35  years  on shopping  centers  and
   improvements.  Maintenance  and repair  costs are charged  to operations  as
   incurred.  Major  improvements are capitalized.  The gain  or loss resulting
   from the sale of properties is included in net income.

The Trust capitalizes certain costs directly related to the acquisition,
   improvement  and leasing  of real estate  including applicable  salaries and
   other  related costs.   The  capitalized costs associated  with unsuccessful
   acquisitions are charged to operations when that determination is made.  The
   capitalized costs  associated with improvements and  leasing are depreciated
   or amortized over the life of the improvement and lease, respectively.

Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are capitalized and are
   amortized over  the life  of the  related issue  using the  interest method.
   Upon  conversion or in the event of redemption, applicable unamortized costs
   are charged to shareholders' equity or to operations, respectively.

The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
   estate  investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code
   (the "Code").  Under those sections,  a trust which distributes at least 95%
   of its  real estate trust taxable  income to its shareholders  each year and
   which meets  certain other conditions will  not be taxed on  that portion of
   its taxable  income which is distributed to its shareholders.  Therefore, no
   provision for Federal income taxes is required.


                                       F-12

The Trust consolidates the financial statements of nine partnerships and a
   joint venture  which are controlled by  the Trust.  The  equity interests of
   other investors are reflected as investors' interest in consolidated assets.
   All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.

The Trust estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using the
   following  methods and  assumptions: (1)  quoted market  prices are  used to
   estimate  the  fair  value of  investments  in  marketable  debt and  equity
   securities; (2)  quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of
   the Trust's marketable senior notes and convertible subordinated debentures;
   (3) discounted  cash flow analyses  are used to  estimate the fair  value of
   long term notes and mortgage notes receivable and payable, using the Trust's
   estimate of current interest  rates for similar notes; (4)  carrying amounts
   in the  balance  sheet  approximate  fair  value for  cash  and  short  term
   borrowings.  Notes  receivable from  officers are excluded  from fair  value
   estimation since they  have been  issued in connection  with employee  stock
   ownership programs. 

The Trust defines cash as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial
   institutions and  short term  liquid investments  with  an initial  maturity
   under three months.  Cash balances may exceed insurable amounts.

Earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares
   outstanding during the respective periods, including options.

                          =========       =========        =========


        The Trust's 48 shopping centers are located in twelve states, primarily
   along the East  Coast between the New  York metropolitan area and  Richmond,
   Virginia.   There are approximately 1,500  tenants providing a wide range of
   retail products and services.  These tenants range from sole proprietorships
   to national  retailers; no one tenant or corporate group of tenants accounts
   for 5% or more of revenue.

        The  Trust acquired seven shopping  centers and one  office building in
   1993.   Pan Am Shopping Center  in Fairfax, Virginia was  acquired for $21.6
   million in cash; Gaithersburg Square in Gaithersburg, Maryland was purchased
   for $11.0 million  in cash and  the assumption of  a $2.0 million  liability
   which is the estimated  cost to remediate certain preexisting  environmental
   issues; Quince  Orchard Plaza  in Gaithersburg,  Maryland and  its adjoining
   office building were purchased for $10.9 million in cash  and the assumption
   of  a   liability  of   approximately  $250,000  to   remediate  preexisting
   environmental issues; Crossroads Shopping  Center in Highland Park, Illinois
   was purchased  for $16.2  million in  cash; Bala  Cynwyd Shopping Center  in
   suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was purchased for $17.0 million in cash;
   Dedham  Plaza in Dedham, Massachusetts,  was purchased for  $25.0 million in
   cash  and the  assumption  of a  $250,000  liability to  remediate  existing
   environmental  issues;  and  the  leasehold  interest  in  Bethesda  Row  in
   Bethesda, Maryland was acquired with $6.2 million in cash.

        In  1992 the Trust purchased Ellisburg Circle Shopping Center in Cherry
   Hill,  New  Jersey for  $15.3  million in  cash.    In June  1992  the Trust
   terminated  a long  term  ground lease  by  purchasing the  land  underlying
   Wildwood Shopping Center,  located in Bethesda, Maryland,  for $9.1 million.
   In 1992  the Trust  purchased an  additional .3%  interest in Barracks  Road


                                       F-14

   Shopping Center  for $106,000, bringing the Trust's  ownership percentage to
   over 99%. 

        During  1992  the Trust  sold two  shopping  centers, the  Sargent Road
   Shopping  Center  in Hyattsville,  Maryland for  $1.9  million and  the 25th
   Street Shopping Center in Easton, Pennsylvania for $9.7 million.   The Trust
   received cash proceeds of  $10.3 million on these transactions,  realizing a
   gain of $2.7 million.

        Mortgage  notes receivable  consist  of three  notes collateralized  by
   shopping centers.  All three notes were issued in connection with either the
   acquisition or  sale of Trust properties.  The Trust estimates that the fair
   value of these notes at December 31, 1993 is $14.6 million compared to their
   book value of  $13.9 million, since the stated interest  rate on these notes
   is higher than current rates.   The Trust estimated  that the fair value  of
   these notes at December 31, 1992 approximated their  carrying value of $16.7
   million.

        In 1992  the Trust  placed a $30.0  million mortgage on  Federal Plaza,
   located in Rockville, Maryland.  The  mortgage bears interest beginning at 8
   1/4%,  which resets every  three years, with  a final maturity  on March 10,
   2001.

        The Trust prepaid a number of mortgages  in 1993 and 1992.  In 1993 the
   Trust prepaid the  mortgages on  the Laurel, Northeast  and Northeast  Plaza
   shopping centers,  resulting in a  net gain of  $2.9 million which  has been
   recorded as a component of the net gain on early extinguishment of debt.  In
   1992  the Trust  prepaid  mortgages  on  the Eastgate  and  Town  &  Country
   (Louisiana) shopping centers; the prepayment fees on these transactions were
   recorded as a component of the net loss on early extinguishment of debt.

        Mortgages payable and capital lease obligations are due in installments
   over  various terms extending to 2060  with actual or imputed interest rates
   ranging  from 7.9%  to 11.25%.   Certain of  the mortgage  and capital lease
   obligations  require  additional  interest  payments  based   upon  property
   performance.


                                       F-15

        The  fair value  of mortgages  payable  at December  31, 1993  is $86.7
   million compared  to the carrying value  of $81.2 million  since the current
   estimated interest rate used to  discount the cash flows is often  less than
   the stated rate.   The fair value of mortgages payable  at December 31, 1992
   was $124.3 million, compared to the carrying value of $120.0 million.

        Aggregate mortgage principal  payments due during  the next five  years
   are  $955,000, $1.0 million, $1.1  million, $1.3 million  and $43.7 million,
   respectively.

        Future minimum  lease payments  and their  present  value for  property
   under capital leases as of December 31, 1993 are as follows:

   Leasing Arrangements
   --------------------

        The  Trust's leases  with  shopping center  and  apartment tenants  are
   classified as  operating leases.   Leases on apartments are  generally for a
   period  of one  year, whereas  shopping center  leases generally  range from
   three to 10 years and usually  provide for contingent rentals based on sales
   and sharing of certain operating costs.

   NOTE 2. NOTES PAYABLE

        At December 31,  1993 the Trust had notes payable  of $30.5 million. Of
   the $30.5 million, $6.1 million was issued in connection with renovations of
   certain  Trust properties.   Of the  $6.1 million,  $3.0 million,  issued in
   connection  with a  lease at  Perring Plaza,  bears interest  at 10%  and is
   payable  in equal  monthly installments  with  a  final maturity  in January
   2013.  The majority of the  rest of the $6.1 million, incurred primarily  to
   fund the purchase and renovation of Federal Plaza, bears interest at 11% and
   matures in 1996.  Due to decreases in interest rates since these notes  were
   issued the fair value of these notes at December 31, 1993 is estimated to be
   $6.8 million  compared to the carrying  value of $6.1 million.   At December
   31, 1992  the fair  value of  these notes  was  $6.5 million  compared to  a
   carrying value of $6.1 million.

        At December 31, 1993 the  Trust had $70.0 million of unsecured  medium-
   term revolving credit  facilities with  three banks.   All three  facilities
   require fees and have covenants requiring a minimum shareholders' equity and
   a  maximum ratio  of debt  to  net worth.    The maximum  drawn under  these
   facilities during 1993 was $64.1 million and at December 31,  1993 there was
   $24.4 million outstanding,  bearing interest at rates from 4.2%  to 5%.  The
   average  weighted interest rate on borrowings  during 1993 was 4.2%, and the
   average  amount outstanding was $6.6  million.   The carrying value and fair
   value of these short term borrowings are the same.



                                       F-18

        At  December 31, 1992  the Trust had  $20.0 million available  under an
   unsecured line  of credit;  there were  no amounts drawn  under the  line at
   December 31,  1992.    The  line,  which was  replaced  by  the  medium-term
   revolving facilities, bore interest at prime plus 1/2% (6.5% at December 31,
   1992), and replaced  a secured $20.0 million line.   The maximum drawn under
   the lines in 1992 was  $8.5 million, the weighted average interest  rate was
   7.2%, and the average amount outstanding was $708,000.

        At December  31,  1991, notes  payable included  $8.5 million  borrowed
   under the $20.0  million secured line  of credit.   The maximum drawn  under
   this secured  line during 1991  was $20.0 million,  with a  weighted average
   interest rate of 8.2% and an average amount outstanding of $19.6 million.

   NOTE 3. DIVIDENDS
         
        On November 18, 1993 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of
   $.39 per  share, payable January 14, 1994  to shareholders of record January
   3, 1994.  For the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992  and 1991, $.45, $.915
   and $.66 of  dividends paid per share, respectively, represented a return of
   capital.


   NOTE 4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

        Pursuant to the  provisions of the Loehmann's Plaza Limited Partnership
   Agreement, on or after September 1, 1995 the Limited Partner may require the
   Trust to  purchase his interest in  the Partnership at its  then fair market
   value.

        The  Congressional  Plaza  Shopping  Center  Joint  Venture   Agreement
   provides that  the Trust may be  required to purchase its  pro-rata share of
   one venturer's 22.5% or greater joint venture  interest for a purchase price
   based on the appraised fair market value of the shopping center, but no less
   than the percentage  of joint venture interest being  sold multiplied by the
   difference  between $17.5 million and the remaining principal balance of any
   liabilities of the Joint Venture.


                                       F-19

        The  State of New  Jersey Division of  Taxation has assessed  the Trust
   $364,000  in taxes,  penalty and interest  for the years  1985 through 1990,
   since the State has disallowed the dividends paid deduction in computing New
   Jersey taxable income.  The Trust has filed a complaint in  the Tax Court of
   New  Jersey contesting the  assessment, since the Trust  believes that it is
   entitled to the  deduction.  At  this time,  the outcome of  this matter  is
   unknown.

        The  North Carolina Department  of the Environment,  Health and Natural
   Resources issued a Notice of Violation ("NOV")  against a dry cleaner tenant
   at  Eastgate Shopping  Center in  Chapel Hill,  North Carolina  concerning a
   spill at the  shopping center.  As  owner of the shopping  center, the Trust
   was named in and  received a copy  of the NOV.   Estimates to remediate  the
   spill range from $300,000 to $500,000.  An agreement is being drawn with two
   previous owners of the shopping center to share the costs to remediate.  The
   Trust has recorded  a liability of  $120,000 as its  estimated share of  the
   cleanup costs.

        Contaminants at levels in  excess of New Jersey cleanup  standards were
   identified at a shopping  center in New Jersey.   The Trust has  retained an
   environmental consultant  to investigate  the contamination.   The  Trust is
   also evaluating whether it has insurance coverage for this matter.   At this
   time, the Trust  is unable to determine what the  range of remediation costs
   might be.  The  Trust has also identified chlorinated  solvent contamination
   at  two other  properties.  In  each case,  the contamination  appears to be
   linked to  the current and/or  previous dry cleaner.   The Trust  intends to
   look to the responsible parties  for any remediation effort.  Evaluation  of
   these situations  is preliminary and it is  impossible to estimate the range
   of remediation costs, if any.

        The Trust reserved  $2.25 million at  closing for environmental  issues
   principally associated  with  the  recently  acquired  Gaithersburg  Square.
   Pursuant to an indemnity agreement entered into with the  seller at closing,
   the  Trust agreed  to  take  certain  actions  with  respect  to  identified
   chlorinated solvent  contamination.   The seller  indemnified the  Trust for
   certain  third   party  claims   and  government  requirements   related  to
   contamination at adjacent properties.

                                       F-20

        The  Trust's  non  real  estate  investments  consist  of  $524,000  in
   marketable equity securities  and $3.5  million of Olympia  and York  Senior
   First  Mortgage Notes.    The marketable  equity  securities are  stated  at
   market.    The  Olympia  and  York  notes  were  written  down  in  1992  to
   management's best estimate of the  net realizable value.  The writedown  was
   recorded  in the  Consolidated Statements  of Operations  as a  component of
   other  charges, which also included  an insurance recovery  of $278,000 of a
   settlement of a personal injury lawsuit.

        The  Trust has  entered  into  agreements  with certain  key  employees
   whereby if these employees voluntarily or involuntarily leave the employment
   of  the Trust  within six  months after  a "change  of control"  (defined as
   control  of 35% or  more of outstanding  shares) of the  Trust, they will be
   entitled to a lump sum cash payment equal to one to three times their annual
   salary  as of  the date  of termination  and have  their health  and welfare
   benefits  and executive privileges  continued for a  period of  one to three
   years.  In the event of a change of control, the Trust also agreed  that all
   restrictions on  the exercise  or receipt  of  any stock  options and  stock
   grants shall lapse  upon termination of employment and that all shares owned
   at termination shall be redeemed by the Trust at a formula price.

        As of  December 31, 1993  in connection with the  renovation of certain
   shopping centers,  the Trust has  contractual obligations  of $2.0  million.
   The Trust  is also contractually obligated to provide up to $8.4 million for
   tenant improvements and $1.8 million to buy out tenant leases.

        The  Trust  is  obligated  under  ground  lease agreements  on  several
   shopping centers requiring minimum annual payments as follows:

                                                                 (in thousands)

   NOTE 5: SENIOR NOTES

        In April 1993 the Trust called its 8.65% Senior Notes for redemption on
   May 14, 1993 at a  price of $1010 per note, for a total  redemption price of
   $50.5 million.   The redemption premium and unamortized loan costs have been
   recorded as a loss on the early extinguishment of debt.  The market value of
   these notes at December 31, 1992 was $50.8 million.


   NOTE 6: 8 3/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

        The  Trust redeemed $173,000 principal amount of its 8 3/4% convertible
   subordinated  debentures at a  price of  $1017.50 per  debenture or  a total
   price of $176,000 on March 15, 1993.  The balance of the debentures that had
   been  outstanding were converted into  shares of beneficial  interest at $16
   per  share.  At December  31, 1992 $2.4  million of these  debentures with a
   market value of $3.7 million were outstanding.


   NOTE 7: 5 1/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE 2002

        At  December 31, 1993 and 1992 the  Trust had outstanding $40.2 million
   and  $43.8  million,  respectively,   of  5  1/4%  convertible  subordinated
   debentures  due 2002.   The debentures which are  convertible into shares of
   beneficial  interest  at $30.625  per share  were  not registered  under the
   Securities Act of 1933  and were not publicly distributed  within the United
   States.

        During  1993 the  Trust  purchased $3.7  million  of these  debentures,
   resulting in a  loss of $74,000  which has been recorded  as a component  of
   the net gain on early extinguishment of debt.  In 1992, the Trust  exchanged
   $22.6 million  principal amount of the debentures for 1.3 million shares and
   purchased an additional $21.2 million principal amount.


                                       F-22

        The debentures are redeemable at the option of the Trust; however,  the
   debentures may not  be redeemed prior to April 30,  1994, unless the closing
   market price per share  has been at least 130% of the  conversion price then
   in  effect  for a  specified  period prior  to  notice of  redemption.   The
   debentures are redeemable at the option of the holders on April  30, 1994 at
   a  redemption  price equal  to  120% of  their  principal amount.   Interest
   expense is accrued at 7.53% to record the premium put.  The accretion of the
   premium was approximately $1.5 million in 1993 and $1.6 million in 1992.  In
   1993  and  1992, $671,000  and $5.6  million,  respectively, of  the accrued
   premium was retired upon the repurchase of the debentures.   At December 31,
   1993 the carrying  value of the debentures plus the  premium accrued to date
   is $47.7 million; the  market value is $48.0 million.   At December 31, 1992
   the  carrying value of debentures plus the  premium accrued to that date was
   $50.6 million with a market value of $50.9 million.


   NOTE 8: 5 1/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE 2003

        In  October 1993 the Trust issued $75.0  million of 5 1/4%  convertible
   subordinated  debentures,  realizing  cash proceeds  of  approximately $73.0
   million.  The  debentures were not  registered under  the Securities Act  of
   1933,  and were  not  publicly distributed  within the  United States.   The
   debentures,  which mature in 2003, are convertible into shares of beneficial
   interest at $36 per share.   The debentures are redeemable by the  Trust, in
   whole, at any  time after October 28,  1998 at 100% of  the principal amount
   plus accrued interest.   The market value of the  debentures at December 31,
   1993 was $71.5 million.


   NOTE 9: SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

        In April 1993 the Trust sold 2.8  million shares of beneficial interest
   in a  public offering, raising net  proceeds of $72.8 million.   In December
   1993 the Trust sold 220,000 shares  for $5.4 million in a private  placement
   in connection  with the long-term  lease of a  property.   In June 1992  the
   Trust sold  3.4 million shares in a public offering, raising net proceeds of
   $66.5 million, and in  1991 the Trust  sold 2.5 million  shares in a  public

                                       F-23

   offering, receiving net  proceeds of $42.2 million.   The proceeds were used
   for debt retirement and property acquisitions and renovations.

        The Trust has  a Dividend Reinvestment  Plan, whereby shareholders  may
   use their dividends to purchase shares; the plan was amended in 1991 so that
   shares purchased under the plan would be newly issued shares.  In March 1993
   the  Trust registered an additional  500,000 shares with  the Securities and
   Exchange Commission in connection with the plan.

        In January  1991 the  Trustees  adopted the  Federal Realty  Investment
   Trust  Share Purchase  Plan.   Under the  terms of  this plan,  officers and
   certain  employees of the Trust  purchased 446,000 common  shares at $15.125
   per share with the assistance  of loans of $6.7 million from the Trust.  One
   sixteenth of the loan is forgiven each year for  eight years, as long as the
   officer or employee is still  employed by the Trust.   The Trust has  loaned
   participants $506,000 to pay the taxes due in connection with the plan.  The
   purchase  loans and  the  tax loans  bear  interest at  9.39%.   The  shares
   purchased under the plan may not be sold, pledged or assigned until both the
   purchase and tax loans are satisfied and the eight year  period has expired.


        Under the terms of the 1988 Share Bonus Plan, 78,000  shares and 30,000
   shares  were  granted to  officers  and  key  employees in  1988  and  1989,
   respectively.   During the  years ended  December 31, 1993,  1992 and  1991,
   4,000 shares, 22,500 shares and 23,500 shares, respectively, were vested and
   charged to operations.  In connection  with these shares, the Trust has made
   loans to the participants  to pay the taxes due in connection with the plan.
   The notes bear interest at the  lesser of (i) the Trust's borrowing  rate or
   (ii)  the  Trust's current  indicated annual  dividend  rate divided  by the
   purchase  price of  such shares.   Notes  issued under  this plan  are being
   forgiven over three years from issuance if the officer is  still employed by
   the  Trust.   During the  years  ended December  31, 1993,  1992, and  1991,
   $80,000, $60,000 and $176,000, respectively, was forgiven.

        In  connection with a restricted  share grant, the  Trust accepted from
   the President a non-interest  bearing note for $210,000.  One installment of


                                       F-24

   $105,000  was paid on  the note in  1992 and  the second installment  is due
   April 15, 1996.

        The Trust owns shares of other real estate investment trusts as a long-
   term investment.  The Trust's cost of these shares was $887,000.  Due to the
   price  decline of  certain of  these investments,  the Trust  established an
   allowance  for the unrealized loss  which was $364,000  in 1993, $385,000 in
   1992, and $465,000 in 1991.

        At December 31,  1993, 1992 and  1991, the Trust  had 60,200 shares  in
   treasury at a cost of $1.1 million.

        On April  13, 1989, the Trustees adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (the
   Plan).   Under the Plan, one right  was issued for each outstanding share of
   common stock held as of April 24, 1989, and a right will be attached to each
   share  issued in the future.  The  rights are exercisable into common shares
   upon the occurrence of certain events, including acquisition by a  person or
   group of certain levels of beneficial ownership or a tender offer  by such a
   person or group.  The Rights are redeemable by the Trust for $.01 and expire
   on April 24, 1999.

   NOTE 10: STOCK OPTION PLAN

        The 1993 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Plan") was approved by shareholders
   in May  1993.   On the  date of  approval, 472,500  options were  awarded to
   officers,  employees and  non-employee Trustees.   Under  the Plan,  on each
   annual meeting  date during the term of  the plan, each non-employee Trustee
   will be  awarded 2,500 options.   On December 16, 1993,  69,000 options were
   awarded to employees.

        The option price  to acquire shares  under the  1993 Plan and  previous
   plans is required to be a least the fair market value at the date  of grant.
   As a result of  the exercise of options, the Trust  has outstanding from its
   officers and employees notes for 
   $1.1  million.  The  notes bear interest  at the  lesser of (i)  the Trust's
   borrowing rate  or (ii) the  current indicated  annual dividend rate  on the
   shares  acquired pursuant to  the option, divided  by the  purchase price of
   such  shares.   The notes  are  collateralized by  the shares  and are  with
   recourse.

   NOTE 11: SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN

        The Trust  has a  savings and  retirement plan  in accordance  with the
   provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.   Under the plan,
   the Trust out of its current  net income, contributed 50% of each employee's
   contribution.   Employees' contributions  range, at  the discretion  of each
   employee, from 1%  to 5% of compensation.   In addition, the Trust  may make
   discretionary contributions  within the limits of deductibility set forth by
   the Code.  All full-time employees of the Trust are eligible to become  plan
   participants.   The Trust's expense  for the years ended  December 31, 1993,
   1992, and 1991 was $133,000, $100,000, and $82,000, respectively.


   NOTE 12: INTEREST EXPENSE

        The  Trust incurred  interest  expense totalling  $31.8 million,  $35.4
   million and  $39.0 million in  1993, 1992 and  1991, respectively, of  which
   $216,000, $237,000  and $892,000,  respectively, was capitalized.   Interest
   paid was $31.4 million, $36.9 million and $37.1 million, respectively.


   NOTE 13: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

        In February  1994 the  Trust borrowed  $22.5 million  from a bank;  the
   loan,  which is  secured by  Northeast Plaza,  bears interest  at 150  basis

                                       F-27

   points over LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) and is due  on January 31,
   1995.  Proceeds from this borrowing were used to  pay down the borrowings on
   the revolving credit facilities.

        In February 1994 the Trust obtained a fourth revolving credit facility.
   This facility, which  is for $15.0  million and has terms  substantially the
   same  as the Trust's other  revolving credit facilities,  brings the Trust's
   total availability of revolving credit facilities to $85.0 million.


   NOTE 14: QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)

        The following summary  represents the  results of  operations for  each
   quarter in 1993 and 1992:

     March 31             $25,109      $1,703            $.08
     June 30               24,114       2,244             .10
     September 30          24,493       3,580             .15
     December 31           26,481       1,903             .08

   (a) Quarterly per  share results are affected by the  market price of common
   share equivalents in the calculation of earnings per share.

        The increases  in revenue in  1993 over 1992  are primarily due  to the
   acquisition  of  new  properties  in  late 1992  and  1993  and  due  to the
   contributions  of recently renovated centers.  These increases in revenue as
   well as  decreases in  interest expense  are the principal  reasons for  the
   increases in net income and earnings per share in 1993  as compared to 1992.
   The 1993  increases in net income  and earnings per share in  the second and

                                       F-28

   third quarters would have  been larger but for  the fact that in 1992  there
   was a gain on sale of real estate of $642,000 ($.03 per share) in the second
   quarter and  of $1.9  million ($.08  per share) in  the third  quarter.   In
   addition during  the fourth  quarter of 1993,  the Trust had  a gain  on the
   early retirement of debt of $3.0 million ($.11 per share).

                     FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FOOTNOTES

   (1)  These  notes receivable from Mr. Guttman and other officers were issued
        in connection with various stock grants and exercises of stock options.
        Certain notes are interest free and  certain notes bear interest at the
        lesser of (i)  the Trust's borrowing rate  or (ii) the Trust's  current
        indicated annual dividend  rate divided  by the purchase  price of  the
        shares.  The notes,  which are collateralized  by common shares of  the
        Trust, have maturity  dates ranging from  April 1994 through  September
        1998.  The  notes that  were issued in  connection with shares  granted
        under the  1988 Share Bonus  Plan are  being forgiven over  three years
        from  issuance if the officer is still employed by the Trust.  In 1991,
        1992 and  1993, notes for  $176,000, $60,000 and  $80,000 respectively,
        were forgiven.


   (2)  In 1991  the Share Purchase Plan was adopted by the Trustees; under the
        terms of  this plan officers  and certain employees  of the  Trust were
        offered  the opportunity to purchase 446,000 common shares of the Trust
        with  the assistance  of loans  of $6.7  million from  the Trust.   One
        sixteenth or  $421,000, of  the loans  will be  forgiven each year  for
        eight years.  The first sixteenth was forgiven upon purchase in January
        1991, another 16th in January 1992 and the next 16th was accelerated to

   pursuant to Section 2.1 by giving the Bank notice (which notice may be given
   by telephone  by an Authorized Person if promptly confirmed in writing by an
   Authorized Person)  not later than  10:00 A.M.  (Eastern Time) at  least two
   Business Days before  the date of the proposed loan  specifying (i) the date
   of the  proposed loan (which must be a Business  Day), (ii) the amount to be

   Based Rate of the Euro-Dollar-Based Rate and (iv) in the case of a  proposed

   Period applicable thereto.   The Bank shall  (unless it determines that  any
   applicable  condition specified  in this  Agreement has not  been satisfied)
   make the amount to be borrowed available to the Borrower not later than 2:00
   P.M.  (Eastern Time) on  the date of  the proposed loan  by wire transfer of
   such funds to such  account as the Borrower shall specify in its request for
   such Advance.

      Section 2.3. The  Note.  The Advances shall be evidenced by, and shall be
   repayable with interest in  accordance with, a single note  substantially in
   the form of Exhibit A hereto and appropriately completed (the  "Note").  The
   Bank shall record on its  books, and prior to any transfer of the Note shall
   make  on  the  schedule forming  a  part  thereof  appropriate notations  to
   evidence, the date  and amount of each  Advance and the  date and amount  of
   each  payment  of  principal made  by  the  Borrower  with respect  thereto;
   provided, however, that any failure  of the Bank to make such a  notation or
   any  error therein  shall not  in any  manner affect  the obligation  of the
   Borrower to  repay the Advances  in accordance with  the terms of  the Note.
   The  Borrower  hereby  irrevocably  authorizes  the  Bank   to  record  such
   information and to make such notations.

      Section 2.4. Interest Rates.  

       (a)  If the Borrower elects, or this Agreement  otherwise provides, that
   an  Advance shall bear interest at  the Prime-Based Rate, such Advance shall
   bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from
   and  including the date on  which such Advance is  made to but excluding the
   date on which such  Advance is due, at a  rate per annum equal to  the Prime
   Rate  for such  day minus  1.00%.   The Prime-Based  Rate shall  be adjusted

                                       F-60

   automatically on  and as of the  effective date of  any change in  the Prime
   Rate.  All such interest shall be payable on the first day of each month.

       (b)  If the Borrower  elects that an Advance shall  bear interest at the
   Euro-Dollar-Based Rate, such Advance shall bear interest on  the outstanding
   principal  amount  thereof, for  each  day  during  the applicable  Interest
   Period, at a rate per  annum equal to the  sum of 1.00% plus the  applicable
   Adjusted London Interback  Offered Rate.  All such interest shall be payable
   on the first day of each month.

       (c)  At maturity (whether  upon acceleration or otherwise), or  upon the
   occurrence and during the  continuation of an  Event of default, the  unpaid
   principal amount  of and  all accrued  but unpaid interest  on the  Advances
   shall automatically bear interest  for each day at a rate per annum equal to
   the sum of 4.75% plus the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (assuming a
   one-month Interest Period) for such day.

      Section 2.5. Method of Electing Interest Rates.  

      (a)  Each Advance  shall  bear interest  initially  at  the type  of  rate
   specified by the  Borrower in the  applicable notice  delivered to the  Bank

   elect to  change or continue  the type of  interest rate applicable  to such
   Advance (subject in each case to the provisions of Article VIII) as follows:

        (i)    if such Advance is bearing interest at the Prime-Based Rate, the
    Borrower may elect to change  the applicable rate to  the Euro-Dollar-Based
    Rate as of any Business Day;

        (ii)   if  such Advance  is bearing  interest at  the Euro-Dollar-Based
    Rate, the Borrower  may elect to change  the applicable rate to  the Prime-
    Based Rate, or may elect to continue such Advance  at the Euro-Dollar-Based
    Rate for an additional  Interest Period, in each case beginning on the last
    day of the then applicable Interest Period;

        (iii)  if such Advance is bearing interest at the Prime-Based Rate, the
    Borrower may elect to  designate such Advance as any combination  of Prime-

                                       F-61

    Based  Advances  or  Euro-Dollar-Based  Advances  as  of  any Business  Day
    (subject to the definition of Interest Period); and

        (iv)   if  such Advance  is bearing  interest at  the Euro-Dollar-Based
    Rate,  the Borrower may elect to  designate such Advance as any combination
    of Prime-Based  Advances or Euro-Dollar-Based Advances  as of  the last day
    of the  then  applicable Interest  Period  (subject  to the  definition  of
    Interest Period).

   The Borrower shall  make each such  election by delivering  a notice to  the
   Bank not  later than 10:00  A.M. (Eastern Time)  at least two  Business Days
   before  the new  type of  interest  rate or  the additional  Interest Period
   selected in such notice is to begin.

       (b)  Each  notice  of  interest  rate  election  delivered  pursuant  to
   subsection  (a) above shall specify with respect to each outstanding Advance
   to which such notice applies:

        (i)    the date on  which the new type  of interest rate  or additional
    Interest Period  selected in such  notice is to  begin, which shall  comply
    with the applicable clauses of subsection (a) above;

        (ii)   if the type of interest rate applicable to such Advance is to be
    changed, the new type  of interest rate selected and, if the new  rate is a
    Euro-Dollar-Based Rate, the duration of the initial Interest Period;

        (iii)    if such  Advance is  currently bearing interest  at the  Euro-
    Dollar-Based Rate and such type of interest rate is to be  continued for an
    additional  Interest  Period,  the duration  of  such  additional  Interest
    Period; and

        (iv)    if such Advance is to be designated  as a combination of Prime-
    Based  Advances and  Euro-Dollar-Based Advances,  the information specified
    in clauses (i) through (iii) above as to each such Prime-Based Advance  and

   Each  Interest Period  specified in  such notice  of interest  rate election
   shall comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

       (c)  If the Borrower  fails to deliver a timely  notice of interest rate
   election pursuant to subsection (a)  above selecting a new type of  interest
   rate  for an additional  Interest Period for  any Euro-Dollar-Based Advance,
   such Euro-Dollar-Based Advance shall  bear interest at the Euro-Dollar-Based
   Rate (assuming a  one-month Interest Period) commencing  on the last  day of
   the then current Interest Period (and continuing until the Borrower elects a
   different  type of  interest  rate  for  such Euro-Dollar-Based  Advance  as
   provided in this Section 2.5).

      Section 2.6. Prepayment of Advances.  

       (a)  The Borrower  may prepay the  Prime-Based Advances in  whole or  in
   part at any time or  from time to time by paying the principal  amount to be
   prepaid plus accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment.

       (b)  The Borrower may prepay the Euro-Dollar-Based Advances in  whole or
   in  part at  any time  or from  time by  paying the  principal amount  to be
   prepaid plus accrued interest  thereon to the date of  prepayment; provided,
   however, that the Borrower shall reimburse the Bank on  demand in accordance
   with Section 2.11 for any actual  loss or reasonable expense incurred by the
   Bank as  a result of the Borrower's repayment of a Euro-Dollar-Based Advance
   other than on the last day of the applicable Interest Period.

       (c)  If  on any date  the aggregate unpaid principal  amount of Advances
   outstanding on such date exceeds $15,000,000, the Borrower shall immediately
   prepay the Advances in an amount equal to such excess.

      Section 2.7. Late Charges.  If the Borrower fails to  make any payment of
   interest  on the Advances, or fails to pay  any fee or other amount due with
   respect to the Advances, within 10 Business Days after the date such payment
   was due, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank on demand a late charge equal to
   5.00% of the amount of such  payment.  If the Borrower has not  received, on
   or before  the last day  of any  calendar month, a  statement from the  Bank
   setting  forth the  interest  then due  with respect  to  the Advances,  the

                                       F-63

   Borrower shall estimate the amount of such interest in good  faith and shall
   pay such amount  to the Bank (and the Borrower shall not incur a late charge
   if  such amount is paid within 10 Business Days after the date such interest
   payment was due).  If the Borrower thereafter receives a  statement from the
   Bank setting  forth the interest then  due with respect to  the Advances and
   the  amount  of such  interest  exceeds the  estimated  payment made  by the
   Borrower, the  Borrower shall, upon  its receipt of  such statement, pay  an
   amount equal to  such excess to the Bank.  This  charge shall be in addition
   to,  and not  in lieu  of, any  other remedy  the Bank  may  have and  is in
   addition to any reasonable fees and charges of any agents or attorneys which
   the Bank is entitled to employ on any default  hereunder, whether authorized
   herein, or by law.

      Section 2.8. Non-Usage Fee.  The  Borrower shall pay to  the Bank on  the
   fifteenth day of  January, April, July and October of  each year, commencing
   April  15, 1994, a  non-usage fee  equal to 0.25%  per annum  of the average
   daily Available Amount during the preceding calendar quarter.

      Section 2.9. General  Provisions as to Payments.  The Borrower shall make
   each payment of principal of and  interest on the Advances (and each payment
   of a non-usage fee or late charge) not later than 11:00 A.M. (Eastern  Time)
   on the  date when due, in  federal or other immediately  available funds, to
   the  Bank at  the Bank's  address specified  in Section  9.1.   Whenever any
   payment of principal of  or interest on  the Advances (or  any payment of  a
   non-usage fee or late charge)  is due on a day which is not  a Business Day,
   the  date for  payment  thereof shall  be extended  to  the next  succeeding
   Business Day.  If the  date for any payment of principal of the Advances (or
   the date for any payment of  a non-usage fee or late charge) is  extended by
   operation  of law or otherwise,  interest thereon shall  be payable for such
   extended time.

      Section 2.10.  Extension  of the Line  of Credit  Period.   The Bank shall
   review the Line of  Credit Commitment on or  before January 1 of  each year,
   commencing January 1, 1995,  and may, in  its sole and absolute  discretion,
   extend the Line  of Credit Period from  time to time  for an additional  one
   year period.  The Bank shall have the unconditional right  not to extend the


                                       F-64

   Line of Credit Period, notwithstanding that no Event of Default exists.  The
   Bank shall notify the Borrower on or before January 1 of each
   year, commencing January 1, 1995, whether the Bank has elected to extend the
   Line of Credit Period.

      Section 2.11.  Funding Losses.   If (i)  the Borrower  makes any principal
   payment with respect to the Euro-Dollar-Based Advances on any day other than
   the last  day of the applicable  Interest Period (pursuant to  Article II or
   VIII or otherwise), (ii) the Borrower converts Euro-Dollar-Based Advances to
   Prime-Based Advances  on any day other  than the last day  of the applicable
   Interest  Period (pursuant  to  Article  VIII  or  otherwise)  or  (iii) the
   Borrower  fails to borrow a Euro-Dollar-Based Advance in accordance with any
   loan  request delivered  to the  Bank in  accordance  with Section  2.2, the
   Borrower  shall  reimburse  the Bank  on  demand  for  any  actual  loss  or
   reasonable  expense  incurred  by  the  Bank as  a  result  of  such  event,
   including, without  limitation, any loss incurred  in obtaining, liquidating
   or employing  deposits from third  parties.  The  Bank shall deliver  to the
   Borrower a certificate showing the calculation of the amount of such loss or
   reasonable  expense, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of
   manifest error.   The Bank may use any reasonable  averaging and attribution
   methods in calculating such loss or reasonable expense.

      Section 2.12.  Optional Termination  or Reduction  of the  Line of  Credit
   Commitment.   The Borrower may, upon  at least 45 days' notice  to the Bank,
   (i) terminate the  Line  of  Credit Commitment  or  (ii) reduce  the  unused
   portion of  the Line of Credit Commitment from time  to time by an aggregate
   amount  of $3,000,000  or  any integral  multiple  of $1,000,000  in  excess
   thereof;  provided, however, that the  Borrower may not  terminate or reduce
   the Line of Credit  Commitment on or before January 1,  1995; and, provided,
   further, that the Borrower may not  terminate the Line of Credit  Commitment
   at any  time that any Euro-Dollar-Based  Advance is outstanding and  may not
   reduce the Line  of Credit Commitment on  any date below an amount  equal to
   the    aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount  of  Euro-Dollar-Based  Advances
   outstanding on such date.

                          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      The Borrower represents and warrants that:

      Section 4.1. Existence  and Power.   The  Borrower  is an  unincorporated
   business trust, validly existing and in  good standing under the laws of the
   District of Columbia, has all powers and all material governmental licenses,
   authorizations,  consents and approvals required to carry on its business as
   now conducted and  is not a "foreign person" within  the meaning of sections
   1445 and 7701 of the Code.  The Borrower is duly qualified or licensed to do
   business in each jurisdiction  where qualification or licensing  is required
   by the nature of its business or the character and location of its property,
   business or customers and in which the failure to so qualify or be licensed,
   as the case may  be, in the aggregate, could have a  material adverse effect
   on  the business, financial position, results of operations or properties of
   the Borrower.

      Section 4.2. Authorization;  Non-Contravention.   The execution, delivery
   and performance  by the Borrower of  this Agreement and the  Note are within
   its power,  have been duly  authorized by all  necessary action,  require no
   action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or
   official and do not contravene, or constitute (with or without the giving of
   notice  or lapse  of  time  or  both)  a default  under,  any  provision  of
   applicable law  or of the declaration of trust or  bylaws of the Borrower or
   of  any agreement, judgment,  injunction, order, decree  or other instrument
   binding  upon or  affecting  the  Borrower  or result  in  the  creation  or
   imposition of any Lien on any of its assets.

      Section 4.3. Binding  Effect.   This Agreement  constitutes  a valid  and
   binding agreement of the Borrower and the  Note, when executed and delivered
   in  accordance  with this  Agreement, will  constitute  a valid  and binding
   obligation of the Borrower, in each case enforceable against the Borrower in
   accordance  with  its terms,  except as  (i)  the enforceability  hereof and
   thereof may be limited  by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar  laws affecting
   creditors'  rights  generally  and  (ii)  rights  of  acceleration  and  the

                                       F-68

   availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of
   general applicability.

      Section 4.4. Litigation.  Except as disclosed in the  Borrower's Form 10-
   Q  for the quarter  ended September 30, 1993  filed with  the Securities and
   Exchange Commission, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending against,
   or to  the knowledge of  the Borrower threatened  against or affecting,  the
   Borrower or  any of  its subsidiaries  before any  federal,  state or  local
   government,  authority, agency, court or  other body, officer  or entity, or
   before any arbitrator with authority to bind a party at  law, in which there
   is a reasonable possibility  of a decision which could  materially adversely
   affect the business, financial position, results of operations or properties
   of the  Borrower or which in any manner draws  into question the validity of
   this Agreement or the Note, and there is no  basis known to the Borrower for
   any such action, suit or proceeding.

      Section 4.5. Filings.  All  actions by or in respect  of, and all filings
   with,  any governmental body, agency or official required in connection with
   the execution, delivery and performance of  this Agreement and the Note,  or
   necessary for the  validity or enforceability hereof and thereof  or for the
   protection or perfection of  the rights and interests of the  Bank hereunder
   and thereunder, will, prior to the date of delivery hereof  or thereof, have
   been  duly taken  or  made, as  the  case  may be,  and  will at  all  times
   thereafter remain in full force and effect.

      Section 4.6. Financial Information.

      (a)  The  audited balance sheet  of the  Borrower as  of December 31, 1992
   and  the   related  audited  statements   of  operations,  cash   flows  and
   shareholders' equity for  the fiscal year then  ended, copies of  which have
   been delivered  to the Bank,  fairly present,  in conformity with  GAAP, the
   financial  position of  the Borrower  as  of such  date and  its results  of
   operations  and cash flows  for such fiscal  year.  As  of the date  of such
   financial  statements, the  Borrower did  not have  any  material contingent
   obligation, contingent  liability, liability  for taxes, long-term  lease or
   unusual forward or  long-term commitment  which is not  reflected in any  of
   such financial statements or in the notes thereto.

                                       F-69

      (b)  The unaudited balance sheet of the  Borrower as of September 30, 1993
   and  the   related  unaudited  statements  of  operations,  cash  flows  and
   shareholders'  equity for the calendar  quarter then ended,  copies of which
   have been  delivered to the  Bank, fairly  present, in conformity  with GAAP
   applied on a basis consistent  with the financial statements referred to  in
   subsection (a) above, the financial position of the Borrower as of such date
   and its  results of  operations and  cash  flows for  each calendar  quarter
   (subject to normal year-end adjustments).

      (c)  Since September 30, 1993, there has  been no material adverse  change
   in  the business, financial position, results of operations or properties of
   the Borrower.

      Section 4.7. ERISA Compliance.   Each member of  the Controlled Group has
   fulfilled its obligations under  the minimum funding standards of  ERISA and
   the  Code with respect  to each  Plan and is  in compliance  in all material
   respects with  the provisions of ERISA and  the Code presently applicable to
   each  Plan, and has not incurred or does  not reasonably expect to incur any
   liability to the PBGC or a Plan under Title  IV of ERISA.  The execution and
   delivery of this Agreement and the issuance of the Note will not involve any
   transaction which  is subject to the prohibitions of Section 406 of ERISA or
   in connection with which a  tax would be imposed pursuant to section 4975 of
   the Code.  No Lien has been attached, and no Person has threatened to attach
   a Lien,  on any  property of  the Borrower  as  a result  of the  Borrower's
   failure to comply with ERISA.

      Section 4.8. Environmental Compliance.

      (a)  Except as  described in Schedule 4.8  or disclosed  in the Borrower's
   Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1993 filed with the Securities
   and Exchange Commission, neither the Borrower nor any of its subsidiaries is
   (i) in default  with respect to any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
   court or (ii) in default in any respect under any Environmental Requirement,
   which  default  is likely  to  materially  adversely  affect  the  business,
   financial  position, results of operations or properties of the Borrower and
   its subsidiaries.


                                       F-70

      (b)  Except as  described in Schedule 4.8  or disclosed  in the Borrower's
   Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1993 filed with the Securities
   and Exchange Commission, (i) the Borrower and each of its subsidiaries is in
   compliance  in  all  material  respects with  all  applicable  Environmental
   Requirements   and  state  and  federal  health   and  safety  statutes  and
   regulations, other than violations that are unlikely to materially adversely
   affect the business, financial position, results of operations or properties
   of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, and (ii) to the best of the Borrower's
   knowledge, neither the  Borrower nor any of its subsidiaries  is the subject
   of  any evaluation under any Environmental Requirement or any other federal,
   state  or local  investigation to  evaluate whether  any remedial  action is
   needed  to  respond  to  a  Release  of  Hazardous  Material  or  any  other
   environmental  matter,  other  than  investigations  that  are  unlikely  to
   materially  adversely affect  the business,  financial position,  results of
   operations or properties of the Borrower and its subsidiaries.

      Section 4.9. Regulation U.    The  Advances  will  not  be  used  by  the
   Borrower,  directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
   any margin stock or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any indebtedness
   that was  originally incurred to purchase  or carry margin stock  or for any
   other purpose that might  constitute the Advances a "purpose  credit" within
   the meaning of Regulation U or Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the
   Federal Reserve System.

  (viii) from  time to time such additional information regarding the business,
    financial position, results  of operations or properties of the Borrower as

    on all  of  the  properties  of  the Borrower  (to  be  delivered  no  more
    frequently than  twice during any calendar year) and a schedule of payments
    for all debt instruments of the Borrower).

      Section 6.2 Payment of  Obligations.  The  Borrower will, and  will cause
   each of its subsidiaries to, pay and discharge, as the same shall become due
   and payable, (i) all  its obligations and liabilities, including  all claims

   other like  persons which, in  any such case, if  unpaid, might by  law give
   rise to a Lien upon any of the Borrower's or any  such subsidiary's property
   or assets, and (ii) all lawful taxes, assessments and charges or levies made
   upon it  or its, or any such subsidiary or any such subsidiary's, properties
   or assets by any governmental body, agency or official (except  where any of
   the items  in clause (i)  or (ii) of  this Section  6.2 is being  diligently
   contested in  good faith and  the Borrower  has set aside  on its books,  if


                                       F-75

   required  under GAAP,  appropriate  reserves for  the  accrual of  any  such
   items).

      Section 6.3. Maintenance of Property; Insurance.  The  Borrower will, and
   will cause  each of  its subsidiaries  to, keep all  its properties  in good
   working order and  condition, subject  to ordinary wear  and tear,  maintain

   its properties in at least such amounts and against at least such risks (and
   with  such  risk retentions)  as are  usually  insured against  by companies
   engaged in  the same or  a similar  business and  furnish to  the Bank  upon
   request full information as to the insurance carried.

      Section 6.4. Conduct  of Business  and  Maintenance  of Existence.    The
   Borrower will continue to engage in business of the same general type as now
   conducted by  the Borrower and will  preserve, renew and keep  in full force
   and  effect its existence as a real  estate investment trust and its rights,
   privileges  and franchises necessary or  desirable in the  normal conduct of
   its business.

      Section 6.5. Compliance  with Laws.   The Borrower  will, and  will cause
   each of  its subsidiaries to, (i)  comply in all material  respects with all
   applicable  laws,  ordinances,  rules,   regulations,  and  requirements  of
   governmental authorities (including, without limitation, ERISA and the rules
   and regulations  thereunder and  all Environmental Requirements  (subject to
   Section 6.13)),  except  where  the necessity  of  compliance  therewith  is
   contested in  good faith by  appropriate proceedings  and (ii) at  all times
   cause to  be done those things necessary to maintain, preserve and renew its
   qualification as  a real  estate  investment trust  under the  Code and  all
   applicable regulations thereunder.

      Section 6.6. Accounting; Inspection of Property, Books and  Records.  The
   Borrower will  keep proper books of  record and account in  which full, true
   and correct  entries in conformity with  GAAP shall be made  of all dealings
   and transactions in relation  to its business and activities,  will maintain
   its   fiscal  reporting  periods  on  the  present  basis  and  will  permit
   representatives of the Bank, at the Borrower's expense (not to exceed $1,500
   in the  aggregate during any calendar year), to visit and inspect any of the

                                       F-76

   Borrower's  properties,  to  examine and  make  abstracts  from  any of  the
   Borrower's books and records and to discuss the Borrower's affairs, finances
   and accounts with the  Borrower's executive officers (who, on  the Effective
   Date,  are  those officers  identified  in Section  7.1(xi)  and independent
   public accountants,  all at such reasonable  times and as often  as the Bank
   may reasonably request.

   time be liable with respect to any  Debt except Debt which meets any one  of
   the following criteria:   (i) Debt outstanding under this Agreement  and the

      Section 6.8. Restrictions on  Liens.  The  Borrower will  not enter  into
   any  agreement,  or  permit  any  of  its  subsidiaries to  enter  into  any
   agreement, with any  third party which  would prohibit the  Borrower or  any
   such subsidiary  from creating a Lien on  any of its properties  in favor of
   the  Bank to  secure the  Borrower's obligations  to the Bank  hereunder and
   under the  Note.  The  Borrower will maintain  or cause its  subsidiaries to
   maintain  free  and clear  of  all  Liens  that  portion  of  its  and  such
   subsidiaries' real  property assets which  at all  times shall  have a  book
   value plus depreciation (each  as determined in accordance with  GAAP) equal
   to or  greater than the aggregate amount of the commitments of all banks now
   or hereafter  providing an  unsecured revolving  line of credit  ("Revolving
   Credit Banks")  to the  Borrower from  time to time.   The  Borrower further
   agrees that if at  any time it  creates a Lien in  favor of any  theretofore
   unsecured  Revolving Credit Bank, that it will  create such Lien in favor of
   all such Revolving  Credit Banks, including the Bank, on  a pari passu basis
   based on the commitments of such Revolving Credit Banks.

      Section 6.9. Consolidations, Mergers and  Sales of Assets.   The Borrower
   will not (i)  consolidate or  merge with or  into any other  Person or  (ii)
   sell, lease or otherwise transfer all or any substantial part  of its assets
   to  any other  Person; provided, however,  that the Borrower  may merge with
   another  real estate  investment trust  or company  if the  Borrower  is the


                                       F-77

   surviving entity  in such merger and  no Default shall have  occurred and be
   continuing immediately after giving effect to such merger.

      Section 6.10 Transactions  with   Affiliates.    The  Borrower  will  not
   directly  or indirectly  pay any funds  to or  to the  account of,  make any
   investment in,  engage in any transaction with  or effect any transaction in
   connection with any  joint enterprise  or other joint  arrangement with  any
   Affiliate  except in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  pursuant  to  the
   reasonable requirements  of the business of  the Borrower and upon  fair and
   reasonable terms no less favorable to the Borrower than would be obtained in
   a comparable arms-length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

      Section 6.11.  Transactions with  Other Persons.   The  Borrower will  not
   enter into any agreement  with any Person whereby any of them shall agree to
   any restriction  on  the Borrower's  right  to amend  or  waive any  of  the
   provisions of this Agreement.

      Section 6.12 ERISA Matters.   The Borrower will  not at  any time  permit
   any  Plan to  (i) engage in  any "prohibited  transaction" (as  such term is
   defined in section 4975 of  the Code or in Section 406 of ERISA), (ii) incur
   any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302
   of  ERISA), whether or not  waived, or (iii) be  terminated in a manner that
   could result  in the imposition  of a Lien  on the property of  the Borrower
   pursuant to Section 4068 of ERISA.  The Borrower will deliver or cause to be
   delivered to  the Bank if  and when any member  of the Controlled  Group (i)
   gives or is  required to give notice to  the PBGC of any  "reportable event"
   (as  defined in Section 4043 of ERISA)  with respect to any Plan which might
   constitute  grounds for a termination of such  Plan under Title IV of ERISA,
   or knows that the plan administrator of any Plan has given or is required to
   give notice  of any  such reportable  event, a  copy of  the notice  of such
   reportable event  given or required to  be given to the  PBGC, (ii) receives
   notice of complete or partial withdrawal liability  under Title IV of ERISA,
   a copy of such notice, or (iii) receives notice from the PBGC under Title IV
   of ERISA of an  intent to terminate or appoint  a trustee to administer  any
   Plan, a copy of such notice.

      Section 6.13 Environmental Matters.

                                       F-78

   will cause  each of its subsidiaries  to, (i) comply  with all Environmental
   Requirements, (ii) obtain,  maintain and comply with  all permits, licenses,
   registrations   and  authorizations   required   under   all   Environmental
   Requirements  and  (iii)  comply  with  all  court  orders, consent  orders,
   settlement  agreements or other  settlement documents issued  by, or entered
   into with, any  administrative or governmental  agency or entity  concerning
   compliance with all Environmental Requirements.

      (b)  The  Borrower shall  not be deemed  to be in  violation of subsection
   (a) above if (i) the Borrower,  its subsidiaries and/or its tenants or other
   potentially responsible  parties have initiated and  are diligently pursuing
   in  good  faith appropriate  measures satisfactory  to  the court  or agency
   having  jurisdiction over  the matter  to cure  or eliminate  the compliance
   failure,  (ii) there  has  been set  aside  on the  Borrower's  consolidated
   financial  statements a  reserve deemed  by the  Borrower in  its reasonable
   business judgment to be  sufficient to cover the noncompliance  liability or
   such greater amount as may be required by GAAP and (iii) such non-compliance
   will  not  materially adversely  affect  the  business, financial  position,
   results of operations or properties of the Borrower and its subsidiaries.

      Section 6.14 Pro-Rata Borrowing  and Repayment.   Borrower  will use  its
   best efforts  (i) to borrow  on an  aggregate basis over  the course of  any
   consecutive twelve month  period from all Revolving Credit  Banks, including
   the Bank, on an approximately pro-rata basis based on the commitments of the
   Revolving Credit  Banks and (ii) to  make any principal repayment  (which at
   any one  time  is equal  to  or greater  than  $10,000,000) of  the  amounts
   borrowed from the Revolving Credit Banks to all Revolving Credit Banks on an
   approximately pro-rata  basis based on the outstanding principal balances of
   the loans to the Borrower from the Revolving Credit Banks.

      Section 6.15 Confession of Judgment.   The  Borrower will  not grant  any
   other  Revolving Credit  Bank  the right  to  confess judgment  against  the
   Borrower.

   provide  working  capital  for  investment  activities,  for   construction,

                                       F-79

   renovation and tenant fit-up  for the shopping centers and  other properties
   acquired by the Borrower, for  debt reduction, for the payment  of dividends
   and  for  other similar  purposes  permissible  for real  estate  investment
   trusts.

      Section 6.17 Independence of Covenants.   All covenants contained  herein
   shall  be given independent effect.  If  a particular action or condition is
   not  permitted by  any  of such  covenants,  the fact  that  such action  or
   condition would  be permitted by an exception to, or otherwise be within the
   limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default
   if such action is taken or such condition exists.


                                    ARTICLE VII

                                     DEFAULTS

    6.14, 6.15 or 6.16 of this Agreement;

          (iii) the Borrower shall fail to observe or perform any covenant  or
    agreement contained in this Agreement (other  than those covered by clause
    (i)  or (ii)  above) for  10 Business  Days after  written notice  thereof
    shall  have been  given to  the Borrower by  the Bank;  provided, however,
    that the Borrower shall  be entitled to a  reasonable period of  time (not
    to  exceed  60 days  following  the  Borrower's  receipt  of such  written
    notice) to cure  such failure if (A)  the Bank reasonably  determines that
    such  failure cannot be remedied  within such 10 Business  Day period, (B)
    the  Borrower  initiates  action  to  cure  such  failure  within  such 10

                                       F-80

    Business Day  period, (C)  the Borrower  proceeds diligently  and in  good
    faith to cure such  failure and (D) the Bank determines that such  failure

          (iv)  any  representation, warranty, certification or statement made

    prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made;

       (v)  the Borrower shall fail to make any payment in respect of any Debt
    (other than the Note) owing  to the Bank  or any other recourse Debt  when
    due or within any applicable grace period;

          (vi)  any event  or  condition  shall  occur which  results  in  the
    acceleration of  the maturity  of any Debt  of the Borrower  owing to  the
    Bank or any other  recourse Debt of the Borrower  or enables the holder of
    such Debt or any  Person acting on such  holder's behalf to accelerate the
    maturity thereof;

         (vii)  the  Borrower  shall  commence   a  voluntary  case  or  other
    proceeding  seeking  liquidation,  reorganization  or  other  relief  with
    respect to itself or its debts under  any bankruptcy, insolvency or  other
    similar  law now or  hereafter in  effect or seeking the  appointment of a
    trustee, receiver, liquidator,  custodian or other similar official of  it
    or any substantial  part of its  property, or  shall consent  to any  such
    relief or to the  appointment of or taking possession by any such official
    in an involuntary case or other  proceeding commenced against it, or shall

                                       F-81

    trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian  or other similar  official of it
    or any substantial  part of  its property,  and such  involuntary case  or
    other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a  period of 30
    days, or an order  for relief shall be  entered against the Borrower under
    the federal bankruptcy laws as now or hereafter in effect;

          (ix)  one  or more judgments  or orders for the  payment of money in
    excess of $1,000,000 individually or $2,500,000  in the aggregate shall be
    rendered against  the Borrower and such  judgment or  order shall continue
    unsatisfied  for a period of  30 days during which execution thereof shall
    not be effectively stayed;

       (x)  the Internal Revenue Service shall make a final determination that
    the Borrower has  failed to maintain  its qualification as  a real  estate
    investment trust,  the Internal Revenue  Service shall  make a preliminary
    determination that Borrower has failed to  maintain its qualification as a

    contest or  remedy such  determination by  appropriate proceedings or  the
    stock of the Borrower shall cease to be publicly traded;

        (xii) the Bank  shall determine in good  faith that  a material adverse
    change has  occurred in the financial  condition of the Borrower  since the
    date of this Agreement,  and the Borrower shall fail to correct such change
    to  the satisfaction  of  the  Bank within  10  days  after written  notice
    thereof shall have been given to the Borrower by the Bank;

   then, and in every such event, the Bank may, at its option, by notice to the
   Borrower,  terminate  the Line  of Credit  Commitment  and declare  the Note
   (together  with accrued but unpaid  interest thereon) to  be immediately due
   and payable (and the Note shall thereupon become immediately due and payable
   without  presentment, demand,  protest or other  notice of any  kind, all of
   which  are hereby waived by the Borrower);  provided, however, that upon the
   occurrence of  any of  the Events  of Default  specified in  clause (vii) or

                                       F-82

   Bank, the Line of Credit  Commitment shall terminate and the  Note (together
   with accrued but unpaid  interest thereon) shall immediately become  due and
   payable  without presentment, demand, protest  or other notice  of any kind,
   all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

   and be  continuing, the Bank may  proceed to protect and  enforce its rights
   under  this Agreement  and  the  Note by  exercising  such  remedies as  are
   available to the  Bank in respect  thereof under  applicable law, either  by
   suit in equity or by action at law or both, for  specific performance of any
   covenant  or other agreement  contained in this  Agreement or in  aid of the
   exercise of any power granted in this Agreement.  No failure or delay by the
   Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under the Note
   shall operate as a waiver  thereof nor shall any single or  partial exercise
   thereof  preclude any other  or further exercise thereof  or the exercise of
   any  other  right, power  or  privilege.   The  rights  and remedies  herein
   provided shall  be cumulative and  not exclusive of  any rights or  remedies
   provided by law.

      Section 7.3. Inspection  of Properties.   The  Bank,  upon obtaining  any
   judgment  against the Borrower, shall have the  right to enter upon, and the
   Borrower  hereby specifically grants to  the Bank a  license (effective only
   upon  the  entry  of  a  judgment) to  enter  upon,  any  of  the Borrower's
   properties that  the  Bank  may  seek  to acquire  in  connection  with  the
   enforcement  of such  judgment for  the purpose  of inspecting,  testing and
   assessing  the  properties for  the presence  of  Hazardous Materials.   The
   Borrower shall reimburse the Bank upon demand for all costs  and expenses of
   any and  all inspections, testing and  assessing.  If the  Borrower fails to
   reimburse the Bank upon demand for such  costs, then the Bank may pursue all
   its legal remedies to recover such costs.


                                   ARTICLE VIII

                              CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
                       AFFECTING EURO-DOLLAR-BASED ADVANCES

                                       F-83

      Section 8.1. Basis for  Determining  Adjusted  London  Interbank  Offered
   Rate Inadequate or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of  any Interest
   Period:

       (i)  the Bank  is advised that  deposits in dollars  (in the  applicable
    amounts)  are not being  offered in  the relevant market  for such Interest
    Period; or

          (ii)  the Bank determines  that the Adjusted London Interbank  Offered
    Rate  will not  adequately  and  fairly reflect  the  cost to  the  Bank of
    maintaining or  funding the  Euro-Dollar-Based Advances  for such  Interest
    Period  (and such  determination  is  also  made  with respect  to  all  or
    substantially all  other borrowers from  the Bank  that pay  interest at  a
    rate based on the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate);

   then the Bank shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower, whereupon,
   until such circumstances no longer exist, the right of the Borrower to elect
   to  have the Advances bear  interest at the  Euro-Dollar-Based Rate shall be
   suspended and the 
   Euro-Dollar-Based Advances then outstanding  shall begin bearing interest at
   the Prime-Based Rate at the end of the Interest Period(s) applicable to such
   Euro-Dollar-Based Advances.

      Section 8.2. Illegality.   If, after  the  date  of this  Agreement,  the
   adoption  of any applicable law, rule or  regulation, or any change therein,
   or  any  change  in the  interpretation  or  administration  thereof by  any
   governmental authority, central bank or  comparable agency charged with  any
   interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank with any
   request  or directive (whether or  not having the force of  law) of any such
   authority,  central  bank or  comparable agency  shall  make it  unlawful or
   impossible  for the  Bank to  make, maintain  or fund  the Euro-Dollar-Based
   Advances,  the  Bank shall  promptly give  notice  thereof to  the Borrower.
   Before  giving any notice to the  Borrower pursuant to this Section 8.2, the
   Bank shall designate  a different  lending office if  such designation  will
   avoid  the need  for giving  such  notice and  will not,  in the  reasonable
   judgment  of the Bank,  be otherwise disadvantageous  to the Bank.   If such
   notice is given, the Euro-Dollar-Based Advances then outstanding shall begin

                                       F-84

   bearing  interest at the Prime-Based Rate either  (i) on the last day of the
   applicable Interest Period if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain and
   fund   such  Advances  at  the   Euro-Dollar-Based  Rate  to   such  day  or
   (ii) immediately if the Bank may not  lawfully continue to maintain and fund
   such Advances at  the Euro-Dollar-Based Rate to such day  (in which case the
   Borrower  shall  reimburse the  Bank  on demand  for  any resulting  loss or
   reasonable expense in accordance with Section 2.11).

      Section 8.3. Increased Cost and Reduced Return.

      (a)  If, after the  date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable
   law, rule  or  regulation, or  any  change therein,  or  any change  in  the
   interpretation  or  administration  thereof by  any  governmental authority,
   central  bank  or  comparable  agency  charged  with  any interpretation  or
   administration  thereof, or  compliance  by the  Bank  with any  request  or
   directive (whether  or not having the  force of law) of  any such authority,
   central bank or comparable agency:

       (i)  shall  subject the  Bank  to any  tax,  duty or  other charge  with
    respect to the  Euro-Dollar-Based Advances or the Bank's obligation to make
    the Euro-Dollar-Based  Advances, or shall change  the basis  of taxation of
    payments to the Bank of the principal of or interest on the 
    Euro-Dollar-Based Advances or  any other  amounts due under  this Agreement
    or the Note in respect of the 
    Euro-Dollar-Based  Advances  or the  Bank's obligation  to  make  the Euro-
    Dollar-Based  Advances (except  for  changes  in the  rate  of tax  on  the
    overall  net income of  the Bank imposed by  the jurisdiction  in which the
    Bank's principal executive office is located); or

          (ii)  shall impose,  modify or  deem applicable  any reserve,  special
    deposit or  similar requirement  (including, without  limitation, any  such
    requirement imposed  by  the Board  of  Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve
    System, but  excluding any  such  requirement  included in  the  applicable
    Euro-Dollar Reserve  Percentage) against  assets of, deposits  with or  for
    the account of, or  credit extended by,  the Bank, or shall  impose on  the
    Bank or on the London interbank   market any other condition affecting  the
    Euro-Dollar-Based Advances or the Bank's obligation to make the 

                                       F-85

    Euro-Dollar-Based Advances;

   and the result of any of the foregoing  is to increase the cost to the  Bank
   of  making or maintaining the  Euro-Dollar-Based Advances, or  to reduce the
   amount of any sum received or receivable by the Bank under this Agreement or
   under the Note, then the Borrower  shall pay to the Bank in accordance  with
   subsection (c) below such  additional amount or  amounts as will  compensate
   the Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

      (b)  If  the  Bank  shall   determine  that  any   applicable  law,  rule,
   regulation or guideline or the adoption  after the date of this Agreement of
   any  law, rule, regulation or  guideline regarding capital  adequacy, or any
   change in any of the foregoing or in the interpretation or administration of
   any  of the  foregoing  by  any  governmental  authority,  central  bank  or
   comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof,
   or  compliance by the  Bank with any request  or directive regarding capital
   adequacy (whether  or not having  the force of  law) of any  such authority,
   central bank  or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing
   the  rate of  return on  the Bank's  capital or  the  capital of  any Person
   controlling the Bank  as a consequence of the Bank's  obligations under this
   Agreement to  a level below that  which the Bank or  such controlling Person
   could have achieved but for such law, adoption, change or compliance (taking
   into  consideration the Bank's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by
   an amount  deemed by the  Bank to  be material, then  from time to  time the
   Borrower shall pay to  the Bank in accordance with subsection (c) below such
   additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such reduction.

      (c)  The Bank  will promptly notify the Bank  of any event of which it has
   knowledge,  occurring after the date  of this Agreement,  which will entitle
   the Bank to  compensation pursuant to this  Section 8.3 and will  deliver to
   the  Borrower with  each  demand for  payment a  certificate,  signed by  an
   officer of  the Bank, setting forth the  amount or amounts to  be paid to it
   hereunder, explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount or
   amounts and setting forth in reasonable detail the method by  which the Bank
   allocated any such amount or amounts  to the Borrower.  Any such certificate
   shall be conclusive in the  absence of manifest error.  In  determining such
   amount,  the Bank may use  any reasonable averaging  and attribution methods

                                       F-86

   generally used by the  Bank for the  purpose of calculating increased  costs
   and  reduced returns and allocating  increased costs and  reduced returns to
   borrowers.   The  Bank will  designate a  different lending  office  if such
   designation  will  avoid  the  need  for, or  reduce  the  amount  of,  such
   compensation and  will  not, in  the  reasonable judgment  of the  Bank,  be
   otherwise disadvantageous to it.

      (d)  All payments  required  by this  Section 8.3  shall  be made  by  the
   Borrower within 30  days after demand by  the Bank.   All such payments  not
   made  on  or before  the  tenth  Business Day  after  such  demand shall  be
   accompanied  by interest thereon for each  day from and including such tenth
   Business Day to but excluding payment in full thereof at a rate equal to the
   Prime Rate minus  1.00% per annum.  The  Borrower shall not be  obligated to
   reimburse the Bank for  any increased cost or  reduced return incurred  more
   than  90 days after  the date that  the Bank receives actual  notice of such
   increased cost or reduced return unless the Bank gives notice thereof to the
   Borrower in accordance with this Section 8.3 during such 90 day period.

      Section 8.4. Suspension of Advances.   If notice has  been given pursuant
   to Section 8.2 requiring that  the Euro-Dollar-Based Advances cease to  bear
   interest  at the  Euro-Dollar-Based Rate,  then, unless  and until  the Bank
   notifies  the Borrower that the circumstances  giving rise to such notice no
   longer apply or that the Bank has elected to continue such Euro-Dollar-Based
   Advances  at  the Euro-Dollar-Based  Rate through  the  end of  the Interest
   Period(s)  applicable to  such Euro-Dollar-Based Advances,  the Euro-Dollar-
   Based Advances then outstanding  shall begin bearing interest at  the Prime-
   Based Rate from and including  the date of such notice (notwithstanding  any
   prior election by the Borrower to the contrary).

      Section 9.2. No  Waivers.  No failure or delay  by the Bank in exercising
   any   right,  power  or  privilege   hereunder  (except  as   set  forth  in
   Section 8.3(d)) or under  the Note shall  operate as  a waiver thereof,  nor
   shall  any single or partial exercise  thereof preclude any other or further
   exercise  thereof or the  exercise of any  other right, power  or privilege.
   The  rights and  remedies  herein  provided  shall  be  cumulative  and  not
   exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

      Section 9.3. Expenses.   The  Borrower  shall pay  (i) all  out-of-pocket
   expenses of the Bank, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of its
   counsel, in connection with the preparation of this Agreement, any waiver or

   an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Bank,
   including  the  reasonable  fees  and   disbursements  of  its  counsel,  in
   connection   with  such  Event  of  Default  and  any  collection  or  other
   enforcement proceedings  resulting therefrom.  The  Borrower shall indemnify
   the Bank  against  any transfer  taxes,  documentary taxes,  assessments  or
   charges made by any  governmental authority by reason  of the execution  and
   delivery of this Agreement or the Note.

      Section 9.4. Indemnification.    In  consideration of  the  execution and

   harmless from and  against any  and all  actions, causes  of action,  suits,
   losses,   costs,  liabilities,   obligations,  penalties,   fines,  demands,
   defenses,  damages,  disbursements   or  expenses  of  any  kind  or  nature
   whatsoever  (including  attorneys' fees  and  costs  and experts'  fees  and
   disbursements and  expenses incurred  in investigating,  settling, defending
   against or prosecuting any litigation, claim or proceeding) which may at any

                                       F-88

   time  be  imposed  upon, incurred  by  or asserted  or  awarded  against any
   Indemnified Party (irrespective of  whether any such Indemnified Party  is a
   party to the action  of which indemnification hereunder is  sought), whether
   incurred in connection  with actions between or among the  parties hereto or
   the  parties  hereto  and  third  parties  (collectively,  the  "Indemnified
   Liabilities"), incurred  by the  Indemnified  Parties or  any of  them as  a
   result of, or arising out of, or relating to:

      (i)  the actual  or alleged  presence of  any Hazardous  Material on,  in,
    under or  affecting, the  transportation of  any Hazardous  Material to  or
    from, or the Release of any Hazardous Material  from or in connection with,
    all  or any  portion  of any  property, owned,  leased  or operated  by the
    Borrower or  any of its subsidiaries,  the ground water  or any surrounding
    areas  (provided  that  there  is  a   nexus  to  the  Borrower's  or  such
    subsidiary's property);

     (ii)  any  misrepresentation,   inaccuracy  or  breach   of  any   warranty
    contained in or referred to in Section 4.7;

    (iii)  the  failure  of  the  Borrower  to  comply  with  any  Environmental
    Requirement during or after the term of this Agreement;

     (iv)  the imposition of any  Lien for damages caused by or the recovery  of
    any costs  for the  clean-up, Release  or threatened  Release of  Hazardous
    Material  by the  Borrower, or  in connection  with any  property  owned or
    formerly owned by the Borrower; or

      (v)  any  actual  or  alleged  prohibited  transaction  or  any actual  or
    alleged sale of  a prohibited loan under  ERISA or under any  state statute
    regulating  investments of,  and  fiduciary  obligations with  respect  to,
    governmental plans relating  to Section 3(32)  of ERISA,  and in  obtaining
    any  individual  prohibited  transaction  exemption  under   ERISA  or  any
    administrative exemption under any state  statute that may be  required (in
    the Bank's sole  discretion) that the Bank or  any of the Bank's affiliates
    or Indemnified  Parties may incur, directly  or indirectly, as  a result of
    any misrepresentation,  inaccuracy or  breach of any  warranty contained in
    or referred to in Section 4.7.

                                       F-89

   The  obligations of the Borrower in respect of Indemnified Liabilities shall
   survive repayment of the Note or  any transfer of the Borrower's property by
   foreclosure  or by  a deed  in lieu  of foreclosure,  regardless  of whether
   caused by or within the control of the Borrower.  Notwithstanding any of the
   foregoing, the Borrower shall  not be responsible, or otherwise  liable for,
   any  Indemnified  Liabilities  arising  for  the  account  of  a  particular
   Indemnified Party  by  reason  of the  relevant  Indemnified  Party's  gross
   negligence or wilful misconduct or breach  of this Agreement.  The  Borrower
   and its successors and assigns  hereby waive, release and agree not  to make
   any claim  or bring any  cause or  recovery action against  the Bank or  any
   other  Indemnified  Party in  respect of  claims  arising under  clauses (i)
   through (v) above.  It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent
   that any such  Person is strictly liable in  respect of any such  claim, the
   Borrower's  obligations to such Person under this Section 9.4 shall likewise
   be without regard  to fault on the part of the  Borrower with respect to the
   violation or condition which results in liability of such Person.  If and to
   the  extent  that the  foregoing undertaking  may  be unenforceable  for any
   reason, the Borrower hereby  agrees to make the maximum  contribution to the
   payment and satisfaction  of each  of the Indemnified  Liabilities which  is
   permissible under applicable law.

      Section 9.5. Right  of  Set-Off.   Upon  the  occurrence  and during  the
   continuance of  any Event of Default,  the Bank is hereby  authorized at any
   time and from time  to time, to the fullest extent permitted  by law, to set
   off  and apply  any and all  deposits (general  or special,  time or demand,
   provisional or  final) at any time  held and other indebtedness  at any time
   owing  by the  Bank to  or for  the credit  or the  account of  the Borrower
   against any and all of the obligations now or hereafter  existing under this
   Agreement or  the Note, irrespective of  whether or not the  Bank shall have
   made any demand hereunder or under the Note and although such obligation may
   be unmatured.  The rights of the Bank under this Section 9.5 are in addition
   to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
   set-off) which the Bank  may have.  The  Bank agrees to notify  the Borrower
   promptly after it exercises any such right of set-off.




                                       F-90

      Section 9.6. Amendments  and Waivers.  Any provision of this Agreement or
   the Note may  be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver
   is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Bank.

      Section 9.7. Successors and Assigns.  

      (a)  The provisions of this Agreement shall  be binding upon and  inure to
   the  benefit of  the  parties hereto  and  their respective  successors  and
   assigns, except that  the Borrower may not assign or  otherwise transfer any
   of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written  consent of the
   Bank.

      (b)  The Bank may at any time grant to one or more affiliates  of the Bank
   (each, a  "Participant")  participating  interests  in the  Line  of  Credit
   Commitment or in any or all of the Advances.  In the event of any such grant
   by the Bank  of a participating  interest to a  Participant, whether or  not
   upon notice  to the  Borrower,  the Bank  shall remain  responsible for  the
   performance of its  obligations hereunder,  and the Bank  shall continue  to
   deal solely  and directly  with the Borrower  in connection with  the Bank's
   rights  and obligations  under this  Agreement.   Any agreement  pursuant to
   which the Bank  may grant such a  participating interest shall provide  that
   the  Bank shall  retain  the sole  right and  responsibility to  enforce the
   obligations  of  the  Borrower   under  this  Agreement  including,  without
   limitation,  the right to approve  any amendment, modification  or waiver of
   any provision of this Agreement or the Note.

      (c)  The Bank  may at  any  time assign  to one  or  more  banks or  other
   institutions (each, an "Assignee") all or part of its rights and obligations
   under this  Agreement and  the Note,  and  such Assignee  shall assume  such
   rights  and obligations, pursuant to an instrument executed by such Assignee
   and the Bank with (and subject to) the consent of the Borrower (which may be
   withheld in  the Borrower's sole  discretion); provided,  however, that  any
   partial assignment shall be in  the amount of at least $500,000  or integral
   multiples thereof.  Upon  execution and delivery  of such an instrument  and
   payment by  such Assignee to  the Bank of  an amount  equal to the  purchase
   price agreed between such  Assignee and the Bank, such Assignee shall become
   a party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a

                                       F-91

   bank with  a Line of Credit  Commitment as set  forth in such  instrument of
   assumption, and the Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to
   a corresponding  extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall
   be  required.   Upon the  consummation of  any assignment  pursuant to  this
   Section  9.7(c),   the  Bank  and   the  Borrower  shall   make  appropriate
   arrangements so  that, if required, a  new Note is issued  to such Assignee.
   The cost of the preparation of such new Note shall be borne by the Bank.  In
   the  event that  such Assignee  is not  incorporated under  the laws  of the
   United States of America  or any jurisdiction thereof, such  Assignee shall,
   prior to the first date on which interest or fees  are payable hereunder for
   its  account  deliver to  the Borrower  certification  as to  exemption from
   deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes.

      (d)  The Bank may furnish any information  concerning the Borrower in  its
   possession  from  time to  time  to  Participants  and Assignees  (including
   prospective  Participants and  Assignees) and  may, with  the  prior written
   consent  of the  Borrower, furnish  such information  in response  to credit
   inquiries consistent with general banking practice.

      (e)  No  Participant, Assignee or  other transferee  of the  Bank's rights
   shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.3 than such
   transferee would  have been entitled  to receive with respect  to the rights
   assigned or  otherwise transferred, unless  such assignment  or transfer  is
   made  with the  Borrower's  prior  written  consent  or  by  reason  of  the
   provisions of Section 8.2 or 8.3 requiring the Bank to designate a different
   lending  office  under  certain   circumstances  or  at  a  time   when  the
   circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

      Section 9.8. Governing Law.   This Agreement and the Note shall be deemed
   to be contracts  made under seal and  shall be governed by  and construed in
   accordance  with the  laws of  the Commonwealth  of Pennsylvania,  except as
   otherwise provided herein.

      Section 9.9. Counterparts; Effectiveness.  This  Agreement may be  signed
   in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
   if the  signatures thereto and hereto  were upon the same  instrument.  This


                                       F-92

   Agreement  shall  become  effective  when  the  Bank  shall  have   received
   counterparts hereof signed by both parties.

      Section 9.10.  Waiver  of Jury  Trial; Submission  to Jurisdiction.    The
   Borrower and the Bank hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive all right
   to trial by jury in  any action, proceeding, or counterclaim arising  out of
   or  related  to this  Agreement  or the  Notes  or any  of  the transactions
   contemplated hereby or thereby.  Any legal action or proceeding with respect
   to  this Agreement or  the Notes or  any document related  hereto or thereto
   shall be brought  in a federal court  or Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  state
   court sitting in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, and by execution and  delivery
   of this Agreement the Borrower and the Bank hereby accept for themselves and
   in   respect  of   their  property,   generally  and   unconditionally,  the
   jurisdiction of  the aforesaid  courts.   The Borrower  and the Bank  hereby
   irrevocably  and unconditionally  waive  any  objection, including,  without
   limitation,  any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of
   the  forum non  conveniens  which they  now  or hereafter  may  have to  the
   bringing of any action or proceeding in such respective jurisdictions.

      Section 9.11.  Waiver  of  Personal  Liability.     The  Borrower's  Third
   Amended  and Restated  Declaration of  Trust on  file in  the Office  of the
   Recorder of  Deeds of the  District of  Columbia provides  that neither  the
   shareholders  nor the trustees of  the Borrower, nor  any officer, employee,
   representative or  agent of the Borrower, shall be personally liable for the
   satisfaction of the obligations  of the Borrower under this Agreement or the
   Note.   The  Bank hereby  agrees  to look  solely to  the  Borrower and  the
   property of the Borrower for the satisfaction of any claim arising from this
   Agreement,   and  shall  not  seek  to  impose  personal  liability  on  any
   shareholder,  trustee, officer,  employee,  representative or  agent of  the
   Borrower in connection with  any such claim.  As used  in this Section 9.11,
   the  term  "trustee" shall  mean,  collectively,  the individuals  currently
   serving as trustees of the Borrower, as long as they continue in office, and
   all other individuals then in office who have been duly elected or appointed
   as trustees of the Borrower.

      Section 9.12.  Entire Agreement.   This  Agreement and the Note  set forth
   the  entire agreement  of the  parties with  respect to  the subject  matter

                                       F-93

   hereof and therefor  and supersede all  previous understandings, written  or
   oral, in respect thereof.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have  caused this Agreement  to be
   duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year
   first above written.
