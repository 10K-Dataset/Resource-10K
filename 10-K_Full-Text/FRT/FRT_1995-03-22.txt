     PART I & II
     -----------
     Item 1.  Business
     ------  --------
              Federal Realty Investment Trust is an owner, operator and
     redeveloper of community and neighborhood shopping centers.  The Trust is
     a self-administered real estate investment trust, founded in 1962, that
     manages, leases and supervises renovation of its properties. The Trust
     consolidates the financial statements of one wholly owned subsidiary, nine
     partnerships, and a joint venture.  At December 31, 1994 the Trust owned
     53 retail properties, primarily community and neighborhood centers, and
     one apartment complex.  The Trust's properties are located primarily on
     the east coast  between the New York metropolitan area and Richmond,
     Virginia.  

              The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify
     as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the
     Internal Revenue Code.  Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at
     least 95% of its real estate investment trust taxable income to its
     shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not
     be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
     shareholders.  The Trust intends to continue to qualify and to distribute
     substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.  Therefore,
     no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

              An important part of the Trust's strategy is to acquire older,
     well-located centers and to enhance their operating performance through a
     program of renovation, expansion, re-configuration, re-leasing and re-
     merchandising.  The Trust has focused primarily on community and
     neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by supermarkets, drug
     stores or high volume, value oriented retailers that provide consumer
     necessities.  The Trust's shopping center leases typically are structured
     to include minimum rents and percentage rents based on tenants' sales
     volumes and reimbursement of operating and real estate tax expenses.










              The Trust's real estate portfolio has increased from 43
     properties as of January 1990 to 54 properties as of December 31, 1994. 
     During this five year period the Trust acquired 13 shopping centers and
     one retail building, containing approximately 2.5 million square feet, at
     a cost of $191.5 million and sold three shopping centers containing
     460,000 square feet.  Three of these acquisitions were in the Chicago,
     Illinois area and two were in the Boston, Massachusetts area, both of
     which are new markets for the Trust.  During this same period the Trust
     spent over $150 million to renovate, expand and improve its properties. 
     One of the  shopping centers acquired during the last five years was
     acquired by means of capital and ground leases, while the remainder were
     acquired primarily with cash.  This growth was financed  through borrowing
     and equity offerings, since each year the Trust has distributed all or the
     majority of its cash provided by operating activities to its shareholders.

              At December 31, 1994, the Trust's 53 retail properties contain
     approximately 11.2 million net rentable square feet,  with approximately
     1,500 tenants who provide a wide range of retail products and services. 
     These tenants range from sole proprietorships to national retailers. 
     Fifteen of the shopping centers are located in the Maryland and Virginia
     suburbs of Washington, D.C., eleven are in Pennsylvania, nine are in New
     Jersey, three are in Virginia, two are in the Baltimore, Maryland suburbs,
     four are in Illinois, two are in Massachusetts, and there is one in each
     of the following, North Carolina, Michigan, Georgia, New York,  Tennessee,
     and  Louisiana.  In addition, the Trust owns one retail building in
     Westport, Connecticut and one 282 unit apartment development located in
     Silver Spring, Maryland.  No single property or tenant accounted for more
     than 10% or 5%, respectively, of the Trust's revenues.

              An important part of the Trust's investment strategy has been and
     will continue to be to acquire older, well-located shopping centers in its
     core major metropolitan markets of New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia and
     Baltimore/Washington, D.C. as well as its newer Chicago and Boston markets
     and to enhance their revenue potential through a program of renovation,
     re-leasing and re-merchandising.  In addition the Trust is planning to
     acquire retail buildings in densely developed urban and suburban areas
     (main street retail), in order to capitalize on the demand by retailers
     for space in these areas.  In December 1994 the Trust formed Street
     Retail, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary organized as a Maryland
     corporation, to own and operate these types of properties.  The Trust is
     also looking for sites in its core markets, which are suitable for the
     development of new shopping centers.  During the years ended December 31,
     1994, 1993, and 1992, shopping centers have contributed 95%, 94% and 92%,
     respectively, of the Trust's total revenue.

              The Trust is currently limited to investing east of the
     Mississippi River; to change this limitation requires Trustee approval. 
     Investments are not required to be based on specific allocation by type of
     property.  The extent to which the Trust may mortgage or otherwise finance
     investments varies with the investment involved and the economic climate.










              The success of the Trust depends upon, among other factors, the
     trends of the economy,including interest rates, construction costs,
     retailing trends, income tax laws, increases or decreases in operating
     expenses and, governmental regulations, population trends, zoning laws,
     legislation and the ability of the Trust to keep its properties leased at
     profitable levels.  The Trust competes for tenants with other real estate
     owners and the Trust's properties account for only a small fraction of the
     shopping centers available for lease.  The Trust competes for investment
     opportunities and mortgage financing with individuals, partnerships,
     corporations, financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension
     funds and trust funds.  The Trust regularly reviews its portfolio and from
     time to time considers the sale of certain of its properties.

              Investments in real property create a potential for environmental
     liability on the part of the current and previous owners of, or any
     mortgage lender on, such real property.  If hazardous substances are
     discovered on or emanating from any properties, the owner or operator of
     the property may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to such
     hazardous substances.  The Trust's current policy is to obtain an
     environmental study on each property it seeks to acquire.  On recent
     acquisitions, any substances identified prior to closing which present an
     immediate environmental hazard have been or are in the process of
     remediation.  Costs related to the abatement of asbestos which increase
     the value of Trust properties are capitalized.  Other costs are expensed. 
     In 1994 approximately $1.4 million, of which $1.0 million was capitalized
     abatement costs, was spent on environmental matters.  The Trust has
     budgeted approximately $1.5 million for 1995 for environmental matters, a
     majority of which is projected for asbestos abatement.  (See Note 6 of
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)


     Current Developments
     --------------------
              During 1994, the Trust purchased four shopping centers totaling
     469,000 square feet.  The shopping centers are Idylwood Plaza in Falls
     Church, Virginia, North Lake Commons in Lake Zurich, Illinois, Garden
     Market Shopping Center in Western Springs, Illinois and Queen Anne Plaza
     in Norwell, Massachusetts.  In addition, in April 1994 the Trust purchased
     a 3.9 acre parcel of land, underlying  an Acme supermarket, which adjoins
     its Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.  In December
     1994 the Trust purchased a 16,000 square foot retail building in Westport,
     Connecticut.  These properties were acquired for a total price of $49.4
     million.

              In February 1995, the Trust purchased a 6,800 square foot retail
     building in downtown Greenwich, Connecticut for $2.0 million.  This is the
     Trust's second main street retail property.

              The Trust continued its strategy of renovating, expanding and
     reconfiguring its centers in 1994, spending approximately $42.3 million. 
     These improvements included $15.5 million on the renovation and expansion
     of Congressional Plaza in Rockville, Maryland, $4.1 million to complete








     the redevelopment of Ellisburg Circle Shopping Center in Cherry Hill, New
     Jersey, and $3.9 million to begin the redevelopment and retenanting of
     Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center in Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

              The Trust funded its 1994 acquisition, redevelopment projects and
     major debt repayment requirements through a variety of equity and debt
     issues.  In April 1994 the Trust raised net proceeds of $61.3 million from
     a public offering of 2.5 million shares.  In a concurrent offering of
     840,000 shares to an institutional investor, the Trust raised net proceeds
     of $21.7 million.  In January 1994 the Trust placed a $22.5 million one
     year mortgage on Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia.

              In October 1994, the Trust modified its unsecured medium-term
     revolving credit facilities with four banks, increasing the Trust's access
     to funds from $85.0 million to $130.0 million.  The Trust had $54.7
     million drawn under these facilities at December 31, 1994.  The facilities
     have covenants requiring a minimum shareholders' equity and a maximum
     ratio of debt to net worth.

              In April 1994, $39.8 million of the Trust's 5 1/4% convertible
     subordinated debentures due 2002 were redeemed at a price equal to 120% of
     their principal amount or $47.8 million.

              In January 1995 the Trust issued $100.0 million of 8 7/8% Senior
     Notes.  The senior notes, which pay interest semi-annually on January 15
     and July 15, mature January 15, 2000.  Proceeds from this borrowing were
     used to repay amounts drawn on the Trust's revolving credit facilities and
     to repay the $22.5 million mortgage on Northeast Plaza.

              At December 31, 1994 the Trust had 204 full-time employees.

     Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
     Results of Operations

     Liquidity and Capital Resources
     -------------------------------
              Federal Realty meets its liquidity requirements through net cash
     provided by operating activities, long term borrowing through debt
     offerings and mortgages, medium and short term borrowing under revolving
     credit facilities, and equity offerings. Because all or a significant
     portion of the Trust's net cash provided by operating activities is
     distributed to shareholders, capital outlays for property acquisitions,
     renovation projects and debt repayments require funding from borrowing or
     equity offerings. 

              During the period 1992 through 1994 the Trust acquired twelve
     shopping centers, one retail building, the land underlying one of its
     existing shopping centers and a parcel of land adjoining another of its
     centers. In addition, several centers underwent major renovation while
     general improvements and tenant work were done at many of the others.

              During 1994 the Trust purchased four shopping centers and one
     retail building, Idylwood Plaza in Falls Church, Virginia, North Lake
     Commons in Lake Zurich, Illinois, Garden Market Shopping Center in Western
     Springs, Illinois, Queen Anne Plaza in Norwell, Massachusetts and the
     Ship's Building in Westport, Connecticut. In addition, the Trust purchased
     a 3.9 acre parcel of land, on which there is an Acme supermarket, which
     adjoins its Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center. These properties were acquired
     for a total cash investment of $49.4 million.  

              During 1994, $42.3 million was expended on improvements to Trust
     properties.  These improvements included $15.5 million on the renovation
     and expansion of Congressional Plaza in Rockville, Maryland, $4.1 million
     to complete the redevelopment of Ellisburg Circle Shopping Center in
     Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and $3.9 million to begin the redevelopment and
     retenanting of Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center in Gaithersburg,
     Maryland.

              In 1993 the Trust spent $101.8 million to acquire six shopping
     centers (Gaithersburg Square and Quince Orchard Shopping Centers in
     Gaithersburg, Maryland, Pan Am Shopping Center in Fairfax, Virginia,
     Crossroads Shopping Center in Highland Park, Illinois, Bala Cynwyd
     Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Dedham Plaza
     in Dedham, Massachusetts), $6.2 million in connection with the long term
     lease of Bethesda Row in Bethesda, Maryland, and $34.3 million in
     improvements to its properties.  In 1992 the Trust acquired the Ellisburg
     Circle Shopping Center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey for $15.3 million and
     the land underlying Wildwood Shopping Center, which had been subject to a
     ground lease, for $9.1 million.  Improvements to Trust properties totalled
     $15.2 million in 1992.

              These acquisitions and improvements, as well as  debt repayment
     requirements, were funded through a variety of equity and debt issues.  In








     April 1994 the Trust raised net proceeds of $61.3 million from a public
     offering of 2.5 million common shares of beneficial interest ("shares"). 
     In a concurrent offering of 840,000 shares to an institutional investor,
     the Trust raised net proceeds of $21.7 million.  In April 1993, 2.8
     million shares were issued in a public offering, netting proceeds of $72.8
     million.  In December 1993 another 220,000 shares were issued for $5.4
     million in a private placement in connection with the long term lease of
     Bethesda Row.  In June 1992, 3.4 million shares were sold in a public
     offfering, raising net proceeds of $66.5 million.

              In March 1992 the Trust exchanged $22.6 million principal amount
     of its 5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 for 1.3 million
     shares.  Another $21.2 million principal amount of these debentures was
     retired in 1992 when they were repurchased by the Trust.  The Trust
     purchased an additional $3.7 million of these debentures in 1993 and in
     April 1994, $39.8 million of the debentures were redeemed at a price equal
     to 120% of their principal amount or $47.8 million.  

              The Trust called its 8 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures
     and its 8.65% Senior Notes for redemption in 1993.  The Trust redeemed
     $173,000 principal amount of the 8 3/4% debentures at a price of $1017.50
     per debenture on March 15; the balance of the debentures that had been
     outstanding or $2.2 million were converted into shares.  The senior notes
     were redeemed on May 14, at a price of $1010 for a total redemption price
     of $50.5 million.

              In October 1993 the Trust issued  $75.0 million of 5 1/4%
     convertible subordinated debentures, realizing cash proceeds of
     approximately $73.0 million.  The debentures, which mature in 2003, are
     convertible into shares at $36 per share.

          In 1992 the Trust placed a $30.0 million mortgage, initially bearing
     interest at 8 1/4%, on Federal Plaza.  In November 1994 the Trust spent
     $4.2 million to exercise the option to purchase the land at Northeast
     Shopping Center, $3.4 million of which had been recorded as a capital
     lease obligation.  During 1992 and 1993, respectively, $6.3 million and
     $34.9 million of mortgage obligations were prepaid.  In January 1994 a
     $22.5 million one year mortgage was placed on Northeast Plaza in Atlanta,
     Georgia.  The mortgage was repaid in January 1995.

              At December 31, 1994 the Trust had $130 million of unsecured
     medium term revolving credit facilities with four banks.  The facilities
     require fees and have covenants requiring a minimum shareholders' equity
     and a maximum ratio of debt to net worth.  The Trust uses these facilities
     to fund acquisitions and other cash requirements until conditions are
     favorable for issuing equity or long term debt.  At December 31, 1994
     there was $54.7 million drawn under these facilities, which was the
     maximum drawn during 1994.  Borrowings under these facilities bear
     interest at LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 85 to 100 basis
     points;  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings during 1994 was
     5.6%.  









              At December 1993 the Trust had $70.0 million of unsecured medium
     term revolving credit facilities with three banks.  The maximum drawn
     under these facilities in 1993 was $64.1 million and at December 31, 1993,
     there was $24.4 million outstanding.  The weighted average interest rate
     on borrowing during 1993 was 4.2%.  At December 31, 1992 the Trust had a
     $20.0 million unsecured line of credit available.  Interest on borrowings
     in 1995 are expected to be higher than in 1994 and 1993 as interest rates
     have risen. 

              The Trust has budgeted $47.0 million for capital improvements to
     its properties in 1995.  These improvements include: (1) $14.5  million to
     complete the renovation and expansion of Congressional Plaza; (2) $5.0
     million to renovate Brick Plaza, which was deferred from 1994; and (3)
     $5.2 million to complete the renovation at Gaithersburg Square.

              The Trust's long term debt has varying maturity dates and in a
     number of instances includes balloon payments or other contractual
     provisions that could require significant repayments during a particular
     period.  The next significant maturity is approximately $41.3 million of
     mortgage obligations which are due in 1998.

              The Trust intends to continue to acquire shopping centers in
     1995.  Acquisitions are targeted for the Trust's core major metropolitan
     markets of New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia and Baltimore/Washington,
     D.C. as well as the Chicago, Illinois and Boston, Massachusetts markets. 
     In addition, the Trust plans to acquire additional retail buildings in
     densely developed urban and suburban areas, such as the Ship's Building
     acquired in December 1994.  In February 1995 a 6,800 square foot retail
     building in downtown Greenwich, Connecticut was purchased for $2.0
     million.  The Trust is also continuing to study site acquisitions in its
     core markets to permit the Trust to develop  shopping centers.

              In January 1995 the Trust issued $100 million of 8 7/8% Senior
     Notes, netting $99.2 million.  The notes require interest payments semi-
     annually on January 15 and July 15 and are due January 15, 2000.  Proceeds
     from the notes were used, in part, to repay the $22.5 million mortgage on
     Northeast Plaza and to repay amounts outstanding on the credit facilities. 
     In order to protect itself against the risk that the general level of
     interest rates for such securities would rise before the senior notes were
     priced, in December 1994 the Trust entered into two interest rate hedge
     agreements on a total principal amount of $75.0 million.  The cost of the
     agreements, which terminated on January 20, 1995, was $21,000 which will
     be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes.  In January
     1995 the Trust executed an interest rate swap on $25.0 million, whereby
     the Trust swapped fixed interest payment obligations of 8.136% for a
     floating rate interest payment of three month LIBOR.  Consequently, the
     Trust will have a floating rate of interest on $25.0 million of the senior
     notes.

              The Trust believes that the combination of the remaining proceeds
     from the January 1995 senior note offering and the $130 million available
     under its revolving credit facilities provide it with the liquidity needed








     for its 1995 renovation and acquisition plans.  The Trust will need to
     raise equity or issue additional long term debt to meet its longer term
     capital and debt repayment needs.  The Trust believes that the
     unencumbered value of its properties and its access to the capital
     markets, as demonstrated by its past success in raising capital, give it
     the ability to raise the capital, both debt and equity, needed to fund
     these longer term needs.

     Contingencies
     -------------
              The State of New Jersey Division of Taxation has assessed the
     Trust $364,000 in taxes, penalty and interest for the years 1985 through
     1990, since the State has disallowed the dividends paid deduction in
     computing New Jersey taxable income.  The Trust is protesting this
     assessment since the Trust believes that it is entitled to the deduction. 
     At this time, the outcome of this matter is unknown;  however, in a case
     involving another real estate investment trust, the New Jersey tax court
     recently ruled that the dividends paid deduction was allowable.  However,
     the State of New Jersey has appealed this ruling.

              Included in the Trust's  investments is $3.1 million of Olympia
     and York Senior First Mortgage Notes.  The Olympia and York notes were
     written down during 1992 to management's best estimate of their net
     realizable value.  Interest income on these notes is not being recorded as
     revenue, but is being treated as a reduction of principal.

              As previously reported, certain of the Trust's shopping centers
     have some environmental contamination.  The North Carolina Department of
     the Environment, Health and Natural Resources ("DEHNR") issued a Notice of
     Violation ("NOV") against a former dry cleaner tenant at Eastgate Shopping
     Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina concerning a spill at the shopping
     center.  As owner of the shopping center, the Trust was named in and
     received a copy of the NOV.  Estimates to remediate the spill range from
     $300,000 to $500,000.  The Trust has entered into an agreement with two
     previous owners of the shopping center to share the costs to assess and
     remediate.  In 1993 the Trust recorded a liability of $120,000 as its
     estimated share of the clean up costs.

              In 1992 contaminants at levels in excess of New Jersey cleanup
     standards were identified at a shopping center in New Jersey.  The Trust
     has retained an environmental consultant to investigate the contamination. 
     The Trust is also evaluating whether it has insurance coverage for this
     matter.  At this time, the Trust is unable to determine what the range of
     remediation costs might be.  The Trust has also identified chlorinated
     solvent contamination at two other properties.  In each case, the
     contamination appears to be linked to the current and/or previous dry
     cleaner.  The Trust intends to look to the responsible parties for any
     remediation effort.  Evaluation of these situations is preliminary and it
     is impossible, at this time, to estimate the range of remediation costs,
     if any.










              The Trust reserved $2.25 million at closing in 1993 for
     environmental issues principally associated with Gaithersburg Square
     Shopping Center.  Pursuant to an indemnity agreement entered into with the
     seller at closing, the Trust agreed to take certain actions with respect
     to identified chlorinated solvent contamination.  The seller indemnified
     the Trust for certain third party claims and government requirements
     related to contamination at adjacent properties.

     Results of Operations
     ---------------------
              The effect of the Trust's recent acquisition, redevelopment and
     financing transactions is reflected in the Trust's operations.  Funds from
     operations, which is defined as income before depreciation and
     amortization and extraordinary items less gains on sale of real estate,
     increased 38% from $30.0 million in 1992 to $41.5 million in 1993 and
     increased 21% in 1994 to $50.3 million.  If funds from operations are
     adjusted to remove the effect of nonrecurring charges of $1.1 million,
     funds from operations would have increased 24% in 1994 to $51.3 million. 
     Management believes that funds from operations is an appropriate
     supplemental measure of the Trust's operating performance because it
     believes that reductions for depreciation and amortization charges are
     usually not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate, which
     have historically been appreciating assets.  The Trust acquires, evaluates
     and sells income producing properties based upon operating income without
     taking into account property depreciation and amortization charges.  Gains
     on sale of real estate and extraordinary items are also excluded from this
     supplemental measure of performance because such amounts are not part of
     the ongoing operations of the Trust's portfolio.  Funds from operations
     does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash
     provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

              The Trust's shopping center leases generally provide for minimum
     rents, with periodic increases.  Most shopping center tenants pay a
     majority of onsite operating expenses.  Many leases also contain a
     percentage rent clause which calls for additional rents based on tenant
     sales, so that at a given sales volume, if prices increase, so does rental
     income.  These features in the Trust leases reduce the Trust's exposure to
     higher costs caused by inflation, although inflation has not been
     significant in recent years.

              Rental income, which consists of minimum rent, percentage rent,
     and cost recoveries, increased 17.8% from $90.0 million in 1992 to $105.9
     million in 1993 and 20.9% in 1994 to $128.1 million.  If centers acquired
     and sold in 1992, 1993 and 1994 are excluded, rental income increased 8.7%
     from 1992 to 1993 and 6.1% from 1993 to 1994.  The components of rental
     income with the greatest change are minimum rent and common area
     maintenance recovery (CAM recovery). 

              Minimum rents increased 17.9% from $70.9 million in 1992 to $83.6
     million in 1993 and 19.4% in 1994 to $99.9 million.  If centers acquired
     and sold during these years are excluded, minimum rents increased 8.6%
     from 1992 to 1993.  Minimum rents increased 4% from 1993 to 1994, despite








     a $350,000 decrease in minimum rents at Congressional Plaza whose
     occupancy was reduced during its redevelopment in 1994.

              CAM recovery on the portfolio, adjusted to remove the effect of
     properties purchased in 1992, 1993 and 1994, increased from $7.6 million
     in 1992 to $8.2 million in 1993 to $11.5 million in 1994.  These increases
     correspond to increases in CAM expenses, primarily snow removal,
     landscaping and security.  Real estate tax recovery, after removing the
     effect of properties purchased during the past three years, showed a
     slight decline; a major component of this decline was due to lower
     occupancy and refunds due at Congressional Plaza, which has been under
     redevelopment.

              Other property income, which includes items  which tend to
     fluctuate from period to period, such as utility reimbursements, telephone
     income, merchant association dues, lease termination fees, late fees and
     temporary tenant income, increased from $4.7 million in 1992 to $5.5
     million in 1993 and to $5.7 million in 1994.  Part of the increase was due
     to the addition of new properties and part was due to the fluctuating
     nature of the income.

              Rental expenses increased from $20.9 million in 1992 to $26.5
     million in 1993 to $35.8 million in 1994, which represents 22.1% of
     property income (rental income plus other income) in 1992, 23.8% in 1993
     and 26.8% in 1994. The components of rental expense with the greatest
     percentage increase in both 1993 and 1994 are repairs and maintenance and
     other operating expenses and in 1994 ground rent. Snow removal expense, a
     component of repairs and maintenance, increased from approximately
     $270,000 in 1992 to approximately $910,000 in 1993 to over $2.4 million in
     1994, because of the new properties and because of increased expense on
     the core portfolio resulting from the harsh weather conditions during the
     past two winters. Other operating expenses have increased from 4.7% of
     property income in 1992 to 5.2% in 1993 to 5.8% in 1994 because of 
     increases in bad debt, environmental, marketing and grand opening
     expenses. Ground rent increased $2.1 million in 1994 over 1993 because of
     the acquisition of Bethesda Row on December 31, 1993, a large part of
     which is under ground lease.  If rental expenses are adjusted to remove
     the effect of properties purchased and sold in 1992, 1993 and 1994, rental
     expenses increased from $20.6 million in 1992 to $24.4 million in 1993 to
     $26.8 million in 1994.  Real estate taxes have declined slightly as a
     percentage of property income, from 9.4% in 1992 to 9.3% in 1993 to 9.0%
     in 1994.

              Depreciation and amortization charges increased because of the
     new acquisitions, but also because of depreciation on recent tenant work
     and property improvements.

              Interest income and expense have been affected by the Trust's
     financing transactions of the past three years.  Interest income was $5.5
     million in 1992 as compared to $3.9 million in 1993 and $3.9 million in
     1994.  In 1992 the Trust had higher average cash balances than in 1993 and
     1994, since in 1992 the Trust did not have immediate uses for all the








     proceeds from public offerings and temporarily invested the proceeds until
     they were used for acquisitions, renovations and debt repayments.  In 1993
     and 1994, proceeds from debt and equity offerings were used almost
     immediately to retire debt and to fund acquisitions and renovations.

              While total interest expense remained relatively constant in 1993
     and 1994,  the components have changed.  Decreases in interest expense,
     resulting from the repayment of several mortgages and the senior notes in
     1993 and the redemption on April 30, 1994 of the 5 1/4% convertible
     subordinated debentures due 2002, were offset by increases in interest
     expense because of the issuance of the 5 1/4% convertible subordinated
     debentures due 2003, the interest portion of the capital lease payment on
     Bethesda Row, and interest on increased usage of the revolving credit
     facilities.  The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.50x in 1993 and
     1.61x in 1994.  The ratio of funds from operations to fixed charges was
     2.29x in 1993 and 2.52x in 1994.

              Interest expense decreased from $35.2 million in 1992 to $31.6
     million in 1993, reflecting the redemption in 1993 of the senior notes and
     8 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures, the reduction in the 5 1/4%
     convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 and the prepayment of various
     mortgages, partially offset by the interest expense on the revolving
     credit facilities and interest on the 5 1/4% convertible subordinated
     debentures due 2003. 

              Administrative expenses are increasing as the Trust grows and as
     it seeks new acquisition and development opportunities.  Administrative
     expenses as a percentage of property income have gone from 4.3% in 1992 to
     4.2% in 1993 to 5.0% in 1994.  A major component of the increase in 1994
     over 1993 was an increase in costs connected with the review and analysis
     of potential property acquisitions which were not purchased.

              Other charges consists of three nonrecurring items in 1994. 
     During the third quarter of 1994 the Trust wrote down a mortgage note
     receivable and accrued interest thereon, totalling $758,000.  The mortgage
     note was issued in 1982 in connection with the sale by the Trust of a
     shopping center in Delaware.  Although the Trust will continue to pursue
     payment of the mortgage note, due to the current cash flow of the
     collateral property, collectibility is uncertain.  During the fourth
     quarter of 1994, the Trust recognized an unrealized loss of $449,000 on an
     investment in common shares of another real estate investment trust that
     it has  held since 1989, since it appears that its decline in value is
     permanent.  These two losses were partially offset by a $152,000 recovery
     of a legal settlement paid in 1987.  In 1992 other charges consisted of a
     $960,000 writedown of an investment in Olympia and York notes, partially
     offset by the recovery of another portion of the legal settlement paid in
     1987.

              Income before gain on sale of real estate and extraordinary item
     increased from $7.0 million in 1992 to $16.1 million in 1993 to $20.5
     million in 1994 reflecting increased revenues from the Trust's









     acquisitions, decreased interest expense resulting from its financing
     activities and growth in the core portfolio. 

              Gain on sale of real estate is dependent on the extent and timing
     of sales.  The 1992 gain was primarily due to the sale of two shopping
     centers.

              In 1993 the Trust had a net gain of $2.0 million on the early
     extinguishment of debt, resulting from a $3.1 million gain on the
     extinguishment of one mortgage, offset by losses on the redemption of the
     senior notes, convertible subordinated debentures and two other mortgages. 
     In 1992 the Trust had a net loss of $58,000 on the early extinguishment of
     debt, resulting from the prepayment of two mortgages and the exchange and
     repurchase of some of its 5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due
     2002.   

              As a result of the foregoing items, net income rose from $9.4
     million in 1992 to $18.1 million in 1993 to $20.5 million in 1994.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
     CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


     Trustees and Shareholders
     Federal Realty Investment Trust

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Federal
     Realty Investment Trust as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
     consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash
     flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. 
     These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust's
     management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
     financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
     obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
     free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
     basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
     statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
     used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
     the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
     provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
     in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Federal
     Realty Investment Trust as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the
     consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for
     each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994 in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     Federal Realty Investment Trust
     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992


     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

              Federal Realty Investment Trust invests predominantly in income-
     producing real estate properties, primarily community and neighborhood
     shopping centers.  

              The Trust uses the straight-line method in providing for
     depreciation.  Estimated useful lives range from three to 25 years on
     apartment buildings and improvements, and from three to 35 years on retail
     properties and improvements.  Maintenance and repair costs are charged to
     operations as incurred.  Major improvements are capitalized.  The gain or
     loss resulting from the sale of  properties is included in net income.

              The Trust capitalizes certain costs directly related to the
     acquisition, improvement and leasing of real estate including applicable
     salaries and other related costs.  The capitalized costs associated with
     unsuccessful acquisitions are charged to operations when that
     determination is made.  The capitalized costs associated with improvements
     and leasing are depreciated or amortized over the life of the improvement
     and lease, respectively.

              Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are capitalized
     and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the related issue
     using the interest method.  Upon conversion or in the event of redemption,
     applicable unamortized costs are charged to shareholders' equity or to
     operations, respectively.

              The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify
     as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal
     Revenue Code (the "Code").  Under those sections, a trust which
     distributes at least 95% of its real estate trust taxable income to its
     shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not
     be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
     shareholders.  Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is
     required.

              The Trust consolidates the financial statements of one wholly
     owned subsidiary, nine partnerships, and a joint venture which are
     controlled by the Trust. The equity interests of other investors are
     reflected as investors' interest in consolidated assets.  All significant
     intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.

              The Trust defines cash as cash on hand, demand deposits with
     financial institutions and short term liquid investments with an initial
     maturity under three months.  Cash balances may exceed insurable amounts.



                                          F9







              Earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number
     of shares outstanding during the respective periods, including options.

                               =======          ========         =========
       
          The Trust's 52 shopping centers are located in twelve
     states, primarily along the East Coast between the Boston metropolitan
     area and Richmond, Virginia.  There are approximately 1,500 tenants
     providing a wide range of retail products and services.  These tenants
     range from sole proprietorships to national retailers;  no one tenant or
     corporate group of tenants accounts for 5% or more of revenue.

          The  Trust purchased four shopping centers in 1994.  Idylwood Plaza
     in Falls Church, Virginia was purchased for $14.3 million in cash; North
     Lake Commons in Lake Zurich, Illinois was purchased for $10.9 million in
     cash;  Garden Market Shopping Center in Western Springs, Illinois was
     purchased for $7.6 million in cash; and Queen Anne Plaza in Norwell,
     Massachusetts was purchased for $10.7 million in cash and a $1.1 million
     note which was paid in January 1995.  In addition the Trust purchased a
     3.9 acre parcel of land underlying an Acme supermarket which adjoins its
     Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center for cash of $1.1 million and a retail building
     in Westport, Connecticut for cash of $3.8 million.

          During 1993 the Trust acquired seven shopping centers.  Pan Am
     Shopping Center in Fairfax, Virginia was acquired for $21.6 million in
     cash;  Gaithersburg Square in Gaithersburg, Maryland was purchased for
     $11.0 million in cash and the assumption of a $2.0 million liability which
     is the estimated cost to remediate certain preexisting environmental
     issues;  Quince Orchard Plaza in Gaithersburg, Maryland and its adjoining
     office building were purchased for $10.9 million in cash and the
     assumption of a liability of approximately $250,000 to remediate
     preexisting environmental issues;  Crossroads Shopping Center in Highland
     Park, Illinois was purchased for $16.2 million in cash;  Bala Cynwyd
     Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was purchased for
     $17.0 million in cash;  Dedham Plaza in Dedham, Massachusetts was
     purchased for $25.0 million in cash and the assumption of a $250,000
     liability to remediate existing environmental issues; and the leasehold

     interest in Bethesda Row in Bethesda, Maryland was acquired with $6.2
     million in cash.

          Mortgage notes receivable consist of three notes collateralized by
     shopping centers.  All three notes were issued in connection with either
     the acquisition or sale of Trust properties.  In 1994 a note for $700,000
     with accrued interest thereon was deemed uncollectible and therefore was
     written off.

          In January 1994 a $22.5 million one year mortgage was placed on
     Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia.  The mortgage, which bore interest at
     LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), plus 100 to 150 basis points was
     repaid in January 1995.  In 1993 the Trust prepaid mortgages on Laurel,
     Northeast and Northeast Plaza shopping centers, resulting in a net gain of
     $2.9 million which was  recorded as a component of the net gain on early
     extinguishment of debt.

          In November 1994 the Trust exercised an option to purchase the ground
     underlying the Northeast Shopping Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for
     $4.2 million, $3.4 million of which had been recorded as a capital lease
     obligation.

          Mortgages payable and capital lease obligations are due in
     installments over various terms extending to 2060 with actual or imputed
     interest rates ranging from 7.9% to 11.25%.  Certain of the mortgage and
     capital lease obligations require additional interest payments based upon
     property performance.

          Aggregate mortgage principal payments due during the next five years
     are $23.5 million, which includes the $22.5 million on Northeast Plaza
     referred to above, $1.1 million, $1.3 million, $43.7 million, and
     $574,000, respectively. 

          Future minimum lease payments and their present value for property
     under capital leases as of December 31, 1994 are as follows:

     Leasing Arrangements
     --------------------

         The Trust's leases with shopping center and apartment tenants are
     classified as operating leases.  Leases on apartments are generally for a
     period of one year, whereas shopping center leases generally range from
     three to 10 years and usually provide for contingent rentals based on
     sales and sharing of certain operating costs.


         The components of rental income are as follows:

     NOTE 2. INVESTMENTS
     -------------------

                 At December 31, 1994 the Trust had investments of $3.6
     million. Included in these investments is $4.7 million of Olympia and York
     Senior First Mortgage Notes due March 20, 1999, which are carried at $3.1
     million.  The Trust intends to hold these notes until maturity.  In 1992
     these notes were written down to management's best estimate of their net
     realizable value.  The other $500,000 of investments consists of
     marketable equity securities and mutual funds which are available for sale
     and which are stated at market.  In 1994 the Trust recognized an
     unrealized loss of $449,000 on equity securities, since the loss appears
     to be permanent.     

     NOTE 3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     -------------------------------------------
         The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by the
     Trust, using available market information and appropriate valuation
     methods.  Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimates of fair
     value.  The estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of
     the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the financial
     instruments.

         The Trust estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using
     the following methods and assumptions: (1) quoted market prices, when
     available, are used to estimate the fair value of investments in
     marketable debt and equity securities; (2) quoted market prices are used
     to estimate the fair value of the Trust's marketable convertible
     subordinated debentures; (3) discounted cash flow analyses are used to
     estimate the fair value of long term  notes receivable and payable, using
     the Trust's estimate of current interest rates for similar notes; (4)
     carrying amounts in the balace sheet approximate fair value for cash and
     short term borrowings.  Notes receivable from officers are excluded from
     fair value estimation since they have been issued in connection with
     employee stock ownership programs.

       **At December 31, 1993 the carrying value is the sum of the principal
     amount of $115.2 million plus the accrued premium on the convertible
     debentures due 2002.         
                                  

     NOTE 4. NOTES PAYABLE
     ---------------------
         At December 31, 1994 the Trust had notes payable of $61.9 million.  Of
     this balance, $54.7 million was issued under the Trust's revolving credit
     facilities and the balance of $7.2 million was issued in connection with
     the acquisition or renovation of Trust properties.  In  December 1994 the
     Trust issued a one month note payable for $1.1 million in connection with
     the purchase of Queen Anne Plaza.  The note which bore interest at 4% was
     paid in January 1995.  In 1993 the Trust issued a note for $3.0 million at
     an interest rate of 10%, payable in equal monthly installments with a
     final maturity in 2013 in connection with the renovation at Perring Plaza. 
     The balance of the $7.2 million relates primarily to a note issued in
     connection with the acquisition and renovation of Federal Plaza. The note 
     bears interest at 11% and matures in 1996.  

         At December 31, 1994 the Trust had $130 million of unsecured medium
     term revolving credit facilities with four banks.  The facilities, which
     bear interest at LIBOR plus 85 to 100 basis points, require fees and have
     covenants requiring a minimum shareholders's equity and a maximum ratio of
     debt to net worth.  The maximum drawn under these facilities during 1994
     was $54.7 million, which was outstanding at December 31.  The weighted
     average interest rate on borrowings during 1994 was 5.6% and the average
     amount outstanding was $26.3 million.    

         At December 31, 1993 the Trust had $70.0 million of unsecured medium
     term revolving credit facilities with three banks.  All three facilities
     required fees and had covenants requiring a minimum shareholders' equity
     and a maximum ratio of debt to net worth.  The maximum drawn under these
     facilities during 1993 was $64.1 million and at December 31, 1993 there
     was $24.4 million outstanding.  The weighted average interest rate on
     borrowings during 1993 was 4.2% and the average amount outstanding was
     $6.6 million.  

     NOTE 5. DIVIDENDS
     -----------------
         On November 10, 1994 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend
     of $.395 per share, payable January 13, 1995 to shareholders of record
     January 3, 1995.  For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
     $.75, $.45 and $.915 of dividends paid per share, respectively,
     represented a return of capital.

     NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
     -------------------------------------
         Pursuant to the provisions of the Loehmann's Plaza Limited Partnership
     Agreement, on or after September 1, 1995 the limited partner may require
     the Trust to purchase his interest in the Partnership at its then fair
     market value.

                                         F14







         The Congressional Plaza Shopping Center Joint Venture Agreement
     provides that the Trust may be required to purchase its pro rata share of
     one venturer's 22.5% or greater joint venture interest for a purchase
     price based on the appraised fair market value of the shopping center, but
     no less than the percentage of joint venture interest being sold
     multiplied by the difference between $17.5 million and the remaining
     principal balance of any liabilities of the Joint Venture.

         The State of New Jersey Division of Taxation has assessed the Trust
     $364,000 in taxes, penalty and interest for the years 1985 through 1990,
     since the State has disallowed the dividends paid deduction in computing
     New Jersey taxable income.  The Trust is protesting this assessment since
     the Trust believes that it is entitled to the deduction.  At this time,
     the outcome of this matter is unknown;  however, in a case involving
     another real estate investment trust, the New Jersey tax court recently
     ruled that the dividends paid deduction was allowable.  However, the State
     of New Jersey has appealed this ruling.

         Certain of the Trust's shopping centers have some environmental
     contamination.  The North Carolina Department of the Environment, Health
     and Natural Resources ("DEHNR") issued a Notice of Violation ("NOV")
     against a former dry cleaner tenant at Eastgate Shopping Center in Chapel
     Hill, North Carolina concerning a spill at the shopping center.  As owner
     of the shopping center, the Trust was named in and received a copy of the
     NOV.  Estimates to remediate the spill range from $300,000 to $500,000. 
     The Trust has entered into an agreement with two previous owners of the
     shopping center to share the costs to assess and remediate.  In 1993 the
     Trust recorded a liability of $120,000 as its estimated share of the clean
     up costs. 

         In 1992 contaminants at levels in excess of New Jersey cleanup
     standards were identified at a shopping center in New Jersey.  The Trust
     has retained an environmental consultant to investigate the contamination. 
     The Trust is also evaluating whether it has insurance coverage for this
     matter.  At this time, the Trust is unable to determine what the range of
     remediation costs might be.  The Trust has also identified chlorinated
     solvent contamination at two other properties.  In each case, the
     contamination appears to be linked to the current and/or previous dry
     cleaner.  The Trust intends to look to the responsible parties for any
     remediation effort.  Evaluation of these situations is preliminary and it
     is impossible, at this time, to estimate the range of remediation costs,
     if any.

         The Trust reserved $2.25 million at closing in 1993 for environmental
     issues, principally associated with Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center. 
     Pursuant to an indemnity agreement entered into with the seller at
     closing, the Trust agreed to take certain actions with respect to
     identified chlorinated solvent contamination.  The seller indemnified the
     Trust for certain third party claims and government requirements related
     to contamination at adjacent properties.

         A non qualified deferred compensation plan for Trust officers was
     established in 1994.  The plan allows the officers to defer future income
     until the earlier of age 65 or termination of employment with the Trust. 
     As of December 31, 1994, approximately $99,000 of compensation had been
     deferred under this plan.  Although this is an unfunded plan, the Trust
     has purchased certain investments with which to match this obligation.

         The Trust has entered into agreements with certain key employees
     whereby if these employees voluntarily or involuntarily leave the
     employment of the Trust within six months after a "change of control"
     (defined as control of 35% or more of outstanding shares) of the Trust,
     they will be entitled to a lump sum cash payment equal to one to three
     times their annual salary as of the date of termination and have their
     health and welfare benefits and executive privileges continued for a
     period of one to three years.  In the event of a change of control, the
     Trust also agreed that all restrictions on the exercise or receipt of any
     stock options and stock grants shall lapse upon termination of employment
     and that all shares owned at termination shall be redeemed by the Trust at
     a formula price.  

         The Trust had previously entered into employment agreements with its
     President and certain other key employees for terms of up to three years,
     which automatically renewed at the end of each month unless either party
     notified the other that it elected not to extend the term.  During 1994
     the Trust offered certain of the employees covered under these agree-
     ments, other than the President, a severance agreement in lieu of the
     employment agreement.  Two employees retained their employment agreements,
     which agreements now have a fixed term.  The severance agreement prescribes
     that, among other things, if the employee is terminated without cause,
     he/she is entitled to salary for up to 18 months and benefits for up to
     nine months.

         As of December 31, 1994 in connection with the renovation of certain
     shopping centers, the Trust has contractual obligations of $3.1 million. 
     In addition the Trust is contractually obligated to provide up to $10.1
     million for tenant improvements and $2.6 million to buy out tenant leases.

         The Trust is obligated under ground lease agreements on several
     shopping centers requiring minimum annual payments as follows:

     -----------------------------------------------------------

                                         F16







         In October 1993 the Trust issued $75.0 million of 5 1/4% convertible
     subordinated debentures, realizing cash proceeds of approximately $73.0
     million.  The debentures were not registered under the Securities Act of
     1933, and were not publicly distributed within the United States.  The
     debentures, which mature in 2003, are convertible into shares of
     beneficial interest at $36 per share.  The debentures are redeemable by
     the Trust, in whole, at any time after October 28, 1998 at 100% of the
     principal amount plus accrued interest.  

     NOTE 8. 5 1/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE 2002
     -----------------------------------------------------------
         At December 31, 1994 and 1993 the Trust had outstanding $289,000 and
     $40.2 million, respectively, of 5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures
     due 2002.  The debentures which are convertible into shares of beneficial
     interest at $30.625 were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933
     and were not publicly distributed within the United States.

         In April 1994, $39.8 million of the debentures were redeemed at a
     price equal to 120% of their principal amount or $47.8 million, in
     accordance with a premium put.  A principal amount of $53,000 of these
     debentures was converted into 1,729 shares in 1994.  During 1993 the Trust
     purchased $3.7 million of these debentures, resulting in a loss of $74,000
     which was recorded as a component of the net gain on early extinguishment
     of debt.  

     NOTE 9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     ----------------------------
         In April 1994 the Trust raised net proceeds of $61.3 million from a
     public offering of 2.5 million shares of beneficial interest ("shares"). 
     In a concurrent offering of 840,000 shares to an institutional investor,
     the Trust raised net proceeds of $21.7 million.  In April 1993 the Trust
     sold 2.8 million shares in a public offering, raising net proceeds of
     $72.8 million.  In December 1993 the Trust sold 220,000 shares for $5.4
     million in a private placement in connection with the long term lease of a
     property.  In June 1992 the Trust sold 3.4 million shares in a public
     offering, raising net proceeds of $66.5 million.

         The Trust has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, whereby shareholders may
     use their dividends to purchase shares.  In March 1993 the Trust
     registered an additional 500,000 shares with the Securities and Exchange
     Commission in connection with the plan.  In 1994, 1993, and 1992, 162,466
     shares, 131,620 shares and 132,189 shares, respectively, were issued under
     the Plan.

         On January 1, 1994 under the terms of the 1993 Long Term Incentive
     Plan, an officer of the Trust purchased 40,000 common shares at $25 per
     share with the assistance of a $1.0 million loan from the Trust.  The
     loan, which has a term of 12 years, bears interest at 6.24%.  One-
     sixteenth of the loan will be forgiven on January 31, 1995.  Forgiveness
     of up to 75% of the loan is subject to the future performance of the Trust.


                                         F17







         In January 1991 the Trustees adopted the Federal Realty Investment
     Trust Share Purchase Plan.  Under the terms of this plan, officers and
     certain employees of the Trust purchased 446,000 common shares at $15.125
     per share with the assistance of loans of $6.7 million from the Trust. 
     Originally, the Plan called for one-sixteenth of the loan to be forgiven
     each year for eight years, as long as the participant was still employed
     by the Trust.  The loans for all participants, but two, were modified in
     1994 to extend the term an additional four years and to tie forgiveness in
     1995 and thereafter to certain performance criteria of the Trust.  The
     Trust has loaned participants $675,000 to pay the taxes due in connection
     with the plan.  The purchase loans and the tax loans bear interest at
     9.39%.  The shares purchased under the plan may not be sold, pledged or
     assigned until both the purchase and tax loans are satisfied and the term
     has expired.

         Under the terms of the 1988 Share Bonus Plan, 108,000 shares were
     granted to officers and key employees.  During the years ended December
     31, 1993 and 1992 the last 4,000 shares and 22,500 shares, respectively,
     were vested and charged to operations.  In connection with these shares,
     the Trust has made loans to the participants to pay the taxes due in
     connection with the plan.  The notes bear interest at the lesser of (i)
     the Trust's borrowing rate or (ii) the Trust's current indicated annual
     dividend rate divided by the purchase price of such shares.  Notes issued
     under this plan are being forgiven over three years from issuance if the
     officer is still employed by the Trust.  During the years ended December
     31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, $74,000, $80,000 and $60,000, respectively, was
     forgiven.

         In connection with a restricted share grant, the Trust accepted from
     the President a noninterest bearing note for $210,000.  One installment of
     $105,000 was paid on the note in 1992 and the second installment is due
     April 15, 1996.

         The Trust owns shares of other real estate investment trusts ("REITs")
     as a long term investment.  The Trust's cost of these shares was $887,000. 
     In 1994 the Trust recognized an unrealized loss of $449,000 on these
     shares, since it appears that the decline in value of one investment is
     permanent.  Due to temporary price declines in the other REITs, the Trust
     had an allowance for unrealized losses of $53,000 as of December 31, 1994. 

         At December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992 the Trust had 60,200 shares in
     treasury at a cost of $1.1 million.

         On April 13, 1989, the Trustees adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (the
     Plan).  Under the Plan, one right was issued for each outstanding share of
     common stock held as of April 24, 1989, and a right will be attached to
     each share issued in the future.  The rights are exercisable into common
     shares upon the occurrence of certain events, including acquisition by a
     person or group of certain levels of beneficial ownership or a tender
     offer by such a person or group. The rights are redeemable by the Trust
     for $.01 and expire on April 24, 1999.

     NOTE 10. STOCK OPTION PLAN
     --------------------------
         The 1993 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Plan") was approved by
     shareholders in May 1993.  On the date of approval, 472,500 options were
     awarded to officers, employees and nonemployee Trustees.  On December 16,
     1993, 69,000 options were awarded to employees.  Under the Plan, on each
     annual meeting date during the term of the plan, each non employee Trustee
     will be awarded 2,500 options.  Accordingly on May 4, 1994, 20,000 options
     were awarded to non employee Trustees.

         The option price to acquire shares under the 1993 Plan and previous
     plans is required to be at least the fair market value at the date of
     grant.  As a result of the exercise of options, the Trust has outstanding
     from its officers and employees notes for $2.0 million.  The notes issued
     under the 1993 plan bear interest at the dividend rate on the date of
     exercise divided by the purchase price of such shares.  The notes issued
     under the previous plans bear interest at the lesser of (i) the Trust's
     borrowing rate or (ii) the current indicated annual dividend rate on the
     shares acquired pursuant to the option, divided by the purchase price of

     NOTE 11. SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN
     ------------------------------------
         The Trust has a savings and retirement plan in accordance with the
     provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the
     plan, the Trust, out of its current net income, contributed 50% of each

                                         F19







     employee's contribution.  Employees' contributions range, at the
     discretion of each employee, from 1% to 5% of compensation.  In addition,
     the Trust may make discretionary contributions within the limits of
     deductibility set forth by the Code.  Employees of the Trust, who work
     over 1,000 hours annually, are eligible to become plan participants.  The
     Trust's expense for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was
     $147,000, $133,000 and $100,000, respectively.

     NOTE 12. INTEREST EXPENSE
     -------------------------
         The Trust incurred interest expense totalling $31.8 million, $31.8
     million and $35.4 million, in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, of which
     $348,000, $216,000 and $237,000, respectively, was capitalized.  Interest
     paid was $39.9 million in 1994 which included $8.0 million of the premium
     on the 5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures which were redeemed in
     April 1994. Interest paid in 1993 was $31.4 million and in 1992, $36.9
     million.

     NOTE 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
     --------------------------
         On January 19, 1995 the Trust issued $100 million of 8-7/8% Senior
     Notes due January 15, 2000, netting proceeds of $99.2 million.  The notes,
     which are not redeemable prior to maturity, pay interest semiannually on
     January 15 and July 15 of each year.  Proceeds from this offering were
     used to pay off amounts drawn under the Trust's revolving credit
     facilities and the $22.5 million mortgage on Northeast Plaza.

         In order to protect itself against the risk that the general level of
     interest rates for such securities would rise before the senior notes were
     priced, in December 1994 the Trust entered into two interest rate hedge
     agreements on a total principal amount of  $75.0 million.  The cost of the
     agreements, which terminated on January 20, 1995, was $21,000 which will
     be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes.

         In January 1995, the Trust executed an interest rate swap on $25.0
     million, whereby the Trust swapped fixed interest payment obligations of
     8.136% for a floating rate interest payment of three month LIBOR. 
     Consequently the Trust will have a floating rate of interest on $25.0
     million of the senior notes.

         On February 15, 1995 719,000 options at $20.75 were issued to
     employees of the Trust.

         On February 16, 1995 the Trust purchased a 6,800 square foot retail
     building in Greenwich, Connecticut for $2.0 million cash.

         September 30                28,898   4,538        .16
         December 31                 31,351   8,246(3)     .31

     1)  Income before extraordinary item was $2.6 million or $.10 per share.
     2)  Income before extraordinary item was $3.8 million or $.14 per share.
     3)  Income before extraordinary item was $5.2 million or $.19 per share.

         The increasing revenue and net income during the past two years are
     primarily due to the expansion of the Trust's portfolio and lower interest
     costs.  During the second quarter of 1993 the Trust had a loss on the
     early retirement of debt of $.04 per share  and in the fourth quarter of
     1993 a gain on the early retirement of debt of $.11 per share.
