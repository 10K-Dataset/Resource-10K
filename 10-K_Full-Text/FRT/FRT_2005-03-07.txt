FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004




PART I

Item 1.    Business

References to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Trust” refer to Federal Realty Investment Trust and our business and operations conducted through our directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries.

GENERAL

We are an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
specializing in the ownership, management, development and redevelopment of high-quality retail and mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2004, we owned or had a majority ownership interest in 106 community and neighborhood shopping centers and
retail mixed-use properties comprising approximately 16.9 million square feet, located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States, as well as California and one apartment complex
in Maryland. In total, these 106 commercial properties were 95.1% leased at December 31, 2004. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned four neighborhood shopping centers totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet as of December 31,
2004. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962, and have increased our dividend rate for 37 consecutive years. Revenue, profit and total assets of each reportable segment are described in the
financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

We
were founded in 1962 under the laws of the District of Columbia and reformed as a real estate investment trust in the state of Maryland in 1999. Our principal executive offices are located at 1626 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852 and
our telephone number is (301) 998-8100. Our Web site address is

www.federalrealty.com

. The information contained on our Web site is not a part of this report.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES

Our primary business objective is to own, manage, acquire and redevelop a portfolio of commercial retail properties, with the dominant property type being
grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers, that will:

•

generate higher internal growth than our peers;

•

protect investor capital;

•

provide increasing cash flow for quarterly distributions to shareholders; and

•

provide potential for capital appreciation.

Our traditional focus has been on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers. Late in 1994, recognizing a trend of increased consumer
acceptance and retailer expansion to main streets; we expanded our investment strategy to include “street retail” and “mixed-use” properties. The mixed-use properties are typically centered around a retail component but may also
include office, residential and hotel components in established main street shopping areas. In addition, from 1997 through 2001, we undertook the ground-up development in urban areas of mixed-use projects that center around the retail component. In
2002, our Board of Trustees approved the adoption of a business plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of owning, managing, acquiring and redeveloping high quality retail properties in our core markets.

Operating Strategies

Our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by
attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker, underperforming tenants with stronger ones. Our properties are generally located in some of the most densely



populated and affluent areas of the country. In addition, because of the in-fill nature of our locations, our centers generally face less competition per
capita than centers owned by our peers. These strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales, which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates, charge higher rental rates, and maintain steady rent growth, all of which increases the
value of our portfolio. Our operating strategies also include:

•

maintaining a diversified tenant base, thereby limiting exposure to any one tenant’s financial difficulties;

•

monitoring the credit mix of our tenant base to achieve a balance of strong national and regional tenants with local specialty tenants;

•

minimizing overhead and operating costs;

•

monitoring the physical appearance of our properties and the construction quality, condition and design of the buildings and other improvements located on our properties to maximize
our ability to generate high rental and occupancy rates;

•

developing local and regional market expertise in order to capitalize on market and retailing trends;

•

leveraging the contacts and experience of our management team to build and maintain long-term relationships with tenants, investors and financing sources;

•

increasing rental rates through the renewal or releasing of expiring leases at higher rental rates and by limiting vacancy and down-time; and

•

providing exceptional customer service.

Investing Strategies

Our investment strategy calls for deploying capital at risk-adjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that
have potential for future net income growth equal to, or in excess of, the historical net income growth of our core portfolio of properties.

Our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories:

•

renovating, expanding, reconfiguring and/or retenanting our existing properties to take advantage of under-utilized land or existing square footage to increase our internal growth
rate;

•

acquiring community and neighborhood shopping centers, located in densely populated or growing affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high, and that have
possibilities for enhancing operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and/or retenanting;

•

renovating or expanding tenant spaces for tenants capable of producing higher sales, and therefore, paying higher rents, including expanding space available to an existing tenant
that is performing well but is operating out of an old or otherwise inefficient store format; and

•

acquiring, in partnership with longer term investors who contribute a substantial portion of the equity needed to acquire those properties, stabilized community and neighborhood
shopping centers, located in densely populated or growing affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high and that have limited potential for significant growth.

Investment Criteria

When we evaluate potential redevelopment, retenanting, expansion and acquisition opportunities, we consider such factors as:

•

the expected returns in relation to our cost of capital as well as the anticipated risk we will face in achieving the expected returns;



•

the anticipated growth rate of operating income generated by the property;

•

the tenant mix at the property, tenant sales performance and the creditworthiness of those tenants;

•

the geographic area in which the property is located, including the population density and household incomes, as well as the population and income trends in that geographic area;

•

competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property, including competition for tenants and the ability to create competing properties through redevelopment, new construction or
renovation;

•

access to and visibility of the property from existing roadways and the potential for new, widened or realigned, roadways within the property’s trade area, which may affect
access and commuting and shopping patterns;

•

the level and success of our existing investments in the market area;

•

the current market value of the land, buildings and other improvements and the potential for increasing those market values; and

•

the physical condition of the land, buildings and other improvements, including the structural and environmental condition.

Financing Strategies

Our financing strategies are designed to enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility
to fund our operating and investing activities in the most cost-efficient way possible. Our financing strategies include:

•

maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an adequate pool of unencumbered properties;

•

actively managing our exposure to variable-rate debt;

•

utilizing the most advantageous long-term source of capital available to us to finance redevelopment and acquisition opportunities, which may include:

•

the sale of our equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements,

•

the incurrence of indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings,

•

the issuance of operating units in a new or existing “downREIT partnership” (the operating units generally receive the same distributions as our common shares and may be
convertible into our common shares, in exchange for a tax deferred contribution of property), or

•

the use of joint venture arrangements;

•

taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt, reduce interest costs and manage our debt maturity schedule; and

•

selling properties that have limited growth potential or are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio and redeploying the proceeds to redevelop, renovate, retenant and/or
expand our existing properties, acquire new properties or reduce debt.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2004, we had 262
full-time employees and 140 part-time employees. None of the employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

TAX STATUS

We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1962. As a REIT we are generally not
subject to federal income tax on REIT taxable income that



we distribute to our shareholders. Under the internal revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we prefer as to the Code, REITs are subject to numerous
organizational and operational requirements, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income each year. We will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) at
regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of REIT taxable income. We will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise
taxes on our undistributed REIT taxable income. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR PROPERTIES

We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and similar laws, including:

•

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA;

•

the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act;

•

the Federal Clean Water Act;

•

the Federal Clean Air Act;

•

the Toxic Substances Control Act;

•

the Occupational Safety & Health Act; and

•

the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the former uses of the
property, the building materials used at each property and the physical layout of the property. Under certain environmental laws, principally CERCLA, we, as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned, may be required to
investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances, asbestos-containing materials, or petroleum product releases at the property. We may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for
investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination, whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the
government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. As the owner or operator of real estate, we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination
emanating from the real estate. Such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to
borrow using the real estate as collateral.

Neither existing
environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe they will in the future. In
addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws
or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. We have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and we carry environmental
insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties.



COMPETITION

Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the tenant leasing and the acquisition of properties. Some of
these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do, although no single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located is believed to be dominant in that market. This competition may:

•

reduce the number of properties available for acquisition;

•

increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;

•

reduce rents payable to us;

•

interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates, and

•

adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.

Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, and other forms of marketing of goods and
services, such as direct mail, internet marketing and telemarketing. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.

Item 2.    Properties

General

As of December 31, 2004, we owned or
had a majority ownership interest in 106 community and neighborhood shopping centers and retail mixed-used properties comprising approximately 16.9 million square feet, located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States, as well as California. In addition we own one apartment complex in Maryland. No single property accounted for over 10% of our 2004 total revenue or net income. We believe that our properties are adequately
covered by commercial general liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies, with commercially reasonable exclusions, deductibles and limits.

We operate our business on an asset management model, where small, focused
teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets. We have divided our portfolio of properties into two operating regions: the East and West. Each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager, with dedicated leasing, property management
and financial staff, and operates largely autonomously with respect to day-to-day operating decisions.



Tenant Diversification

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 2,200 tenants, ranging from sole proprietors to major national retailers. No one tenant or affiliated
group of tenants accounted for more than 2.3% of our annualized base rent as of December 31, 2004. As a result of our tenant diversification, we believe our exposure to recent and future bankruptcy filings in the retail sector has not been and will
not be significant.

Geographic Diversification

Our 107 properties are located in 14 states and the District of Columbia.
The following table shows, by region and state within the region, the number of properties, the gross leasable area and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area in each state as of December 31, 2004.

Leases, Lease Terms and Lease
Expirations

Our leases are classified as operating leases
and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance, subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease; percentage rents based on our tenants’ gross sales volumes, and reimbursement of a majority of
on-site operating expenses and real estate taxes. These features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs caused by inflation and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales.

Commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years; however,
certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer. Many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at pre-established rates that often include fixed rent increases, consumer price index
adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent. Leases on apartments are generally for a period of one year or less and, in 2004, represented approximately 3.2% of total revenues.



The following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of
December 31, 2004 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2005, assuming that none of the tenants exercise their future renewal options. Annualized base rents reflect in-place contractual rents as of December 31, 2004.

Retail and Residential Properties

The following table sets forth information concerning all
properties, in which we own an equity interest or have a leasehold interest and are consolidated as of December 31, 2004. Except as otherwise noted, we are the sole owner of our retail properties. Principal tenants are the largest tenants in the
property based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a property’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Neither we nor any of our properties are currently subject to any legal proceeding which we believe creates material exposure to us nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation currently threatened against us or
any of our properties. Under our leases, tenants are typically obligated to indemnify us from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses imposed upon or asserted against us (1) as owner of the properties due to certain matters relating to the
operation of the properties by the tenant, and (2) where appropriate, due to certain matters relating to the ownership of the properties prior to their acquisition by us.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Shareholders

No matters were submitted to a vote of our shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.



PART II

Item 5.    Market for Our Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “FRT.” Listed below are the high and low
closing prices of our common shares as reported on the New York Stock Exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated.

On March 2, 2005,
there were 4,937 holders of record of our common shares.

Our
ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our REIT status and distribute to shareholders at least 100% of our REIT taxable income. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and
operational requirements, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income. State income taxes are not material to our operations or cash flows.

Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Trustees and will depend on our actual net income available
for common shareholders, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Board of Trustees deems relevant. We have paid quarterly dividends to our
shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our annual dividend rate for 37 consecutive years.

Our total annual dividends paid per share for 2004 and 2003 were $1.975 per share and $1.945 per share, respectively. The annual dividend amounts are
different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes. Distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend
income. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares, to the extent thereof, and thereafter as taxable capital
gain. Distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain, or reducing the amount of loss, recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares. No
assurances can be given regarding what portion, if any, of distributions in 2005 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. During a year in which a REIT earns a net long-term capital gain, the REIT can
elect under Code Sec. 857(b)(3) to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends. If this election is made, then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as long-term capital gains. For 2004, a
portion of our distributions was designated as a capital gain dividend.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Shares

During
2004 and 2003, we issued 123,130 and 76,952 common shares, respectively, upon the redemption of operating partnership units held by persons who received units in earlier periods in exchange for contribution of real estate to limited partnerships
that we control. The common shares were issued without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance on Section 4(2) of that Act.



In 2005, we issued 190,000 common shares without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 in
reliance on Section 4(2) of that Act upon the redemption of operating partnership units. We intend to ultimately register these shares under the Securities Act of 1933.

The following table reflects the income tax status of distributions paid during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
to common shareholders:

Distributions on our
8.5% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares are payable at the rate of $2.125 per share per annum, prior to distributions on our common shares. Our 7.95% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares paid distributions at a rate of
$1.9875 per share per annum and were redeemed in full in June 2003. We do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements will have an adverse
effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.



Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

The following table includes certain financial information on a consolidated
historical basis. You should read this section in conjunction with “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Our selected operating data, other data and balance sheet data for the years ended 2000 through 2003 may have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the year ended 2004.



1)

Determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows.

2)

Funds from Operations (“FFO”) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with the U.S. GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains on the sale of real estate. We
compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and we have historically reported our FFO available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities.

We consider FFO available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption
that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of GAAP and the recording of depreciation. We use FFO primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in
comparison with other REITs. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. Additional
information regarding our calculation of FFO is contained in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows:



3)

Includes $3.1 million and $8.0 million of insurance proceeds in 2004 and 2003, respectively, attributable to rental income lost at Santana Row as a result of the August 2002 fire.
Excluding these items, funds from operations in 2004 and 2003 would have been $156.0 million and $140.5 million, respectively.

4)

Earnings consist of net income before gain (loss) on sale of real estate and fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest on borrowed funds (including capitalized interest),
amortization of debt discount and expense and the portion of rent expense representing an interest factor. Preferred share dividends consist of dividends paid on our outstanding Series A preferred shares and Series B preferred shares. Our Series A
preferred shares were redeemed in full in June 2003.

5)

The SEC has stated that EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure calculated as in the below table. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that means net income or loss plus interest expense,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment provisions, and nonrecurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe that it provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service debt and because it
approximates a key covenant in material notes. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other REITs.

The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for
the periods presented is as follows:

Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this report.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Also, documents that we “incorporate by reference”
into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including documents that we subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the SEC, will contain forward-looking statements. When we refer to forward-looking statements or
information, sometimes we use words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “plans,” “intends,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates”
and “continues.” In particular, the risk factors included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K describe forward-looking information. The risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not
all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. Many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. These factors include, but are not limited to the risk factors described in our current
report in Form 8-K filed on March 2, 2005, and include the following:

•

risks that our tenants will not pay rent or that we may be unable to renew leases or re-let space at favorable rents as leases expire;

•

risks that we may not be able to proceed with or obtain necessary approvals for any redevelopment or renovation project, and that any redevelopment or renovation project that we do
pursue may not perform as anticipated;



•

risks that the number of properties we acquire for our own account, and therefore the amount of capital we invest in acquisitions, may be impacted by our real estate partnership;

•

risks normally associated with the real estate industry, including risks that:

•

occupancy levels at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive from our properties may be lower than expected,

•

completion of anticipated or ongoing property redevelopments or renovations may fail to perform as expected,

•

that new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected,

•

competition for acquisitions could result in increased prices for acquisitions,

•

environmental issues may develop risks at our properties and result in unanticipated costs, and

•

because real estate is illiquid, that we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate;

•

risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital;

•

risks of financing, such as our ability to consummate additional financings or obtain replacement financing on terms which are acceptable to us, our ability to meet existing
financial covenants and the limitations imposed on our operations by those covenants, and the possibility of increases in interest rates that would result in increased interest expense; and

•

risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust, commonly referred to as a REIT, for federal income tax purposes, such as the existence of complex tax regulations
relating to our status as a REIT, the effect of future changes in REIT requirements as a result of new legislation, and the adverse consequences of the failure to qualify as a REIT.

Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on any forward-looking statements that we make, including those in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. You should carefully review the risks and the risk factors incorporated herein by reference from our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2005 before making any investments in us.

Overview

We are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership, management, development and redevelopment of
high-quality retail and mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2004, we owned or had a majority interest in 106 community and neighborhood shopping centers and retail mixed-use properties comprising approximately 16.9 million square feet, located
primarily in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States, as well as California and one apartment complex in Maryland. In total, the 106 commercial properties were 95.1% leased at December 31,
2004. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned four neighborhood shopping centers totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet as of December 31, 2004. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our
founding in 1962, and have increased our dividend rate for 37 consecutive years.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which we refer to as GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. In
addition, information relied upon by



management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information when available, and
when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate or accrual results could have a
material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

The most significant accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Base rents are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases, net of valuation adjustments, based on management’s assessment of credit, collection and other business risk. We make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts
receivable related to base rents, including receivables from recording rent on a straight-line basis, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income taking into account payment history, industry trends and the period of recovery. In doing so, we
generally do not recognize income from straight-line rents due to be collected beyond ten years because of uncertainty of collection. In most cases, the ultimate collectibility of these claims extends beyond one year. These estimates have a direct
impact on our net income. Historically, we have recognized bad debt expense between 1.0% and 1.5% of rental income and was 1.5% in 2004. An increase in our bad debt expense would decrease our net income. For example, if we had experienced an
increase in bad debt of 0.5% of rental income in 2004, our net income would have been reduced by approximately $1.9 million.

Real Estate

The nature of our business as an owner, re-developer and operator of retail shopping centers means that we invest significant amounts of capital.
Depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our shopping centers and mixed-use properties constitutes a substantial cost for the Trust as well as the industry as a whole. The Trust capitalizes real estate investments and depreciates it in
accordance with GAAP and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives. The cost of our real estate investments, less salvage value, if any, is charged to depreciation expense
over the estimated life of the asset using straight-line rates for financial statement purposes. We periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes, as necessary, to these estimates and, therefore, to our depreciation
rates. These reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets, the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets, the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general
economic and real estate factors. A newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years, but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings, estimating the useful lives of
assets that are long-lived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment. The longer the economic useful life, the lower the depreciation charged to that asset in a fiscal period will be, which in turn will increase our net
income. Similarly, using a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income.

Land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging
generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant work and other major improvements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are
capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15
years. Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real estate, including applicable salaries and the related direct costs, are capitalized. The capitalized costs associated with developments
and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement. Capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease. Unamortized leasing costs are charged to



operations if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease. Undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant
vacates and the tenant work is replaced.

When applicable, as
lessee, we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” We are required to use judgment and
make estimates in determining the lease term, the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of SFAS No. 13. These estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a
capital lease and is recorded as an asset.

We are required to
make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis. These assessments have a direct impact on net income. Certain events could occur that would
materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on investment in the
property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge against both the current and future revenues. We will continue to periodically review the lives of assets and any decrease in asset
lives could have the effect of increasing depreciation expense while any analysis indicating that lives are longer than we have assumed could have the effect of decreasing depreciation expense. In order to determine the impact on depreciation
expense of a different average life of our real estate assets taken as a whole, we used 25 years, which is the approximate average life of all assets being depreciated at the end of 2004. If the estimated useful lives of all assets being depreciated
were increased by one year, the consolidated depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately $3.2 million.

Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service.
Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. Generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its
intended use upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on
net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that
period.

Long-Lived Assets

There are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the
consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets, including our properties that have been acquired or developed. Management must evaluate
properties for possible impairment of value and, for those properties where impairment may be indicated, make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market
conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over very long periods. Because our properties typically have a very long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management
judgment.

In August 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (effective for us on January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and
used or newly-acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of
the entity. As a result, the sale of a property, or the classification of a property as held for sale, requires us to report the results of operations and cash flows of that property as “discontinued operations.”



We are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining whether there is an
impairment of an asset. Actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. These estimates have a direct impact on net income, because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income.

Contingencies

We are sometimes involved in lawsuits and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management makes
assumptions and estimates concerning the amount and likelihood of loss relating to these matters. The estimates and assumptions relating to potential loss result in a decrease in net income.

Self-Insurance

We are self-insured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts, and we believe that we maintain
adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. We maintain third party stop-loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. Our accrual for self-insurance liability is determined by management and is
based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Management considers a number of factors, including third-party actuary valuations, when making these determinations. If our liability costs exceed these accruals, it
will reduce our net income.

Recent Developments

On February 15, 2005 we sold two properties located in Tempe, Arizona for
$13.7 million, resulting in a gain of $4.0 million.

On March
2, 2005, we acquired Assembly Square, an approximately 330,000 square foot enclosed mall that is currently being redeveloped into a power center, and an adjacent 220,000 square foot retail/industrial complex for $64 million. The properties are
located in the City of Somerville, Massachusetts. The acquisition was financed through available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

The Trust expects to invest an additional $38 million to complete the redevelopment of the mall into a power center, with stabilization anticipated within
12 months. The acquisition of Assembly Square also includes zoning entitlements to add four mixed-use buildings on 3.5 acres, which will include approximately 41,000 square feet of retail space, 51,000 square feet of office and 239 residential
units.

The 10-acre parcel, which comprises approximately
220,000 square feet of improvements, is currently 100% leased to a mix of quasi-retail and industrial uses. This parcel also includes an option to purchase adjacent land parcels from the Somerville Redevelopment Authority, all of which are zoned for
dense, mixed-use development.

2004 Property Acquisitions and Dispositions

On March 31, 2004, we acquired Westgate Mall, a 637,000
square foot shopping center located in San Jose, California. The purchase price of the property of $97.0 million was paid from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which were subsequently repaid from the net proceeds of our April 2004
common equity offering.

On June 3, 2004, we sold a parcel of
land at the Village at Shirlington in Arlington, Virginia for $4.9 million. This transaction related to a previous land sale to Arlington County, Virginia, for $0.3 million, which closed in March 2004 and resulted in an insignificant loss. The
combined transactions resulted in a net gain of $2.8 million.

On June 14, 2004, Magruder’s Center in Rockville, Maryland, which was owned by one of our partnerships, was condemned by the City of Rockville in order to facilitate the redevelopment of the Rockville Town Center. We received $14.3
million in condemnation proceeds from the City of Rockville, resulting in a gain of $5.4 million.



In July 2004, at a contribution value of approximately $20.6 million, we contributed Plaza del Mercado to
a newly formed joint venture in exchange for a 30% ownership interest in the joint venture and $18.6 million of proceeds. The joint venture simultaneously financed the property with a $13.3 million 10-year secured loan. We recognized a gain of $0.1
million on this transaction.

On September 16, 2004 we sold 3.1
acres of land at the Village at Shirlington in Arlington, Virginia in two separate transactions for a total of $2.8 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million. The funds were used to pay down borrowings under our line of credit.

On September 30, 2004 we paid $2.3 million to purchase 10% of the partnership
interests in Street Retail West 6, LP, giving us 100% ownership of the property at 140-168 W. Colorado located in Pasadena, California.

On October 1, 2004 we paid $0.8 million to purchase 15% of the partnership interests in Street Retail Tempe I, LLC, giving us 100% ownership of 501 South
Mill located in Tempe, Arizona.

On October 12, 2004 we
purchased Shaw’s Plaza, located in Carver, Massachusetts, for $4.0 million.

On November 10, 2004 we issued 40,201 of our common shares to purchase 10% of the partnership interests in Street Retail West 10, LP, giving us 100% ownership of 214 Wilshire Boulevard, located in Santa Monica,
California.

On December 15, 2004 we sold one building in West
Hartford, Connecticut and two buildings in Avon, Connecticut for a total of $11.2 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $3.6 million.

On December 29, 2004 we sold one property in Evanston, Illinois for $4.0 million, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million.

2004 Financing Developments

On January 26, 2004, we issued $75 million of fixed rate notes, which mature
in February 2011 and bear interest at 4.50%. The proceeds of this note offering were used to pay down our revolving credit facility by $50 million and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes.

Also in January 2004, to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on
our $150 million term loan obtained in October 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap, which fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.401% through October 2006. The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 95 basis
points (0.95%). The interest rate on the term note was 2.1% as of December 31, 2003. The current interest rate, taking into account the swap, is 3.351% (2.401% plus 0.95%) on notional amounts totaling $150 million and is 2.95% without the swap.

We paid off our 6.74% Medium Term Notes on their due date of
March 10, 2004 for their full principal balance of $39.5 million plus accrued interest of $1.2 million.

On April 7, 2004, we issued 2.2 million common shares at a net price of $45.33 per share (after taking into account underwriters’ discount and
commissions) netting approximately $99 million in cash proceeds before other expenses of the offering. The proceeds were used to repay the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility that were drawn to acquire Westgate Mall and for
general corporate purposes.

Outlook

We believe that in 2005 we will experience growth in earnings from
operations when compared to 2004. We expect this growth in earnings to be generated by a combination of the following:

•

increased earnings in our same center portfolio,



•

increased earnings from our real estate partnership established in July 2004.

•

increased earnings as we expand our portfolio through property acquisitions,

•

increased earnings as a result of improved occupancy and rental rates on retail and/or residential space at Santana Row, and

Our earnings in 2003 and 2004 were positively impacted by the reimbursement
to us of lost rents of $11.0 million from an insurance settlement received in December 2003 related to a fire at Santana Row in 2002. Of the $11 million reimbursement, approximately $8 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2003 and
approximately $3 million was recognized during 2004.

Earnings
in our same center portfolio are anticipated to grow as a recovering economy in each of our regions is expected to result in improved occupancy rates and increasing rents on lease rollovers. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Same Center” below for the definition of the properties that constitute our “same center” portfolio. The economic environment in the Northern
California retail market, while improving, continues to be weak, resulting in lower occupancy rates and limiting our ability to increase rents in properties in that area. We believe the economies of our other markets are generally improving. Our
same center growth has also been slowed during the past two fiscal years by the increase in our redevelopment activity at certain centers, which will, by design, keep leasable space out of service until the redevelopments are complete. The
competitive retail environment has resulted in the loss of some of our anchor retailers, but we have been successful in replacing a number of those anchors and other weaker tenants with tenants that we believe are more credit worthy. In other cases,
we have taken advantage of the opportunity to redevelop the space that became vacant when the anchor tenant vacated. While this redevelopment and retenanting activity has resulted in increased capital investment in those centers, it should also
increase the rental income from new leases as these tenants commence operations, add to the economic life of the centers, and increase the appeal of the centers to retail customers. These factors should extend the number of years during which we can
reasonably expect growth in earnings from those properties beyond the period we would have expected if we had not made the additional capital investment.

The current development at Santana Row consists of four phases. Seven of the eight buildings of Phase I, which include retail, residential and a 213-room
hotel, opened in 2002. The retail portion of the remaining building, “Building 7,” opened in early 2003. The delay in opening Building 7 was the result of a fire in August 2002 that destroyed all but 11 of the planned 246 residential units
located on that building. The rebuilding of the residential rental units on Building 7 (Phase IV) commenced in 2004. We anticipate delivery of the units will start in 2005 and, when completed in 2006, Building 7 will add 96 townhomes and 160 flats.
Phase II of the project, which includes approximately 84,000 square feet of retail space, was completed in late 2003 and Phase III, which consists of an arts cinema and 4,000 square feet of retail space, opened in August 2004. The total cost of
Phase I is estimated to be $449 million (excluding the Building 7 reconstruction). The costs to date for Phase I are net of $129 million of insurance proceeds, $11 million of which was recognized as income in 2004 and 2003. The cost of Phase II is
approximately $27 million. The total cost of Phase III is estimated to be approximately $5 million, and we estimate the cost Phase IV, will be approximately $58 million. We are exploring in 2005 the possibility of selling as many as 219 residential
units at Santana as condominiums. In the event we determine it is financially feasible to sell residential units and we are able to obtain all necessary approvals, sales of units could begin in mid-2005.

The financial success of Santana Row will depend on many factors, which
cannot be assured. These factors include, among others:

•

the demand for retail and residential space,

•

the ongoing cost of operations and maintenance,



•

the costs of ongoing and future developments, and

•

the general economy, particularly around Silicon Valley.

We anticipate further growth in earnings from continuing investments in our primary markets in the East and West regions, partly offset by selective
dispositions. We expect to continue growth through acquisition of neighborhood and community shopping centers in 2005 and beyond. This growth is contingent, however, on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative hurdles at prices that
meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates also may affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price which must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to finance the property
acquisitions.

As one method of enhancing our growth and
strengthening our market share in the regions in which we operate, in July 2004, we entered into a joint venture arrangement by forming a limited partnership in which we own 30% of the equity. The venture intends to acquire up to $350 million of
stabilized, supermarket-anchored shopping centers in our East coast and West coast markets which will be financed through secured borrowings and equity contributions. We will be the manager of the venture and its properties, earning fees for
acquisitions, management, leasing and financing. Through our partnership interest, we also will have the opportunity to earn performance-based income.

Results of Operations

Same Center

Throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a “same center” basis. Information provided on a same center basis is provided for only those properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods
being compared and includes properties, for which redevelopment or expansion had been completed prior to the beginning of either of the periods being compared. Properties purchased or sold and properties under development at any time during the
periods being compared are excluded.

Our same center-basis
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 exclude the four properties acquired in 2004 and the five properties acquired in 2003, respectively including Westgate Mall, Shaw’s Plaza,
Mount Vernon Plaza, South Valley Shopping Center, Plaza del Mercado and Mercer Mall as well as the eight and ten dispositions in 2004 and 2003, respectively including Magruder’s Center, Plaza del Mercado and other properties. We also exclude
properties under development in 2004 or 2003, primarily Santana Row.

On a same center basis, results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 excludes the 10 properties sold in 2003 and the six properties sold in 2002. It also excludes properties under
development in 2003 and 2002, including Pentagon Row and Santana Row.



YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

PROPERTY REVENUES

Total revenues in 2004 were $394.3 million which
represents an increase of $41.7 million, or 11.8%, over total revenues of $352.6 million in 2003. The primary drivers of this increase are acquisitions, Santana Row, which was phased into service, and an increase in same center revenues as a result
of increased occupancy and increased rental revenue on tenant rollovers as detailed below. In addition, we experienced increased cost recoveries from our tenants attributable to higher operating costs at the properties.

The percentage leased at our shopping centers increased to 95.1% at December
31, 2004 compared to 93.1% at year-end 2003 due primarily to new leases signed at existing properties.

Rental income

. Rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, percentage rent and cost recoveries from tenants of common area maintenance costs
and real estate taxes. Rental income increased $33.8 million, or 10.0%, in 2004 versus $338.1 million in 2003 due largely to the following:

•

an increase of approximately $31.2 million due to the six properties acquired in 2004 and 2003 and from Santana Row,

•

on a same center basis, an increase of $7.6 million, or approximately 2.5%, due mainly to increased minimum rents associated with tenant rollovers and redevelopments, partially
offset by

•

approximately $5.0 million less income recognized on the Santana Row fire insurance settlement.



Other Property Income.

Other property income increased $7.1 million, or 68.2%, to $17.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in other property income are items which, although recurring, tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period, such as
lease termination fees and temporary tenant income. The increase in other property income in 2004 is primarily the result of higher lease termination fees, parking revenue and income from our restaurant joint ventures.

Mortgage Interest Income.

Interest on mortgage notes receivable
increased $0.8 million, or 19.8%, to $4.9 million 2004 versus $4.1 million in 2003 due to higher principal balances on notes outstanding.

PROPERTY EXPENSES

Total property operating expenses were $129.9 million in 2004, which represents an increase of $13.5 million, or 11.6%, when compared to $116.4 million in
2003. The increase in total expenses is due primarily to increased real estate tax assessments, utility and maintenance costs and other operating costs incurred during 2004 as detailed below.

Rental Expense.

Rental expense increased $9.3 million, or 11.3%, to
$91.6 million in 2004 from $82.3 million in 2003. Of this increase,

•

an increase in rental expenses at centers acquired during 2003 and 2004 of $4.1 million,

•

an increase of $2.9 million due mostly to reserves related to mortgage notes receivable,

•

on a same center basis, rental expenses increased $1.5 million, or 2.3%, to $65.6 million due to increases in utility and other and administrative operating costs, and

•

an increase of $0.8 million at development properties due to lower capitalized costs and increased utility expense, partly offset by reduced marketing costs.

As a result of these changes in rental expenses,
rental income and other property income, rental expense as a percentage of rental income plus other property income decreased from 23.6% in 2003 to 23.5% in 2004.

Real Estate Taxes.

Real estate tax expense rose $4.2 million, or 12.2% to $38.3 million in 2004 compared to $34.1
million in 2003. The increase in 2004 is due largely to increased taxes of $2.8 million related to acquired and developed properties, including Santana Row, and higher tax assessments for our properties in the East.

Property Operating Income.

Property operating income was $264.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $28.2 million, or 11.9% compared to $236.2 million in 2003. Income recognized from fire insurance proceeds attributable to rental income lost at Santana Row due to the August, 2002 fire
amounted to approximately $3.0 million and $8.0 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding these proceeds, property operating income rose $33.1 million. This increase is due primarily to:

•

earnings growth at Santana Row for the phases which was phased into service,

•

earnings resulting from our acquisitions of additional properties, and

•

same center earnings increases.

Same center property operating income rose 4.3%, or approximately $9.4 million, in 2004. This increase is primarily due to:

•

increased rental income associated with tenant rollovers, other income, and

•

higher real estate tax recoveries, partly offset by

•

property operating expenses which increased more than the related recoveries.



Interest Expense

. Interest expense rose $9.8 million, or 13.1%, to $85.1 million in 2004 compared
to $75.3 million in 2003. This increase is almost entirely due to lower capitalization of interest and therefore higher interest expense as most of our property under development, particularly at Santana Row, has been placed into service. Gross
interest costs in 2004 were $90.2 million versus $88.7 million in 2003. Capitalized interest amounted to $5.1 million and $13.5 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

General and Administrative Expense.

Administrative expenses increased by $6.3 million, or 53.7%, to $18.2 million in
2004 compared to $11.8 million in 2003. This increase resulted primarily from costs of personnel and compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Expenses attributable to depreciation and amortization rose $15.2 million or 20.5% to $89.7 million in 2004 from
$74.5 million in 2003. The increase is due to depreciation on developments, same center increases and on new properties acquired.

OTHER

Minority Interests

. Income to minority owners decreased $0.5 million, or 10.7% to $4.2 million in 2004 from $4.7 million in 2003. This is the
result of increased earnings at properties owned in partnership offset by a decrease in the ownership percentage of several partnerships held by minority owners.

Operating Income from Discontinued Operations.

Operating income from discontinued operations represents the operating
income of properties that have been disposed of which, under SFAS No. 144, are required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations. The reported operating income of $1.1 million and $3.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively,
represent the operating income for the period during which we owned the eight properties sold in 2004 and the ten properties sold in 2003.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate.

The gain on sale of real estate in 2004 decreased $6.0 million, or 29.9%, to $14.0 million from $20.0 million in 2003.
None of the eight and ten properties sold in 2004 and 2003, respectively resulted in a loss.



YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002

PROPERTY REVENUES

Total revenues in 2003 were $352.6 million which
represents an increase of $42.5 million, or 13.7%, over total revenues of $310.1 million in 2002. The primary drivers of this increase are Santana Row, which has been phased into service, acquisitions, an increase in same center revenues from higher
rent on tenant rollovers as detailed below and income of approximately $8.0 million from the portion of the settlement of our insurance claims for the August 2002 fire at Santana Row related to lost rent. In addition, we experienced increased cost
recoveries related to higher operating costs.

The percentage
leased at our shopping centers declined to 93.1% at December 31, 2003 compared to 94.7% at year end 2002 due to the acquisition of centers with lower occupancy rates and the bankruptcies of several large tenants (including K-mart and Today’s
Man) as well as an increase in redevelopment activity which results in leaseable space being taken out of service for more extended periods.

Rental Income

. Rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, percentage rent and cost recoveries from tenants of common area maintenance costs
and real estate taxes. Rental income increased $42.3 million, or 14.3%, in 2003 versus 2002 due largely to the following:

•

an increase of approximately $22.0 million due to properties acquired in 2003 and from Santana Row, which was considered to be under development,



•

on a same center basis, an increase of over $12.3 million, or approximately 4.5%, due mainly to increased minimum rents associated with tenant rollovers and developments, and
increased tenant recovery income, and

•

approximately $8.0 million from the Santana Row fire insurance settlement.

Other Property Income.

Other property income decreased $0.2 million, or 1.5%, to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to
$10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in other property income are items, which although recurring, tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period, such as lease termination fees and temporary tenant income.
The decrease in other property income in 2003 is primarily the result of higher temporary tenant income offset by lower lease termination fees.

Mortgage Interest Income.

Mortgage interest income increased $0.3 million, or 8.8%, in 2004 verses 2003.

PROPERTY EXPENSES

Total property operating expenses in 2003 were $116.4 million, or an increase
of $14.4 million when compared to $102.0 million in 2002. The total increase in expenses is due primarily to higher real estate taxes, increased maintenance costs related to snow removal in 2003 and the impact of acquisitions and developments as
detailed below.

Rental Expense.

Rental expense
increased $10.5 million, or 14.7%, to $82.3 million in 2003 from $71.8 million in 2002. Of this increase,

•

rental expenses at centers acquired and developed during 2003 (including Santana Row) increased $8.3 million, and

•

snow removal costs increased approximately $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2003 and other maintenance and rental expenses, on a same center basis, were reduced approximately
$1.7 million.

Rental expense reductions related
to disposed properties were not significant.

As a result of
these changes in rental expenses, rental income and other property income, rental expense as a percentage of rental income plus other property income increased slightly from 23.4% in 2002 to 23.6% in 2003.

Real Estate Taxes.

Real estate tax expense rose 12.9% in 2003 to $34.1
million compared to $30.2 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 is due largely to higher tax assessments for our properties in the East as well as increased taxes of $1.8 million related to acquired and developed properties, including Santana Row,
which was brought into service starting in late 2002.

Property Operating Income.

Property operating income was $236.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $28.1 million compared to $208.1 million in 2003. Of this amount approximately $8.0 million relates to the
Santana Row fire insurance proceeds attributable to rental income lost as a result of the fire. Excluding these proceeds, property operating income rose $20.1 million during 2004 due primarily to:

•

earnings growth at Santana Row which has been phased into service,

•

same center earnings increases, and

•

earnings resulting from our acquisitions.

Same center property operating income rose 13.5% or $28.1 million in 2003 due to increased rental income associated with tenant rollovers and higher real
estate tax recoveries and reduced property administrative expenses partly offset by property expenses which rose higher than the related recoveries, particularly the snow removal costs.



Interest Expense

. Interest expense rose $10.2 million, or 15.7%, to $75.2 million in 2003. This
increase is almost entirely due to lower capitalization of interest and therefore higher interest expense as much of our property under development, particularly at Santana Row, was placed into service. Gross interest costs in 2003 was $88.7 million
versus $88.6 million in 2002. Capitalized interest amounted to $13.5 million and $23.5 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

General and Administrative Expense.

Administrative expenses decreased by $2.0 million during 2003, or 14.3% to $11.8 million compared to $13.8
million in 2002. This $2.0 million decrease resulted primarily from payroll and related benefits savings resulting from the management restructuring which began in February 2002. In addition, we experienced savings in legal costs and costs to
support and maintain our information systems. These savings were largely offset by increased expensing of costs which had previously had been capitalized related to personnel involved in the development of Santana Row.

Restructuring Expense.

The restructuring expenses incurred in 2002
related to our adoption of a new business and management succession plan and resulted in a charge of $8.5 million, all of which was expended in 2002. In December 2002, we recorded a charge of $13.8 million as a result of an accelerated executive
transition plan of which $12.7 million was expended in 2003.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Expenses attributable to depreciation and amortization rose $11.3 million to $74.5 million in 2003 from $63.2 million in 2002, an increase of 17.9%. The increase is due to depreciation on properties
which were acquired in 2003 as well as depreciation of Santana Row which opened in late 2002, and Pentagon Row, which came fully into service during 2002.

OTHER

Minority Interests

. The increase in income to minority interests of $0.6 million from $4.1 million in 2002 to $4.7 million in 2003 is the result of
increased earnings at properties owned in partnership as well as an increase in the number of operating partnership units held by minority investors. Units which were issued in connection with our acquisition of Mount Vernon Shopping Center were
partially offset by a decrease in units outstanding as a results of redemptions during the year.

Operating Income from Discontinued Operations.

Operating income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that
have been disposed of which, under SFAS No. 144, are required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations. The reported operating income of $3.2 million and $4.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, represent the operating income
for the period during which we owned the ten properties sold in 2003 and the six properties sold in 2002.

Loss on Abandoned Developments and Gain on Sale of Real Estate.

The gain on sale of real estate in 2003 was $20.1 million from the disposal of
properties. None of the properties sold in 2003 resulted in a loss. The gain in 2002 of $19.1 million is the result of the sale of six properties. The loss on abandoned developments in 2002 resulted from our change in business plan.

Segment Results

We operate our business on an asset management model, where property management teams are responsible for a portfolio of
assets. Prior to June 30, 2004, we divided our portfolio of properties into three operating regions: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and West.

Beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2004, we determined that our portfolio should be divided into two operating regions, rather than
three. Property management teams consisting of regional directors, leasing agents, development staff and financial personnel each have responsibility for a distinct portfolio. The two regions into which we have divided our portfolio of properties
are: East and West. As a result, our segment information for prior periods has been recalculated by combining our Northeast and Mid-Atlantic segments into the new East region.



The following selected key segment data presented is for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, except total assets and gross leasable area which are presented as of December 31 of each year. The results of operations of properties that have been sold during the period from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004 are excluded from
property operating income data in the following table, in accordance with SFAS No. 144.

Property operating income consists of rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes. The measure is used internally to evaluate the performance of our
regional operations, and we consider it to be a significant measure.

EAST

The East region extends roughly from New England south through
metropolitan Washington, D.C. and further south through Virginia and North Carolina. This region also includes several properties in Florida, Illinois, and Michigan. As of December 31, 2004, the East segment consisted of 72 properties.

•

Total revenue in the East increased $19.0 million to $303.2 million in 2004 compared to $284.2 million in 2003. The increase in total revenue of 6.7% is attributable mainly to an
increase in same center revenues of $9.8 million, an increase of $8.1 million from acquisitions and an increase of $1.0 million from other income. Total revenue in the East increased $12.5 million, or 4.6% to $284.2 million in 2003 compared to
$271.7 million in 2002. The increase in 2003 relates primarily to increased rental revenue of $7.9 million revenue and recoveries from our existing portfolio and an increase of $4.6 million from acquisitions.

•

The percentage leased was 96%, 94% and 96% at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The percentage leased increased between 2003 and 2004 due partly to centers under
redevelopment becoming leased and increased occupancy at Mercer Mall, South Valley Shopping Center and Mount Vernon Mall. The percentage of our East region properties leased decreased between 2002 and 2003 primarily as a result of our acquisitions
of Mercer Mall, South Valley Shopping Center and Mount Vernon Mall in late 2003, as these properties had lower occupancy rates than our existing portfolio.

The ratio of property operating income to total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased slightly from the
same period of 2003 due mainly to increased rental revenues and cost recoveries being more than offset by increased operating expenses, primarily real estate tax expense. The ratio of property operating



income to total rental income during the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased slightly from the same period of 2002 due mainly to a lower recovery rate on
higher common area expenses, particularly due to the snow removal costs incurred in the first quarter of 2003.

WEST

The West region extends from Texas to the West Coast. As of December 31, 2004, 35 of our properties, including Santana Row, were located in the West region.

Total revenue in the West in 2004 increased $22.8 million to $91.1 million compared to $68.3 million in 2003. The increase
in total revenue of 33.3% is largely attributable to increased rental revenue of $16.7 million, primarily at Santana Row and from our acquisition of Westgate Mall, and to increased other income, including termination fees, of $6.1 million. The
increase in rental revenue was partially offset by a decrease in insurance proceeds of approximately $5.0 million. The insurance proceeds were reported as part of rental income as they relate largely to lost rents on the delayed opening of the
residential and retail units and rental concessions to tenants due to the August 2002 fire at Santana Row.

Total revenue in the West in 2003 increased $30.0 million, or 78.2%, to $68.3 million compared to $38.3 million in 2002. The increase in total revenue is
largely attributable to increased total revenues at Santana Row of approximately $21.3 million. In addition, approximately $8.0 million of the rental income from the insurance proceeds received related to the fire at Santana Row was recorded in
2003. Excluding the Santana Row revenue growth and the insurance proceeds, total revenue growth in 2003 was 4% as higher income in San Antonio, Texas and southern California more than offset lower revenue at our property at 150 Post Street in San
Francisco, California.

For the West region, the percentage
leased was 93%, 88% and 84% at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Santana Row development added approximately 558,000 square feet of retail space to the West region since the end of 2001. The improved occupancy as of year-end 2004
compared to the end of 2003 is due largely to the acquisition of Westgate Mall and the leasing of additional space at Santana Row. The improved occupancy as of year-end 2003 compared to the end of 2002 is due largely to increases at Santana Row and
Houston Street in San Antonio, Texas.

The West region’s
property operating income margin to total revenue improved in 2004 over 2003 due primarily to growth in revenue at Santana Row and the acquisition of Westgate Mall. In 2003, we incurred a full year of operating expenses but rental revenues continued
to grow as occupancy increased at this project. The West’s property operating income margin increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due increased revenues at Santana Row and decreased operating expenses resulting from leasing, marketing and other
start-up activities related to the opening of Santana Row. The success of Santana Row and Houston Street in San Antonio, Texas will depend on many factors which are not entirely within our control. We monitor current and long-term economic forecasts
for these markets in order to evaluate the long-term financial returns of these projects. The overall return on investment in the West segment significantly lags the East due to a generally lower basis in our East properties related to their earlier
acquisition and to the phasing into service of Santana Row and Houston Street. We expect that the returns on investment in the West will continue to rise as these projects come into service but not necessarily to the same level of overall returns as
generated in the other segments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Due to the nature of our business and strategy, we
generally generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Our status as a REIT requires that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income each year, as defined in



the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, cash needed to execute our strategy and invest in new properties, as well as to pay our debt at maturity, must come
from one or more of the following sources:

•

cash not distributed to shareholders,

•

proceeds of property dispositions, or

•

proceeds derived from the issuance of new debt or equity securities.

It is management’s intention that we continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business. As a result, we
intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. We may, from time to time,
seek to obtain funds by the following means:

•

additional equity offerings,

•

unsecured debt financing and/or mortgage financings, and

•

other debt and equity alternatives, including formation of joint ventures, in a manner consistent with our intention to operate with a conservative debt structure.

Cash and cash equivalents were $30.5 million and
$35.0 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.

Summary of Cash Flows

The cash provided by
operating activities is primarily attributable to the operation of our properties and the change in working capital related to our operations.

We used cash of $154.3 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 in investing activities, including the following:

•

$101.7 million for our acquisition of Westgate Mall, Shaw’s Plaza and several parcels of land,

•

capital expenditures of $59.2 million for development and redevelopment of properties including Santana Row,

•

maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $36.9 million,

•

$9.4 million capital contribution to a real estate partnership, and

•

an additional $3.2 million net advance under an existing mortgage note receivable;

offset by

•

$41.8 million in net sale proceeds from the sale of properties, and



•

$14.3 million of net proceeds from the condemnation of Magruder’s Center.

Our financing activities used $11.3 million of cash, which was composed of:

•

$117.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares on April 7, 2004 and upon the exercise of options,

•

$75.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of notes payable;

offset by

•

$108.8 million used to pay dividends,

•

$48.4 million of net payments on our revolving credit facility,

•

$39.5 million used to pay off Medium Term Notes, and

•

$7.4 million representing the change in minority interests, relating to the buyouts of various operating partnership units.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

. Other than the joint venture described
in the next paragraph and items disclosed in the Contractual Commitments Table below, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2004 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

In July 2004, we entered into a joint venture arrangement by forming a limited partnership with affiliates of Clarion Lion Properties Fund
(“Clarion”), a discretionary fund created and advised by ING Clarion Partners. We own 30% of the equity in the partnership, and Clarion owns 70%. The partnership plans to acquire up to $350 million of stabilized, supermarket-anchored,
shopping centers in the Trust’s East and West regions. Federal Realty and Clarion have committed to contribute to the partnership up to $42 million and $98 million, respectively, of equity capital to acquire properties through June 2006.
Initially Clarion contributed $5.3 million in cash to the partnership, and we contributed Plaza del Mercado, a shopping center in Montgomery County, Maryland, which we acquired in 2003, at a contribution value of approximately $20.6 million.
Concurrently with the contribution of Plaza del Mercado, the partnership obtained a $13.3 million, 10-year loan secured by the property, and we received proceeds of $18.6 million. We are the manager of the partnership and its properties, earning
fees for acquisitions, management, leasing, and financing. We also have the opportunity to receive performance-based earnings through our partnership interest. In 2004 the venture acquired three shopping centers in the East for $55.2 million. We
account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method. In total, at December 31, 2004, the partnership had $47.2 million of mortgage notes outstanding.

Contractual Commitments

The following table provides a summary of our fixed, noncancelable obligations as of December 31, 2004:

In addition to the
amounts set forth in the table above, the following potential commitments exist:

(a) Under the terms of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement, from and after January 1, 1986, an unaffiliated third party has the
right to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between one-



half to all of its 29.47% interest in Congressional Plaza at the interest’s then-current fair market value. Based on management’s current estimate
of fair market value as of December 31, 2004, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $34 million to $38 million.

(b) Under the terms of two other partnerships which own properties in southern California with a cost of
approximately $29 million, if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships, the other partners may require us to purchase their partnership interests at a formula price based upon property operating
income. The purchase price for one of the partnerships will be paid in cash and the purchase price for the other partnership will be paid using a limited number of our common shares or, subject to certain conditions, cash. In those partnerships, if
the other partners do not redeem their interests, we may choose to purchase the limited partnership interests upon the same terms.

(c) Street Retail San Antonio LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Trust, entered into a Development Agreement (the “Agreement”)
in 2000 with the City of San Antonio, Texas (the “City”) related to the redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along Houston Street. Under the Agreement, we are required to issue an annual letter of credit, commencing on October
1, 2002 and ending on September 30, 2014, that covers our designated portion of the debt service should the incremental tax revenue generated in the area specified in the Agreement, or the Zone not cover the debt service. We posted a letter of
credit with the City on September 25, 2002 for $795,000, and the letter of credit remains outstanding. Our obligation under the Agreement is estimated to range from $1.6 million to $3.0 million. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 we
funded approximately $434,000 and $360,000, respectively. In anticipation of a shortfall of incremental tax revenues to the City, we have accrued $700,000 as of December 31, 2004 to cover additional payments we may be obligated to make as part of
the project costs. Prior to the expiration of the Agreement on September 30, 2014, we could be required to provide funding beyond the $700,000 currently accrued. We do not anticipate, however, that our obligation would exceed $600,000 in any year or
$3 million in total. If the Zone creates sufficient tax increment funding to repay the City’s debt prior to the expiration of the Agreement, we will be eligible to receive reimbursement of amounts paid for debt service shortfalls together with
interest thereon.

(d) Under the terms of
various other partnerships, which own shopping center properties with a cost of approximately $88.5 million, including one of the two shopping centers purchased in the first quarter of 2003, the partners have the right to exchange their operating
units for cash or the same number of our common shares, at our option. In 2004 we paid $399,000 to redeem 9,767 of these operating units and issued 203,130 of our common shares to redeem the same amount of operating units.

On September 27, 2004, we issued 190,000 of our common shares valued at $8.6
million to a subsidiary. The shares have been pledged to secure a note in the amount of $8.6 million, which was issued in connection with the redemption by that subsidiary of certain of its outstanding limited partnership interests. The shares were
issued in a private offering in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. On February 1, 2004 the shares were sold. The proceeds from the sale
were used to repay the $8.6 million note in full.

As of
December 31, 2004, a total of 449,325 operating units are outstanding.

(e) A master lease for Mercer Mall includes a fixed purchase option for $55 million in 2023. If we fail to exercise our purchase option, the owner of Mercer Mall has a put option which would require us to purchase
Mercer Mall for $60 million in 2025.

(f) In
addition to our contractual obligations, we have other short-term liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal recurring operating expenses, regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional and replacement
debt), recurring corporate expenditures including compensation agreements, non-recurring corporate expenditures (such as tenant improvements and redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. In addition, future rental
commitments are not reflected as commitments until the underlying leased space has been delivered for use. Overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties
and the timing and cost of future phases of Santana Row.



Debt Financing Arrangements

As of December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of $1.3 billion.

The following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of December 31,
2004:

1)

Mortgage loans do not include the Trust’s 30% share ($14.2 million) of the $47.2 million debt of the partnership with Clarion Lion Properties Fund.

2)

The interest rate is fixed at 5.66% for the first ten years and then will be reset to a market rate. The lender has the option to call the loan on April 15, 2013 or any time
thereafter.

3)

The maximum amount drawn under the facility during the first twelve months of 2004 was $165 million. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the
facility for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was 2.2%.



4)

This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. In January 2004, we purchased interest rate swaps or hedges on this note, which fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate
at 2.401% through October 2006, resulting in an effective interest rate, assuming no change to our debt rating, of 3.351% through October 2006.

5)

The bonds require monthly interest only payments through maturity. The bonds bear interest at a variable rate determined weekly to be the interest rate, which would enable the bonds
to be remarketed at 100% of their principal amount. The weighted average interest rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was 2.71%. The property is not encumbered by a lien.

6)

The note requires interest on the principal balance at the Applicable Federal Rate established by the Internal Revenue Service for short-term debt instruments for the month of
September 2004. This note was paid in full February 1, 2005.

7)

We purchased interest rate swaps at issuance (in 1998), thereby reducing the effective interest rate from 6.99% to 6.894%.

8)

We purchased an interest rate lock to hedge a planned note offering. A hedge loss of $1.5 million associated with this hedge is being amortized into the note offering, thereby
increasing the effective interest rate on these notes to 6.325%.

9)

Beginning on August 15, 2008, the debentures are redeemable by the holders thereof at the original purchase price of $1,000 per debenture.

10)

Beginning on August 1, 2007, the notes are redeemable by the holders thereof at the original purchase price of $1,000 per note.

Our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial covenants
that may limit our operating activities in the future. These covenants require us to comply with a number of financial provisions using calculations of ratios and other amounts that are not normally useful to a financial statement reader and that
are calculated in a manner that is not in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the numeric information set forth below is calculated as required by our various loan agreements rather than in accordance with GAAP. We have not included a reconciliation
of this information to GAAP information because, in this case, there is no directly comparable GAAP measure, similarly titled GAAP measures are not relevant in determining whether or not we are in compliance with our financial covenants and we
believe that the ratios on our material covenants are relevant to the reader. These covenants require us to:

•

limit the amount of debt so that our interest and other fixed charge coverage will exceed 1.75 to 1 (we maintained a ratio of 2.19 to 1 as of December 31, 2004);

•

limit the amount of debt as a percentage of total asset value to less than 0.55 to 1 (we maintained a ratio of 0.454 to 1 as of December 31, 2004);

•

limit the amount of secured debt as a percentage of total asset value to less than 0.30 to 1 (we maintained a ratio of 0.15 to 1 as of December 31, 2004);

•

limit the amount of unsecured debt so that unencumbered asset value to unsecured debt will equal or exceed 1.75 to 1 (we maintained a ratio of 2.65 to 1 as of December 31, 2004);
and

•

limit the total cost of development projects under construction to 15% or less of gross asset value (the budgeted total cost of our projects under construction at December 31, 2004
represented 2.8% of gross asset value).

We are
also obligated to comply with other covenants, including, among others, provisions:

•

relating to the maintenance of any property securing a mortgage;

•

restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;

•

restricting our ability to incur additional debt;

•

restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage;

•

restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and

•

restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants. If we were to breach any of our debt
covenants, including the listed covenants, and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession
of the property securing the loan. Many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt



arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt
obligations. As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.

Below are the aggregate principal payments required as of December 31, 2004
under our debt financing arrangements by year. Scheduled principal installments and amounts due at maturity are included.

(1)

Includes $55 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

(2)

Includes $13.1 million under the Mount Vernon mortgage loan that may be required to be paid on or after April 15, 2013 and $90 million of unsecured debt that may be called by the
holders beginning August 1, 2007 as to $40 million thereof and beginning August 15, 2008 as to $50 million thereof.

Our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur.

Interest Rate Hedging

We enter into derivative contracts, which qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”, in order to manage interest rate risk. Derivatives are not purchased for speculation. We use derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to manage our fixed to variable
rate debt ratio. As of September 30, 2004, the Company had three cash flow hedge agreements, which are accounted for in conformity with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS No.
138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities—an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.”

In January 2004, to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our $150 million, five-year term loan issued in October 2003, we entered into an
interest rate swap, which fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.401% through October 2006. The interest rate on the term loan as of December 31, 2003 was 2.1% based on LIBOR plus 95 basis points. Upon entering into the
swap, the interest rate was fixed, assuming no change to our debt rating, at 3.351% on notional amounts totaling $150 million through October 2006. On the January 2004 hedge, we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the
counterparty to the interest rate protection agreement should interest rates exceed the cap. However, management does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. The counterparty has a long-term debt rating of “A” by Standard and
Poor’s Ratings Service and “A1” by Moody’s Investors Service as of December 31, 2004. Although our swap is not exchange traded, there are a number of financial institutions which enter into these types of transactions as part of
their day-to-day activities. The swap has been documented as a cash flow hedge and designated as effective at inception of the swap contract. Consequently, the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swap at its fair value is recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity and either a derivative instrument asset or liability is recorded on the balance sheet.

The two remaining hedging instruments involved an interest rate swap associated with our 6.99% Medium Term Notes and an interest rate lock purchased in
2002 in connection with our 6.125% Notes and are described in more detail in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk – Interest Rate Hedging.”



Liquidity Requirements

Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases, normal recurring operating expenses,
regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt, as well as scheduled debt maturities), recurring trust expenditures, non-recurring trust expenditures (such as tenant improvements and
redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. Overall capital requirements in 2004 and 2005 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost
of future phases of Santana Row. To the extent that we require additional funds to meet our capital requirements, and normal recurring operating costs, we expect to fund these amounts from one or more of the following sources:

•

cash provided by operating activities,

•

borrowings under our credit facility,

•

additional and replacement borrowings, both secured and unsecured, from other funding sources, and

•

additional equity financing.

Our long-term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our long-term debt, development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisition
opportunities. We expect to fund these through a combination of sources which we believe will be available to us, including additional and replacement secured and unsecured borrowings, issuance of additional equity, joint venture relationships
relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions.

The following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements:

•

we may be unable to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, as a result of our financial condition or market conditions at the time we seek additional
financing;

•

restrictions in our debt instruments or outstanding equity may prohibit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at all, or on acceptable terms under then-prevailing market
conditions; and

•

we may be unable to service additional or replacement debt due to increases in interest rates or a decline in our operating performance.

REIT Qualification

We intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be
subject to corporate federal income taxes as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the Code, including the requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders.

Funds From Operations

Funds FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance NAREIT defines
FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with the U.S. GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains on the sale of real estate. We compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT
definition, and we have historically reported our FFO available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. It should be noted that FFO:

•

does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the
determination of net income);

•

should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and

•

is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.



We consider FFO available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating
performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of GAAP and the recording of depreciation. We use FFO primarily as one
of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other REITs. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the
application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.

An
increase or decrease in FFO available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our Board of Trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless
necessary for us to maintain REIT status. However, we must distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income (as defined in the Code) to remain qualified as a REIT. Therefore, a significant increase in FFO will generally require an increase in distributions
to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis.

The reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows:

Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Mark

et Risk

Our use of financial
instruments, such as debt instruments, subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows, as well as the fair value of our assets. Market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and
market prices. We manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating, investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments, dividends to common and preferred shareholders,
investments, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. We also enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk. We use interest rate protection and swap agreements, for example, to convert
some of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. We use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

The following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for variable rate
debt and on the fair value of total outstanding debt, including our fixed-rate debt. Interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. This analysis does not purport to take into account all
of the factors that may affect our debt, such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management likely would take to reduce our exposure to the change. This
analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.

Fixed Interest Rate Debt

. The majority of our outstanding debt obligations (maturing at various times through 2028 or through 2077 including capital lease obligations) have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of



fluctuating interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments, however. At December 31, 2004 we had
$1.1 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding. If interest rates on our fixed-rate debt instruments at December 31, 2004 had been 1.0% higher, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately $11.4 million.
If interest rates on our fixed-rate debt instruments at December 31, 2004 had been 1.0% lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately $11.4 million.

Variable Interest Rate Debt

. We believe that our primary interest rate
risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2004, we had $164.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding. Based upon this balance of variable rate debt, if interest rates increased 1.0%, our interest
expense would increase by approximately $1.6 million, and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately $1.6 million. If interest rates decreased 1.0%, our interest expense would decrease by approximately $1.6 million,
and our net income and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately $1.6 million.

Interest Rate Hedging

Our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. We use derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of our variable rate
debt to fixed rate debt and to manage our fixed to variable rate debt ratio.

Cash Flow Hedging

. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the payment
of fixed rate amounts in exchange for variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. During the year ended December 31, 2004, these derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows
associated with existing variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had entered into three cash flow hedge agreements, which are accounted for in conformity with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended by SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.”

A more detailed description of these derivative financial instruments is contained in “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Interest Rate Hedging.”

Hedging of Unsecured Notes

. We have entered into several interest rate swaps or interest rate locks that hedged certain unsecured notes. In January
2004, to hedge our exposure to interest rates on the $150 million five-year term loan, we entered into an interest rate swap, which fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.401% through October 2006. The interest rate on
the term loan as of December 31, 2003 was 2.1% based on LIBOR plus 95 basis points. The current interest rate, taking into account the swap, is 3.351% (2.401% plus 0.95%) on notional amounts totaling $150 million.

In anticipation of a $150 million Senior Unsecured Note offering, on August
1, 2002, we entered into a treasury lock that fixed the benchmark five year treasury rate at 3.472% through August 19, 2002. The rate lock was documented as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction and designated as effective at the inception
of the contract. On August 16, 2002, we priced the Senior Unsecured Notes with a scheduled closing date of August 21, 2002 and closed out the associated rate lock. Five-year treasury rates declined between the pricing period and the settlement of
the hedge purchase; therefore, to settle the rate lock, we paid $1.5 million. As a result of the August 19, 2002 fire at Santana Row, we were not able to proceed with the note offering at that time. However, we consummated a $150 million Senior
Unsecured Note offering on November 15, 2002, and thus, the hedge loss is being amortized into interest expense over the life of the related Notes.

We also purchased an interest rate swap with a face amount of $40.5 million upon issuance of our 6.99% Medium Term Notes, which reduced the effective
interest rate from 6.99% to 6.894%.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Controls

Trustees and shareholders of Federal Realty Investment Trust

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Assessment Report on Internal Controls, that Federal Realty Investment Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) and
subsidiaries (the Trust) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Trust’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

An organization’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An organization’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the organization; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the organization are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the organization; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the organization’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also in our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of the Trust and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, and our report dated March 2, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Management Assessment Report on Internal Controls

The management of Federal Realty is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, our President and Chief Executive officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, and effected by our employees, including management and our board of trustees, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This process includes policies and
procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets in reasonable detail;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorization procedures we have established; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of any of our assets in circumstances that could have a
material adverse effect on our financial statements.

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating our control system, management
recognized that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, that may affect our operation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and
that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management’s override of the control. The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Trust’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework.

Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria, as of the end of our most recent fiscal year.

Federal Realty’s independent registered public accounting firm have
issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page F-1.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Trustees and Shareholders of Federal Realty Investment Trust

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Federal Realty Investment Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) and subsidiaries (the Trust) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Federal
Realty Investment Trust and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Our audits were
conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The Schedules III and IV are presented for the purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic consolidated
financial statements. These schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO

NOTE 1

. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Federal Realty Investment Trust (the “Trust”) is an
equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership, management, development and redevelopment of high quality community and neighborhood shopping centers and main street mixed-use properties located primarily in densely developed
urban and suburban areas in strategic metropolitan markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions and California.

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. A trust which distributes at
least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Therefore, federal
income taxes have been and are generally expected to be immaterial. We are obligated to pay state taxes, generally consisting of franchise or gross receipts taxes in certain states. Such state taxes have not been material.

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust, its
corporate subsidiaries, and numerous partnerships and limited liability companies, which we control. The equity interests of other investors are reflected as “minority interests.” All significant intercompany transactions and balances are
eliminated in consolidation. We account for our interests in joint ventures, which we do not control or manage, using the equity method of accounting.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as
“GAAP,” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates
are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past, current and expected events and economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

. Our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Minimum
rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit, collection and other business risk. Percentage rents, which represent additional rents
based on gross tenant sales, are recognized at the end of the lease year or other period in which we have determined that tenants sales’ thresholds have been reached and the percentage rents are collectible. Real estate tax and other cost
reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the expenditures occurred. We make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to base rents, including straight line rentals, expense reimbursements
and other revenue or income. In some cases the ultimate collectibility of these claims extends beyond one year. We generally do not recognize income from straight-line rents due beyond ten years due to uncertainty of collection. At December 31, 2004
and December 31, 2003 our allowance for doubtful accounts was $7.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively.

Real Estate

. Land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.
Estimated useful lives range generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant work and other major improvements are capitalized and depreciated
over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, respectively. Upon termination of a lease, undepreciated tenant improvement costs are charged to operations if the assets are replaced and the asset and the corresponding accumulated
depreciation are retired. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15 years. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 66,
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”, sales are recognized at closing only when sufficient down payments have

F-8


been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and we have no significant continuing involvement. The gain or
loss resulting from the sale of properties is included in net income at the time of sale.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations” our methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is based on estimated fair values, replacement cost and appraised values. When we acquire operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated to land and buildings, intangibles such as values of individual leases in place at
the time of acquisition and to current assets and liabilities acquired, if any. The value allocated to in place leases is amortized over the original lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations.

When applicable as lessee, we classify our leases of land and buildings as
operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases”.

Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and their
related direct costs are capitalized in accordance with GAAP. The capitalized costs associated with developments, redevelopments and leasing are depreciated or amortized over the life of the improvement or lease, whichever is shorter. Unamortized
leasing costs are charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease.

Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of the development and redevelopment until it is placed in service.
Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, i.e. when the asset is ready for its intended use. Generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its
intended use upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (effective for us on January 1,
2002). SFAS No. 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly-acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an
entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” which addresses accounting and
processing for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. SFAS No. 146 requires the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred versus the date the Trust commits to an
exit plan. In addition, SFAS No. 146 states that the liability should be initially measured at fair value. The requirements of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. This pronouncement
has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

. We define cash as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short term liquid investments with an initial maturity under three months. Cash balances in individual
banks may exceed insurable amounts.

Prepaid Expenses and
Other Assets.

Consists primarily of lease commissions and property taxes. Also included are the premiums paid for split dollar life insurance covering several officers and former officers which were approximately $4.4 million and $3.8 million at
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003.

Debt Issue
Costs

. Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are capitalized and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the related issue using the effective interest method. Upon conversion or in the event of early redemption, any
unamortized costs are expensed.

F-9


Risk Management.

We enter into derivative contracts, which qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS
No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, in order to manage interest rate risk. Derivatives are not purchased for speculation. There were no open derivative contracts at December 31, 2003. In January 2004, to
hedge our exposure to interest rates on our $150 million five-year term loan issued in October 2003, we entered into interest rate swaps, which fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.401% through October 2006.

Acquisition, Development and Construction Loan Arrangements

. We
have made certain mortgage loans that, because of their nature, qualify as loan receivables. At the time the loans were made, we did not intend for the arrangement to be anything other than a financing and did not contemplate a real estate
investment. Using guidance set forth in the Third Notice to Practitioners issued by the AICPA in February 1986 entitled “ADC Arrangements” (“the Third Notice”), we evaluate each investment to determine whether the loan
arrangement qualifies under the Third Notice as a loan, joint venture or real estate investment and the appropriate accounting thereon. Such determination affects our balance sheet classification of these investments and the recognition of interest
income derived therefrom. Generally, we receive additional interest on these loans, however we never receive in excess of 50% of the residual profit in the project (as defined in the Third Notice) and because the borrower has either a substantial
investment in the project or has guaranteed all or a portion of our loan (or a combination thereof) the loans qualify for loan accounting. The amounts under ADC arrangements at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $42.9 million and $41.5 million
respectively and interest income recognized thereon was $4.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively.

Comprehensive Income

. Our interest rate swaps were documented as cash flow hedges and designated as effective at inception of the swap contract,
therefore, the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swaps at their fair market value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”, investments purchased in connection with our nonqualified deferred compensation plan are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on these
investments purchased to match our obligation to the participants is also recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2004 these investments consisted of mutual funds and are stated at market value.

Earnings Per Share

. We calculate basic and diluted earnings per share
in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted into common shares and then shared in our earnings. In 2004 the inclusion of operating partnership units had an
anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of income from continuing operations per share. Accordingly, the impact of these 709,700 units have not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations.

F-10


The following table sets forth the reconciliation between basic and diluted EPS:

F-11


Stock-Based Compensation.

In December 2002 the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure” as an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure provisions to require prominent disclosure about the effects
on reported net income of an entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based compensation. Stock options are accounted for using the intrinsic method in accordance with APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” as interpreted, whereby if options are priced at fair market value or above at the date of grant and the number of shares is fixed or certain, no compensation expense is recognized. In addition, certain of our stock-based
compensation arrangements provide for performance-based vesting which calls for the use of “variable plan accounting” whereby compensation expense is periodically recorded for the intrinsic value of vested shares. Historically,
compensation arising from such arrangements has not been material to operations. In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB No. 123(R) which changes the accounting required for stock options. FASB No. 123(R) is required
to be implemented in fiscal quarters which begin after June 15, 2005. When implemented by the Trust, we estimate the impact to be a reduction of net income of $0.2 million and $0.4 million in fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively.

The pro forma information required under SFAS No. 148 is as follows:

Reclassifications

. Certain components of rental income, other property income, rental expense, real estate tax expense and depreciation and amortization on the December 31, 2002 Consolidated Statements of Operations have been
reclassified to operating income from discontinued operations to assure comparability of all periods presented. In addition, certain income statement accounts and balance sheet accounts have been reclassified to assure comparability of all periods
presented.

Redemption of preferred stock.

On June 13,
2003, we redeemed our $100 million 7.95% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at their face value. The original issuance costs of $3.4 million were charged to shareholders’ equity in 1997, when the shares were issued. On July 31,
2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force provided clarification on the treatment of the difference between the redemption value and the carrying value, adjusting for issuance costs, for GAAP financial reporting. As a result of this change in accounting
presentation, our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflects a charge of $3.4 million in “Preferred stock redemption costs” as a reduction of net income in computing net income available for common
shareholders.

F-12


Variable Interest Entities

. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (FIN 46-R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” FIN 46-R clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, for certain entities that do
not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest
(“variable interest entities”). Variable interest entities within the scope of FIN 46-R will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party
that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected returns, or both. We have evaluated the applicability of FIN 46-R to our investments in certain restaurant joint ventures at Santana Row and our joint
venture with Clarion Lion Properties Fund and determined that these joint ventures do not meet the requirements of a variable interest entity and, therefore, consolidation of these ventures is not required. Accordingly, these investments will
continue to be accounted for using the equity method. We have also evaluated the applicability of FIN 46-R to our mortgage loans receivable and determined that they are not variable interest entities. Accordingly, these loans will continue to be
accounted for as mortgage notes receivable rather than equity investments. The adoption of FIN 46-R did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

As of December 31, 2004, we have invested approximately $8.1 million in the restaurant joint ventures, principally to fund
buildout costs of each restaurant. Of this amount, $6.8 million has been capitalized as an investment in these ventures and $1.3 million was expensed in 2002 to reflect our estimate of the permanent impairment of our investment in two of these
ventures due principally to declining economic conditions. During 2004 and 2003, respectively, we recognized $1.1 million in income and $0.2 million in loss from restaurant joint ventures and received distributions of $2.0 million and $0.6 million.
We are currently committed to invest a total of $11 million in these ventures and as such, our maximum exposure to further losses as a result of involvement in these ventures is $9.7 million at December 31, 2004.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149.

In April 2003,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” which clarifies the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments. The statement is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material effect on the Trust’s financial statements.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No 150 “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 addresses the classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments, including mandatorily redeemable preferred and common stock, and requires an issuer to
classify certain instruments as liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have material effect on the Trust’s financial Statements.

. REAL ESTATE AND ENCUMBRANCES

A summary of our real estate investments at December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as
follows:

Retail and mixed-use
properties includes the residential portion of our Santana Row development property. The residential property investments comprised our investments in Rollingwood Apartments and Crest Apartments at Congressional Plaza.

Real Estate Transactions—2004

On March 31, 2004, we acquired Westgate Mall, a 637,000 square foot shopping
center located in San Jose, California. The purchase price of the property of $97.0 million was paid from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which were subsequently repaid from the proceeds of our April 2004 common equity offering.
Approximately $1.7 million of the net assets acquired were allocated to prepaids and other assets for “above-market leases,” while $18.0 million was allocated to other liabilities and deferred credits for “below-market leases,”
to account for the fair value assigned to the assumed leases at the property as non-cash transaction. Amounts associated with above and below market leases are amortized over the related lease terms. Amortization is included in rental income on the
consolidated statement of operations.

On June 3, 2004, we sold
a parcel of land at the Village at Shirlington in Arlington, Virginia, for $4.9 million. This transaction was related to a previous land sale to Arlington County for $0.3 million, which closed in March 2004. The combined transactions resulted in a
net gain of $2.8 million.

On June 14, 2004, Magruder’s
Center in Rockville, Maryland, which was owned by one of our partnerships, was condemned by the City of Rockville in order to facilitate the redevelopment of the Rockville Town Center. We received $14.3 million in condemnation proceeds from the City
of Rockville, resulting in a gain of $5.4 million.

In July
2004, at a contribution value of approximately $20.6 million, we contributed Plaza del Mercado to a newly formed joint venture in exchange for a 30% ownership interest and $18.6 million of proceeds. The joint venture simultaneously financed the
property with a $13.3 million 10-year secured loan. We recognized a gain of $0.1 million on this transaction.

On August 12, 2004 we closed on a land exchange with Arlington County, Virginia. The exchange of one-acre parcels at the Village at Shirlington occurred
in order to facilitate future redevelopment at the property.

On September 16, 2004 we sold 3.1 acres of land at the Village at Shirlington in Arlington, Virginia in two separate transactions for a total of $2.8 million, resulting in a gain of $0.9 million.

F-14


On September 30, 2004 we paid $2.3 million to purchase 10% of the partnership interests in Street Retail
West 6, LP, giving us 100% ownership of 140-168 W. Colorado located in Pasadena, California.

On October 1, 2004 we paid $0.8 million to purchase 15% of the partnership interests in Street Retail Tempe, LLC, giving us 100% ownership of 501 South Mill located in Tempe, Arizona.

On October 12, 2004 we purchased Shaw’s Plaza, located in Carver,
Massachusetts for $4.0 million. The allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired resulting in no value being allocated to “above-market leases” or “below-market leases.”

On November 10, 2004 we issued 40,201 of our common shares in a non-cash
transaction to purchase 10% of the partnership interests in Street Retail West 10, LP, giving us 100% ownership of 214 Wilshire Boulevard, located in Santa Monica, California.

On December 15, 2004 we sold one building on West Hartford, Connecticut and two buildings in Avon, Connecticut for a total
of $11.2 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $3.6 million.

On December 29, 2004 we sold one property in Evanston, Illinois for $4.0 million, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million.

Results of properties sold constitute discontinued operations and as such, the accompanying financial statements have been restated to reclassify the
operations of these properties as discontinued operations. A summary of the financial information for the discontinued operations is as follows:

Mortgages payable and
capital lease obligations are due in installments over various terms extending to 2028 and 2060, respectively, with interest rates ranging from 3.14% to 11.25%. Certain of the capital lease obligations require additional interest payments based upon
property performance.

The following is a summary of mortgages
payable as of December 31, 2004:

F-15


Scheduled principal payments on mortgage loan indebtedness as of December 31, 2004 are as follows:

Future minimum lease
payments and their present value for property under capital leases as of December 31, 2004, are as follows:

Our 106 retail
properties at December 31, 2004 are located in 14 states and the District of Columbia. There are approximately 2,200 tenants providing a wide range of retail products and services. These tenants range from sole proprietorships to national retailers;
no one tenant or corporate group of tenants accounts for more than 2.3% of annualized base rent.

Our leases with commercial property and residential tenants are classified as operating leases. Leases on apartments are generally for a period of one
year or less. Commercial property leases generally range from three to ten years (certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer), and in addition to minimum rents, usually provide for contingent rentals based on the tenant’s gross sales and
sharing of certain operating costs.

Minimum future commercial
property rentals on noncancelable operating leases, before any reserve for uncollectible amounts, on operating properties as of December 31, 2004 are as follows:

Income Statement Components

The principal components of rental income are as follows:

The income statement
adjustment recorded to recognize rent on a straight-line basis was an increase to minimum rents of $3.6 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, minimum rents includes
$1.6 million and $0.3 million to recognize income for market lease adjustments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The principal components of rental expense are as follows:

NOTE 3.

MORTGAGE NOTES RECEIVABLE

Mortgage
notes receivable of $42.9 million are due over various terms from March 2005 to May 2021 and have a weighted average interest rate of 11.25%. Under the terms of certain of these mortgages, we will receive additional interest based upon the gross
income of the secured properties and, upon sale of the properties, we will share in the appreciation of the properties. The carrying value of mortgage notes receivable was reduced in 2004 with an allowance for collectibility of $4.4 million. For one
mortgagee note, the mortgage can accrue up to an additional $3.1 million of unpaid interest under the mortgage.

On February 1, 2002, we redeemed the minority partner’s interest in Santana Row in exchange for a $2.6 million investment in a partnership. We made a
$5.9 million loan to the partnership in January 2001 that was due February 28, 2003 but was not repaid on the due date. The loan was renegotiated with an interest rate of 6.0%. The loan is secured by an office building in San Francisco, California
and is due to mature on March 31, 2005. Interest on the loan is current through December 31, 2004 and based in part on the value of the underlying collateral, we believe the loan is collectible and as such, no reserve has been established at this
time.

NOTE 4.

REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIP

In July 2004, we entered into a joint venture arrangement (“the
Partnership”) by forming a limited partnership with affiliates of Clarion Lion Properties Fund (“Clarion”), a discretionary fund created and advised by ING Clarion Partners. We own 30% of the equity in the Partnership, and Clarion
owns 70%. The Partnership plans to acquire up to $350 million of stabilized, supermarket-anchored shopping centers in the Trust’s East and West regions. Federal Realty and Clarion have committed to contribute to the Partnership up to $42
million and $98 million, respectively, of equity capital to acquire properties through June 2006. Initially Clarion contributed $5.3 million in cash to the Partnership, and we contributed Plaza del Mercado, a shopping center in Montgomery County,
Maryland, which we acquired in 2003, at a contribution value of approximately $20.6 million. Concurrently with the contribution of Plaza del Mercado, the Partnership obtained a $13.3 million, 10-year loan secured by the property, and we received
proceeds of $18.6 million. We are the manager of the Partnership and its properties, earning fees for acquisitions, management, leasing, and financing. We also have the opportunity to receive performance-based earnings through our Partnership
interest. In 2004, the Partnership acquired three shopping centers in the East for $55.2 million. We account for our interest in the Partnership using the equity method, as described in “Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Variable Interest Entities.” In total, at December 31, 2004, the partnership had $47.2 million of mortgage notes outstanding.

The following are the summarized financial results from inception (July 1, 2004) to December 31, 2004 and the financial position of the Partnership as of
December 31, 2004:

For the loans secured
by Plaza del Mercado, Campus Plaza and Pleasant Shops, we are the guarantor for the obligations of the joint venture, which are commonly referred to as “non-recourse carve-outs.” We are not guaranteeing repayment of the debt itself. The
Partnership indemnifies us for any loss we incur under these guarantees.

NOTE 5.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by us, using
available market information and appropriate valuation methods. Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimates of fair value. The estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon
disposition of the financial instruments.

We estimate the fair
value of our financial instruments using the following methods and assumptions: (1) quoted market prices, when available, are used to estimate the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities; (2) quoted market prices were used
to estimate the fair value of our marketable convertible subordinated debentures; (3) discounted cash flow analyses are used to estimate the fair value of mortgage notes receivable and payable, using our estimate of current interest rates for
similar notes in 2004, the carrying amount on the balance sheet was used to approximate fair value for mortgage notes receivable since these notes are for specific deals, some contain participation provisions based on the property performance and
also are convertible into ownership of the properties; (4) carrying amounts on the balance sheet approximate fair value for cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short term borrowings. Notes receivable from officers are excluded from fair
value estimation since they have been issued in connection with employee stock ownership programs.

NOTE 6.

NOTES PAYABLE

Our notes payable
consist of the following, as of December 31:

We have a $550 million
unsecured credit facility consisting of a $150 million five-year term loan, a $100 million three-year term loan, and a $300 million three-year revolving credit facility, with a one-year extension option. The term loans currently bear interest at
LIBOR plus 95 basis points, while the revolving facility currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The spread over LIBOR is subject to adjustment based on our credit rating.

F-19


In January 2004, to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the $150 million five-year term
loan, we entered into an interest rate swap, which fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.401% through October 2006. The interest rate on the term loan as of December 31, 2003 was 2.1%, based on LIBOR plus 95 basis
points. The current interest rate, taking into account the swap, is 3.351% (2.401% plus 0.95%) on notional amounts totaling $150 million.

The maximum amount drawn under these revolving credit facilities during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $165.0 million, $215.0 million and $225.0 million,
respectively. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 2.2%, 3.4% and 5.0%, respectively, and the average amount outstanding was $74.4 million, $96.9 million and $189.1 million, respectively. The facility requires
us to comply with various financial covenants, including the maintenance of a minimum shareholders’ equity and a maximum ratio of debt to net worth. At December 31, 2004 we were in compliance with all loan covenants.

On September 27, 2004 we issued a note payable in the amount of $8.6 million.
The note balance was paid in full on February 1, 2005. See “Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies.”

A more detailed description of our derivative instruments is contained below in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk.”

We have determined that our hedged derivatives
qualify as effective cash-flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, resulting in our recording all changes in the fair value of the hedged derivatives in other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into
earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the hedged cash flows. To adjust the hedged derivatives to their fair value, we recorded unrealized gains to other comprehensive income of $2.4 million and $3.6 million during the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The estimated amount, included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2004, expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months to offset the variability of cash
flows during this period, is not material.

We assess, both at
inception and on an on-going basis, the effectiveness of all hedges in offsetting cash flows of hedged items. Hedge ineffectiveness did not have a material impact on earnings and we do not anticipate that it will have a material effect in the
future. The fair values of the obligations under the hedged derivatives are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTE 7

. SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES

Unsecured senior notes and debentures at December 31, 2004 and 2003 consist of the following:

F-20


These loan agreements contain various covenants, including limitations on the amount of debt and minimum
debt service coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all covenants. No principal is due on these notes prior to maturity.

In October 2002, we filed a $500 million shelf registration statement, declared effective on November 6, 2002, with the Securities and Exchange Commission
which allows the issuance of debt securities, preferred shares and common shares. As of December 31, 2004, $225 million was available under our shelf registration.

On January 26, 2004, we issued $75 million of fixed rate notes, which mature in February 2011 and bear interest at 4.50%.
The proceeds of this note offering were used to pay down our revolving credit facility by $50 million and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes.

We paid off our 6.74% Medium Term Notes on their due date of March 10, 2004 for their full principal balance of $39.5 million plus accrued interest of
$1.2 million.

NOTE 8.

DIVIDENDS

On December 14, 2004 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $0.505 per common share, payable January 17, 2005 to common shareholders of record January 3, 2005. The total dividend declared per common share for 2004 was $1.975.

Also on December 14, 2004 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53125 per share on its Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares, payable on January 31, 2005 to shareholders of record on January 17, 2005, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, $0.10 of dividends paid per common share represented a capital gain and $0.11 of dividends paid per Series B
preferred share represented a capital gain. For the year ended December 31, 2003, $0.29 of dividends paid per common share represent a capital gain while $0.36 of dividends per Series B preferred share and $0.21 of dividends paid per Series A
preferred share represented a capital gain.

NOTE 9.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are
involved in various lawsuits and environmental matters arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

We are committed to invest approximately $11.0 million in restaurant joint
ventures at Santana Row, of which $8.1 million has been invested as of December 31, 2004. These restaurant joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method as described in “Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies—Variable Interest Entities.”

Under the
terms of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement, from and after January 1, 1986, an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between one-half to all of its 29.47% interest in
Congressional Plaza at the interest’s then-current fair market value. Based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of December 31, 2004, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from
approximately $34 million to $38 million. In conjunction with the construction of the apartments at the property that were completed in 2003, 8.03% of the third party’s interest in Congressional Plaza was re-allocated to us, effective January
1, 2004, thereby lowering the third party’s ownership percentage from 37.50% to its current level of 29.47%, as a result of our having funded approximately $7 million of the third party’s share of the redevelopment cost.

F-21


Under the terms of various other partnership agreements for entities, which own shopping center
properties with a cost of approximately $88.5 million, the partners have the right to exchange their operating units for cash or the same number of our common shares, at our option. In 2004 we paid $399,000 to redeem 9,767 of these operating units
and issued 203,130 of our common shares in non-cash transactions to redeem the same amount of units. As of December 31, 2004, a total of 449,325 operating units are outstanding.

On September 27, 2004, in a non-cash transaction, 190,000 operating units were redeemed by the issuance of a promissory note
in the amount of $8.6 million. In connection with the issuance of that note, we issued to one of our subsidiaries 190,000 of our common shares, having a value of $8.6 million, which have been pledged as security for that note. On February 1, 2005
the shares were sold and the note balance of $8.6 million was paid in full.

Street Retail San Antonio LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust, entered into a Development Agreement (the “Agreement”) in 2000 with the City of San Antonio, Texas (the “City”) related to the
redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along Houston Street. Under the Agreement, we are required to issue an annual letter of credit, commencing on October 1, 2002 and ending on September 30, 2014, that covers our designated portion of the
debt service should the incremental tax revenue generated in the Zone not cover the debt service. We posted a letter of credit with the City on September 25, 2002 for $795,000, and the letter of credit remains outstanding. Our obligation under the
Agreement is estimated to range from $1.6 million to $3.0 million. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we funded approximately $434,000 and $360,000, respectively. In anticipation of further shortfalls of incremental tax revenues to
the City, $700,000 remains accrued as of December 31, 2004 to cover additional payments we may be obligated to make as part of the project costs. Prior to the expiration of the Agreement on September 30, 2014, we could be required to provide funding
beyond the $700,000 currently accrued. We do not anticipate, however, that our obligation would exceed $600,000 in any year or $3 million in total. If the Zone creates sufficient tax increment funding to repay the City’s debt prior to the
expiration of the Agreement, we will be eligible to receive reimbursement of amounts paid for debt service shortfalls together with interest thereon.

We have three leases in which the lessor has a put option, which would require us to purchase the properties during the remaining lease term. If the
lessor were to exercise this option in 2005, the purchase price would be approximately $63 million. A master lease for Mercer Mall includes a fixed purchase price option for $55 million in 2023. If we fail to exercise our purchase option, the owner
of Mercer Mall has a put option which would require us to purchase Mercer Mall for $60 million in 2025.

As of December 31, 2004 in connection with renovation and development projects, the Trust has contractual obligations of approximately $50 million.

We are obligated under ground lease agreements on several
shopping centers requiring minimum annual payments as follows, as of December 31, 2004:

F-22


NOTE 10.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

In May 1999, we reorganized as a Maryland real estate investment trust by
amending and restating our declaration of trust and bylaws. The Amended Declaration of Trust changed the number of authorized shares of common and preferred shares from unlimited to 100,000,000 and 15,000,000, respectively. In addition, all common
shares of beneficial interest, no par value, which were issued and outstanding were changed to common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share and all Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of beneficial interest, no par
value, which were issued and outstanding were changed to Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share.

In November 2001, we issued 5.4 million 8.5% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at $25 per share in a public offering. The Series B Preferred
Shares are not redeemable prior to November 27, 2006. On or after that date, the Preferred Shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends on the
Preferred Shares are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of January, April, July and October.

On June 12, 2002, we issued 2.2 million common shares at $25.9825 per share ($27.35 gross, before a 5.00% underwriters discount and selling concession)
netting $56.6 million in cash proceeds after all expenses of the offering.

On May 14, 2003, we issued 3.2 million common shares at $30.457 per share ($31.48 gross, before an aggregate 3.25% underwriters discount and selling concession) netting $98.4 million in cash proceeds, after all
expenses of the offering.

On April 7, 2004, we issued 2.2
million common shares at a net price of $45.33 per share (after taking into account underwriters discount and commissions) netting approximately $99 million in cash proceeds before other expenses of the offering. The proceeds were used to repay
borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility that were drawn to acquire Westgate Mall and for general corporate purposes.

We have a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, whereby shareholders may use their dividends and optional cash payments to purchase shares. In 2004, 2003 and 2002,
82,391 shares, 109,835 shares and 134,247 shares, respectively, were issued under the Plan.

In December 1999, the Trustees authorized a share repurchase program for calendar year 2000 of up to an aggregate of 4 million of our common shares. During 2000, a total of 1,325,900 shares were repurchased, at a cost
of $25.2 million. We did not repurchase shares in 2004, 2003 or 2002.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, 84,617 common shares, 138,568 common shares and 98,092 common shares, respectively, were awarded to key employees, including our former Chief Executive Officer, under various incentive compensation programs designed
to directly link a significant portion of their current and long term compensation to the prosperity of the Trust and its shareholders. The shares vest over terms from 3 to 5 years. Vesting of common shares awarded to the former Chief Executive
Officer was accelerated in 2002 pursuant to his contractual arrangement. We recorded compensation expense of $3.5 million, $1.3 million and $4.4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, under our 2001 Long Term Incentive Plan. The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock awarded in 2004 was $42.94.

In February 2002 and February 2003, we granted Performance Awards of 30,000 and 120,000, respectively, to certain officers and employees of the Trust. Pursuant to the terms of these awards, 20% of the Performance
Shares will vest for any calendar year in which we exceed certain performance targets for the same period. Any performance awards, which remain unvested after 2011 and 2012, respectively, will be forfeited. We employ variable accounting for these
Performance Awards.

Pursuant to the 2004 Incentive Bonus Plan,
vice presidents and certain key employees receive part of their bonus in our common shares, which vest over three years. Consequently, on February 15, 2005, 7,711 shares

F-23


were awarded under this plan. In addition, on February 15, 2004, 64,732 restricted shares, which will vest over three years, were awarded to the Trust’s
officers and certain key employees. We also granted 3,363 restricted shares on February 15, 2005 to our Trustees. All of the restricted share awards were made under the 2001 Plan.

Tax loans with a balance of $300,000 in 2004 and 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002 have been made in connection with restricted
share grants to certain of our officers and in connection with the Share Purchase Plans. The loans bear interest at the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 75 basis points. No tax loans were repaid in 2004.

In March 1999, we entered into an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement with
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, pursuant to which (i) the expiration date of our shareholder rights plan was extended for an additional ten years to April 24, 2009, (ii) the beneficial ownership percentage at which a person becomes an
“Acquiring Person” under the plan was reduced from 20% to 15%, and (iii) certain other amendments were made. On October 29, 2003, we further amended the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement to increase the beneficial ownership percentage
at which a person becomes an “Acquiring Person” under the plan from 15% to 20% and to require that the Trust’s Board of Trustees review the plan on a periodic basis.

NOTE 11

. STOCK OPTION PLAN

The 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”) authorized the grant of options and other stock based awards for up to
5.5 million shares. Options granted under the Plan have ten year terms and vest in one to five years. The Plan expired in May 2003.

In May 2001 our shareholders’ approved the 2001 Long Term Incentive Plan (“2001 Plan”) which authorized an additional 1,750,000 shares for
future option and other stock based awards.

The option price
to acquire shares under the 2001 Plan and previous plans is required to be at least the fair market value at the date of grant. As a result of the exercise of options, we had outstanding from our officers and employees notes for $1.8 million, $3.3
million and $2.5 million at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Notes bear interest at LIBOR plus a market-rate spread with the rate adjusted annually. The notes are collateralized by the shares with recourse to the borrower and have
five-year terms. Option awards made in 2001 and later do not provide for employees to be able to exercise their options with a loan from the Trust.

SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” requires pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share as if we
accounted for our stock options under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123. Where at the date of grant, either the numbers of shares or exercise prices are not known; we record compensation expense in accordance with variable accounting. The fair
value for options issued in 2004, 2003 and 2002 has been estimated as $1.1 million, $582,000 and $536,000, respectively, as of the date of grant, using a Black Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively: risk-free interest rates of 4.5%, 3.2% and 4.5%; volatility factors of the expected market price of our shares of 20%, 16% and 20%; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 5.3 years, 6.0 years and 6.9 years. Our assumed
weighted average dividend yield used to estimate the fair value of the options issued was 4.62% in 2004.

Because option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, such as the expected stock price volatility, and because changes in
these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing model may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.

NOTE 12

. SAVINGS
AND RETIREMENT PLANS

We have a savings and retirement plan in
accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. For employees who choose to contribute, their contributions range, at their discretion, from 1% to 20% of compensation up to a maximum of $11,000. Under the plan, we
contribute out of our current net income, 50% of each employee’s first 5% of contributions. In addition, we may make discretionary contributions within the limits of deductibility set forth by the Code. Our employees are immediately eligible to
become plan participants. Effective as of January 1, 2005 employees are eligible to receive matching contributions immediately on their participation, however, these matching payments will not vest until their first anniversary of employment. Our
expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $252,000, $237,000 and $239,000, respectively.

A nonqualified deferred compensation plan for our officers and certain other employees was established in 1994. The plan allows the participants to defer
future income until the earlier of age 65 or termination of

F-25


employment. As of December 31, 2004, we are liable to participants for approximately $3.9 million under this plan. Although this is an unfunded plan, we have
purchased certain investments with which to match this obligation. Our obligation under this plan and the related investments are both included in the accompanying financial statements.

NOTE 13

. INTEREST EXPENSE

We incurred interest totaling $90.2 million, $88.7 million and $88.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which
$5.1 million, $13.5 million, and $23.5 million respectively, was capitalized. Interest paid was $69.8 million in 2004, $85.7 million in 2003 and $86.2 million in 2002.

NOTE 14.

CHANGE IN BUSINESS PLAN

In 2002, we adopted a new business plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of acquiring and
redeveloping community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by supermarkets, drug stores, or high volume, value oriented retailers that provide consumer necessities. Concurrent with the adoption of the business plan, we adopted a
management succession plan and restructured our management team.

In connection with this change in our business plan, we recorded a charge of $18.2 million in 2002. This charge included a restructuring charge of $8.5 million made up of $6.9 million of severance and other compensation costs for several of
our senior officers related to the management restructuring, as well as the write-off of $1.6 million of our development costs. All charges against the reserve, totaling $8.5 million, were expended during 2002. An additional component of the
restructuring charge was an impairment loss of $9.6 million representing the estimated loss on the abandonment of development projects held for sale, primarily the Tanasbourne development project located in Washington County, Oregon, thereby
adjusting the value of these assets to their estimated fair value. The Tanasbourne land was sold in 2003 for approximately $9.7 million resulting in a gain of $1.9 million.

In December 2002, we announced the resignation of Steven J. Guttman as Trustee, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board of Trustees effective January 1, 2003. Donald C. Wood, our then President and Chief Operating Officer, was named Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Trustees. Mark Ordan, a member of the Board of Trustees since 1996, was named
non-executive chairman of the board. As a result of this restructuring, we recorded a charge of $13.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for payments and benefits to Mr. Guttman pursuant to his contractual arrangements with the Trust and for
other transition related costs, which we would not otherwise have incurred. Of this amount, $0.8 million had not been paid as of December 31, 2003 and $0.3 million remains to be expended as of December 31, 2004.

NOTE 15

. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On March 2, 2005, we acquired Assembly Square, an approximately 330,000
square foot enclosed mall that is currently being redeveloped into a power center, and an adjacent 220,000 square foot retail/industrial complex for $64 million. The properties are located in the City of Somerville, Massachusetts. The acquisition
was financed through available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

The Trust expects to invest an additional $38 million to complete the redevelopment of the mall into a power center, with stabilization anticipated within 12 months. The acquisition of Assembly Square also includes
zoning entitlements to add four mixed-use buildings on 3.5 acres, which will include approximately 41,000 square feet of retail space, 51,000 square feet of office and 239 residential units.

The 10-acre parcel, which comprises approximately 220,000 square feet of
improvements, is currently 100% leased to a mix of quasi-retail and industrial uses. This parcel also includes an option to purchase adjacent land parcels from the Somerville Redevelopment Authority, all of which are zoned for dense, mixed-use
development.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

We operate our portfolio of properties in two geographic operating regions:
East and West, which constitute our segments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” Based on changes in our property management structure in 2004, we
determined that our portfolio should be divided into two operating regions (East and West), rather than three (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West as previously reported).

A summary of our operations by geographic region is presented below:

MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE

Year Ended December 31, 2004

1)

For Federal tax purposes, the aggregate tax basis is approximately $47,430,000 as of December 31, 2004. No payments are delinquent on these mortgages.

2)

Loan receivable was originally due February 28, 2003 but was not repaid on the due date. The loan was renegotiated in 2004 and the interest rate on the note was decreased to 6%
retroactive to July 1, 2003. Interest on the loan is current through December 31, 2004 and based in part on the value of the underlying collateral, we believe that the loan is collectible and as such, no reserve has been established at this time.

3)

Through May 2006, interest is payable from cash flow, if available. If cash flow is not sufficient to pay interest in full, mortgagee may borrow up to a maximum loan amount of
$19,450,000. Any unpaid amounts due will accrue and bear interest at the same rate as the principal. After year five, current interest payments are required. After year seven, mortgagee is required to apply 50% of all available cash flow to
repayment of principal. In 2004, an additional $1,950,000 of advances was made on this loan.

4)

This mortgage is available for up to $25,000,000.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Quarterly Assessment.

We carried out an assessment as of December 31,
2004 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures and the conclusions of our management about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Certifications.

Included as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to
this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forms of “Certification” of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer. The forms of Certification are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K that you currently are reading is the information concerning the assessment referred to in the Section 302 certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302
certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form
10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive
Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and
procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our President and Chief Executive Officer
and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, and effected by our employees, including management and our Board of Trustees, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This process includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets in reasonable detail;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorization procedures we have established; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of any of our assets in circumstances that could have a
material adverse effect on our financial statements.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial



reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating our control system, management recognized that any control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, that may affect our operation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management’s override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and not be detected.

Scope of the Evaluations.

The evaluation by our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of procedures and our internal audit, as well as
discussions with our Disclosure Committee, independent public accountants and others in our organization, as appropriate. In conducting this evaluation, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

In the course of the evaluation, we sought to identify data errors, control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action, including
process improvements, were being undertaken. The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis, so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such
controls can be reported in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

Our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our Accounting department and by our independent
auditors in connection with their audit and review activities. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications
as necessary. Our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated (including with improvements and corrections) as conditions warrant. Among other
matters, we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting, or whether we had identified any acts of fraud
involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting. This information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the Section 302 certifications require that our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer disclose that information to the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board’s Auditing Standard No. 2, a “significant deficiency” is a “control deficiency,” or a combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the ability to initiate, authorize, record,
process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or
detected. A “control deficiency” exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A
“material weakness” is defined in Auditing Standard No. 2 as a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. We also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation, and in any case in which a problem was identified, we considered what revision, improvement and/or correction was necessary
to be made in accordance with our on-going procedures.



Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

. Our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
