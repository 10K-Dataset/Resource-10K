PART I

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of Federal Realty Investment Trust (“we” “our” or “us”) and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “seeks,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “plans,” “intends,” “should” or similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law.

The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:

•

risks that our tenants will not pay rent, may vacate early or may file for bankruptcy or that we may be unable to renew leases or re-let space at favorable rents as leases expire;

•

risks that we may not be able to proceed with or obtain necessary approvals for any redevelopment or renovation project, and that completion of anticipated or ongoing property redevelopment or renovation projects that we do pursue may cost more, take more time to complete or fail to perform as expected;

•

risk that we are investing a significant amount in ground-up development projects that may be dependent on third parties to deliver critical aspects of certain projects, requires spending a substantial amount upfront in infrastructure, and assumes receipt of public funding which has been committed but not entirely funded;

•

risks normally associated with the real estate industry, including risks that occupancy levels at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive from our properties may be lower than expected, that new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected, that competition for acquisitions could result in increased prices for acquisitions, that costs associated with the periodic maintenance and repair or renovation of space, insurance and other operations may increase, that environmental issues may develop at our properties and result in unanticipated costs, and, because real estate is illiquid, that we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate;

•

risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital;

•

risks associated with general economic conditions, including local economic conditions in our geographic markets;

•

financing on terms which are acceptable to us, our ability to meet existing financial covenants and the limitations imposed on our operations by those covenants, and the possibility of increases in interest rates that would result in increased interest expense; and

•

risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust, commonly referred to as a REIT, for federal income tax purposes, such as the existence of complex tax regulations relating to our status as a REIT, the effect of future changes in REIT requirements as a result of new legislation, and the adverse consequences of the failure to qualify as a REIT.

In addition, we describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially in “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” (Part II, Item 7A), and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” (Part II, Item 7).

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

References to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Trust” refer to Federal Realty Investment Trust and our business and operations conducted through our directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries.

General

We are an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, as well as in California and South Florida. As of

December 31, 2019

, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as


predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately

23.7 million

square



feet. In total, the real estate projects were

94.2%

leased and

92.5%

occupied at

December 31, 2019

. Our revenue is primarily generated from lease agreements with tenants. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for


consecutive years.

We were founded in 1962 as a REIT under the laws of the District of Columbia and re-formed as a REIT in the state of Maryland in 1999. We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes pursuant to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Our principal executive offices are located at 1626 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Our telephone number is (301) 998-8100. Our website address is

www.federalrealty.com

. The information contained on our website is not a part of this report and is not incorporated herein by reference.

Business Objectives and Strategies

Our primary business objective is to own, manage, acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail focused properties that will:

•

provide increasing cash flow for distribution to shareholders;

•

generate higher internal growth than the shopping center industry over the long term;

•

provide potential for capital appreciation; and

•

protect investor capital.

Our portfolio includes, and we continue to acquire and redevelop, high quality retail in many formats ranging from regional, community and neighborhood shopping centers that often are anchored by grocery stores to mixed-use properties that are typically centered around a retail component but also include office, residential and/or hotel components.

Operating Strategies

Our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant, weaker, underperforming tenants with stronger ones. Our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country. These strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales, which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates, charge higher rental rates, and maintain steady rent growth, all of which increase the value of our portfolio. Our operating strategies also include:

•

increasing rental rates through the renewal of expiring leases or the leasing of space to new tenants at higher rental rates while limiting vacancy and down-time;

•

maintaining a diversified tenant base, thereby limiting exposure to any one tenant’s financial or operating difficulties;

•

monitoring the merchandising mix of our tenant base to achieve a balance of strong national and regional tenants with local specialty tenants;

•

minimizing overhead and operating costs;

•

monitoring the physical appearance of our properties and the construction quality, condition and design of the buildings and other improvements located on our properties to maximize our ability to attract customers and thereby generate higher rents and occupancy rates;

•

developing local and regional market expertise in order to capitalize on market and retailing trends;

•

leveraging the contacts and experience of our management team to build and maintain long-term relationships with tenants;

•

providing exceptional customer service; and

•

creating an experience at many of our properties that is identifiable, unique and serves the surrounding communities to help insulate these properties and the tenants at these properties from the impact of on-line retailing.

Investing Strategies

Our investment strategy is to deploy capital at risk-adjusted rates of return that exceed our long-term weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth and increased value. Our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories:

•

renovating, expanding, reconfiguring and/or retenanting our existing properties to take advantage of under-utilized land or existing square footage to increase revenue;

•

renovating or expanding tenant spaces for tenants capable of producing higher sales, and therefore, paying higher rents;

•

acquiring quality retail and mixed-use properties located in densely populated and/or affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high, and that have possibilities for enhancing operating performance and creating value through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and/or retenanting; and



•

developing the retail portions of mixed-use properties and developing or otherwise investing in non-retail portions of mixed-use properties we already own in order to capitalize on the overall value created in these properties.

Investment Criteria

When we evaluate potential redevelopment, retenanting, expansion, acquisition and development opportunities, we consider such factors as:

•

the expected returns in relation to our short and long-term cost of capital as well as the anticipated risk we will face in achieving the expected returns;

•

the anticipated growth rate of operating income generated by the property;

•

the ability to increase the long-term value of the property through redevelopment and retenanting;

•

the tenant mix at the property, tenant sales performance and the creditworthiness of those tenants;

•

the geographic area in which the property is located, including the population density, household incomes, education levels, as well as the population and income trends in that geographic area;

•

competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property, including gross leasable area (GLA) per capita, competition for tenants and the ability of others to create competing properties through redevelopment, new construction or renovation;

•

access to and visibility of the property from existing roadways and the potential for new, widened or realigned, roadways within the property’s trade area, which may affect access and commuting and shopping patterns;

•

the level and success of our existing investments in the market area;

•

the current market value of the land, buildings and other improvements and the potential for increasing those market values; and

•

the physical condition of the land, buildings and other improvements, including the structural and environmental condition.

Financing Strategies

Our financing strategies are designed to enable us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most cost-efficient way possible. Our financing strategies include:

•

maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an appropriate pool of unencumbered properties that is sufficient to support our unsecured borrowings;

•

managing our exposure to variable-rate debt;

•

maintaining an available line of credit to fund operating and investing needs on a short-term basis;

•

taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt, reduce interest costs and manage our debt maturity schedule so that a significant portion of our debt relative to our size does not mature in any one year;

•

selling properties that have limited growth potential or are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio and redeploying the proceeds to redevelop, renovate, retenant and/or expand our existing properties, acquire new properties or reduce debt; and

•

utilizing the most advantageous long-term source of capital available to us to finance redevelopment and acquisition opportunities, which may include:

◦

the sale of our equity or debt securities through public offerings, including our at-the-market ("ATM") equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares, or private placements,

◦

the incurrence of indebtedness through unsecured or secured borrowings,

◦

the issuance of operating partnership units in a new or existing “downREIT partnership” that is controlled and consolidated by us (generally operating partnership units in a “downREIT” partnership are issued in exchange for a tax deferred contribution of property; these units typically receive the same distributions as our common shares and the holders of these units have the right to exchange their units for cash or common shares, at our option), or

◦

the use of joint venture arrangements.

Employees

At

February 5, 2020

, we had 308 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

Tax Status

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders. Under the Code, REITs are



subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least

90%

of taxable income each year. We will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income (including, for our taxable years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017, any applicable alternative minimum tax) at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income. We will also generally not qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.

We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, which we refer to as a TRS. In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. Our TRS activities have not been material.

Governmental Regulations Affecting Our Properties

We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and similar laws, including without limitation:

•

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA;

•

the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act;

•

the Federal Clean Water Act;

•

the Federal Clean Air Act;

•

the Toxic Substances Control Act;

•

the Occupational Safety & Health Act; and

•

the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the current and former uses of the property, the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property. Under certain environmental laws, principally CERCLA, we, as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned, may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances, asbestos-containing materials, or petroleum product releases at the property. We may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination, whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, such contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. As the owner or operator of real estate, we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate. Such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.

Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe they will in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. We have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties.

Competition

Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties. Some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do, although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market. This competition may:

•

reduce the number of properties available for acquisition;

•

increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;

•

interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents; and

•

adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.

Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, superstores, and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services, such as direct mail. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Exchange Act and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Also, documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including documents that we subsequently file with the SEC will contain forward-looking statements. When we refer to forward-looking statements or information, sometimes we use words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “plans,” “intends,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates” and “continues.” In particular, the below risk factors describe forward-looking information. The risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. Many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. These factors include, but are not limited to the following:

Risk Factors Related to our Real Estate Investments and Operations

Revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful.

Revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis. Some of our leases provide for the payment, in addition to base rent, of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property. Economic, legal, and/or competitive conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants. Any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent, or other charges on a timely basis, including the closing of stores prior to the end of the lease term or the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In the event of default by a tenant, we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms, which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants.

Our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of any anchor store or anchor tenant. Anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property. The closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by, or reductions in rent from, other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result. We continue to see higher levels of anchor turnover and closings in some markets, which has caused an oversupply of larger retail spaces. Therefore, tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result, we may see an increase in vacancy and/or a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income. As of

December 31, 2019

, our anchor tenant space is 97.5% leased and 95.9% occupied.

A shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to online shopping may have an adverse impact on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.

Many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made online sales a vital piece of their business.  The shift to online shopping may cause declines in brick and mortar sales generated by certain of our tenants and may cause certain of our tenants to reduce the size or number of their retail locations in the future. This risk is partially mitigated by our strategy of maintaining a diverse portfolio of retail properties. The trend of retailers utilizing brick and mortar locations for ‘showroom’ and on-line sales distribution purposes (particularly at shopping centers in densely populated areas like ours) may further mitigate this risk. However, there can be no assurance that our shopping centers will not be further impacted by the shift to online shopping.  As a result, our cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have properties that are geographically concentrated, and adverse economic or real estate market declines in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us.

As of December 31, 2019, our tenants operated in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the the markets where our properties are concentrated may have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. Refer to “Properties” (Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for additional discussion of the geographic concentration. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both the short and long term.



Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in these states could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. Factors that may negatively affect economic conditions in these states include:

•

business layoffs or downsizing;

•

industry slowdowns;

•

relocations of businesses;

•

changing demographics;

•

increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;

•

infrastructure quality;

•

any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate;

•

concessions or reduced rental rates under new leases for properties where tenants defaulted; and

•

increased operating costs including insurance premiums and real estate taxes.

We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection.

If a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party. In addition, a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.

We derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants. We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, whether by their terms, as a result of a tenant bankruptcy, general economic conditions or otherwise, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates. As a result, our net income could be reduced.

Our development activities have inherent risks.

The ground-up development of improvements on real property, as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements, presents substantial risks. We generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development; however, we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own. We may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a risk-adjusted return basis. We may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return. If conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value, an impairment of the project may be required. If additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful, it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

During


, construction was substantially completed on the development of Phase II at both Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, with portions of both projects opening during 2018 and 2019. Additionally, we continued construction on Phase III at both projects, and our on-going redevelopment efforts at Santana Row. A further discussion of these projects, expected costs, and current status can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the "Outlook" subsection.

In addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general, as described elsewhere and the specific risks above, the risks associated with our remaining development activities include:

•

contractor changes may delay the completion of development projects and increase overall costs;

•

significant time lag between commencement and stabilization subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy;

•

delivery of residential product into uncertain residential environments may result in lower rents or longer time periods to reach economic stabilization;

•

substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure and the overall value of the project may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases;

•

failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms;

•

expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed;

•

difficulty securing key anchor or other tenants may impact occupancy rates and projected revenue;

•

inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of lease-up;

•

higher than estimated construction or operating costs, including labor and material costs; and



•

possible delay in completion of a project because of a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals, acts of terror or other acts of violence, or acts of God (such as fires, earthquakes or floods).

Redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected.

Our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality, retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply. The redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:

•

our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short. As a result, the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer period;

•

we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify;

•

we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully;

•

properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we project, at the time we make the decision to invest, which may result in the properties’ failure to achieve the returns we projected;

•

our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property; and

•

our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost.

Our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry.

Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently, the value of our investments, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. As a real estate company, we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks:

•

economic downturns in general, or in the areas where our properties are located;

•

adverse changes in local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or reduction in demand;

•

changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;

•

zoning or regulatory restrictions;

•

decreases in market rental rates;

•

weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;

•

costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; and

•

increases in the cost of adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, associated with one or more properties, which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties, although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues.

Each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.

Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from our properties decreases.

Our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. As a result, cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms. Under those circumstances, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. Additionally, new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied.



Competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants.

Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. This competition may:

•

reduce properties available for acquisition;

•

increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;

•

reduce rents payable to us;

•

interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;

•

lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and

•

adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.

Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods, such as direct mail. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants. If we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties, or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets, it could materially affect our ability to generate net income, service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders.

We may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In addition, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to REITs in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets. We may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment. Our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.

We may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities. As of

December 31, 2019

, we held 16 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a “downREIT” structure. Additionally, we own an interest in the joint ventures that own the hotel components of Pike & Rose and Assembly Row. We may make additional joint investments in the future. Our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks, including the possibility that our partners or co-investors might become bankrupt, that those partners or co-investors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals, that those partners or co-investors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions, or in opposition to our policies or objectives, and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution. Although as of

December 31, 2019

, we held the controlling interests in all of our existing co-investments (except the hotel investments discussed above and the investment in the La Alameda shopping center acquired in 2017), we generally must obtain the consent of the co-investor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties. Joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. We may also be liable for the actions of our co-investors.

Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties, including insurance for liability, fire, flood, earthquake, environmental matters, rental loss and acts of terrorism. All of these policies contain coverage limitations. We believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located. We intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties.

The availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control. As a result, we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices. In addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold, or, if offered, the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified. We therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. If



any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Also, due to inflation, changes in codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed. Further, we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim. Events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations, including distributions to our shareholders.

Natural disasters and climate change could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results.

Climate change may add to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. Certain of our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts, snow storms, floods and fires.  The impact of climate change or the occurrence of natural disasters can delay new development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operating costs, create additional investment costs to make improvements to existing properties to comply with climate change regulations, increase future property insurance costs, and negatively impact the tenant demand for space.  If insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events, our earnings, liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected.

Risk Factors Related to our Funding Strategies and Capital Structure

The amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

As of

December 31, 2019

, all of our

$3.4 billion

of debt outstanding has a fixed rate or is fixed via interest rate swap agreements. Of that outstanding debt, approximately

$547.2 million

was secured by all or a portion of


of our real estate projects. Our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur. The amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders. For example, it could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, property acquisitions, redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future;

•

limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares;

•

make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements;

•

require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt upon refinancing or on our variable rate, unhedged debt, if interest rates rise;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business;

•

limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital, debt refinancing, capital expenditures, acquisitions, redevelopments or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms; and/or

•

limit our flexibility in conducting our business, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms.

Our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs. If we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs, including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust. We cannot assure you that any such refinancing, sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable.

We are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements.

Our revolving credit facility and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. We are also required to comply with additional covenants that include, among other things, provisions:

•

relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage;

•

restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;



•

restricting our ability to incur additional debt;

•

restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage;

•

restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and

•

restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants. If we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants, including the covenants listed above, and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. Many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.

Adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

Our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, financial condition and prospects, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general. Our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access, as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain. Since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business, an adverse change in our credit rating, including actual changes in outlook, or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change, could have a material adverse effect on us.

Our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital.

Our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties. We believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because, in addition to other requirements, we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least

90%

of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties. If economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital, we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms.  Additionally, we cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. Our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile, our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. Depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy.

Rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares.

Of our

$3.4 billion

of debt outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

, approximately

$56.5 million

bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 195.0 basis points and is effectively fixed through two interest rate swap agreements. We also have a

$1.0 billion

revolving credit facility, on which

no

balance was outstanding at

December 31, 2019

, that bears interest at

LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points

. We may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future. Increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders. We may enter into additional hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. However, the amounts we are required to pay under variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any such hedging arrangements. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost and/or timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares.

The phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under our variable rate debt and interest rate swap arrangements.

LIBOR is used as a reference rate for our revolving credit facility, certain mortgage payables, and in our interest rate swap arrangements. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time, if a new method of calculating LIBOR will be established, or if an alternative reference rate will be established. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the



Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or if SOFR, or another alternative rate reference rate, attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we will need to agree upon a benchmark replacement index with the bank, and as such the interest rate on our revolving credit facility and certain mortgage payables may change. The new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out. Furthermore, the transition process may result in delays in funding, higher interest expense, additional expenses, and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR, all of which could negatively impact our cash flow.

We may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a REIT.

As a REIT, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least

90%

of our taxable income. We are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain. In addition, we would be subject to a 4% excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income, capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the Code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax. We may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because:

•

our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income; and

•

non-deductible capital expenditures, creation of reserves, or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income.

In these circumstances, we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive. Current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash.

Risk Factors Related to our Company and the Market Price of our Securities

The market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility.

As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors, which may change from time to time and/or may be unrelated to our financial condition, operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices. These factors include, among others:

•

general economic and financial market conditions;

•

level and trend of interest rates;

•

our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital;

•

the issuance of additional equity or debt securities;

•

changes in our funds from operations (“FFO”) or earnings estimates;

•

changes in our credit or analyst ratings;

•

our financial condition and performance;

•

market perception of our business compared to other REITs; and

•

market perception of REITs, in general, compared to other investment alternatives.

We cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.

Our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate, and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities, will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:

•

our financial condition and results of future operations;

•

the performance by our tenants under their contractual lease agreements;

•

the terms of our loan covenants; and

•

our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.

If we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities. Any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares. Conversely, payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer.



Loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares.

We are dependent on the efforts of our key management. Although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives, the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares.

We may adjust our business policies without shareholder approval.

We may modify our approach to investment, financing, borrowing, and other operating strategies without shareholder approval. A change in the approach to any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities.

Our current business plan focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixed-use properties, principally through redevelopments and acquisitions. If this business plan is not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we make, including those in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors.

We face risks relating to cyber attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions.

We rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions and manage our business, and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cyber attacks. These could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems as well as attacks on third party's information technology systems that we rely on to provide important information technology services relating to key business functions, such as payroll. Attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations. We employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place, frequent backups, a redundant data system for core applications and penetration testing; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack. A cyber attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations.

Risk Factors Related to our REIT Status and Other Laws and Regulations

Environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties.

All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials, environmental protection and human health and safety. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate, and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. This liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release. The presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral. The costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. We are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations taken as a whole. The uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the property-specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties. If we are subject to any material environmental liabilities, the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations.

We cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future. Compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. Our tenants, like many of their competitors, have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations, which will adversely affect their potential profitability.

Generally, our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements. Our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant. If a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply, we could be



forced to pay these costs. If not addressed, environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or re-lease the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments.

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties.

Our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with this Act. The requirements of this Act, or of other federal, state or local laws or regulations, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. Future compliance with this Act may require expensive changes to the properties.

The revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal, state and local laws to which they are subject.

We and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws and state and local fire, life-safety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties. The leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations. Failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties. Non-compliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant, could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any non-compliance, and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property.

Failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions.

We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code. However, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the Code. Certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income. Satisfying this requirement could be difficult, for example, if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents. As a REIT, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least

90%

of our taxable income. In addition, new legislation, new regulations, new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. Any modification in the tax treatment of REITs could have a significant adverse impact to our net income.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income;

•

we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified;

•

we could be required to pay significant income taxes, which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders for each year in which we failed or were not permitted to qualify; and

•

we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders.

To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own.

The Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning (actually or constructively) more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares. The constructive ownership rules are complex. Shares of our capital stock owned, actually or constructively, by a group of related individuals and/or entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares and/or a class or series of preferred shares (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity (or another) to own constructively more than 9.8% in value of the



outstanding capital stock. If that happened, either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 9.8% ownership limit.

The Board of Trustees may waive these restrictions on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the Board of Trustees and two-thirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The 9.8% ownership restrictions may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest.

U.S. federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect REITs, both positively and negatively, in ways that are difficult to anticipate.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”), signed into law on December 22, 2017, represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes.  While we currently do not expect the 2017 Tax Act will have a significant direct impact on us, it may impact us indirectly as our tenants and the jurisdictions in which we do business as well as the overall investment thesis for REITs may be impacted both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to predict. Additionally, the overall impact of the 2017 Tax Act depends on future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by federal tax authorities, as well as changes in state and local taxation in response to the 2017 Tax Act, and it is possible that such future interpretations, regulations and other changes could adversely impact us.

Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control.

Certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law, as applicable to Maryland REITs, may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:

•

the REIT ownership limit described above;

•

authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers, preferences or rights to be determined by the Board of Trustees;

•

special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, by one-third of the trustees or by shareholders possessing no less than 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;

•

the Board of Trustees, without a shareholder vote, can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest, including the reclassification of common shares into preferred shares and vice-versa;

•

a two-thirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust; and

•

advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings.

In addition, if we elect to be governed by it in the future, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Law could delay or prevent a change in control. Under Maryland law, unless a REIT elects not to be subject to this law, “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the REIT. “Control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power. A “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares, with some exceptions.

Our bylaws state that the Maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares. This bylaw provision may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares, by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote, and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.



ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

General

As of

December 31, 2019

, we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-used properties which are operated as


predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately

23.7 million

square feet. These properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, California, and South Florida.

No

single commercial or residential property accounted for over 10% of our


total revenue. We believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies, with commercially reasonable exclusions, deductibles and limits.

Tenant Diversification

As of

December 31, 2019

, we had approximately

3,000

commercial leases and

2,700

residential leases, with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers. No one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than

2.6%

of our annualized base rent as of

December 31, 2019

. As a result of our tenant diversification, we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant, however, multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact.

Geographic Diversification

Our


real estate projects are located in


states and the District of Columbia. The following table shows the number of projects, the gross leasable area (“GLA”) of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of

December 31, 2019

.

(1)

Additionally, we own two participating mortgages totaling approximately

$30.4 million

secured by multiple buildings in Manayunk, Pennsylvania.

Leases, Lease Terms and Lease Expirations

Our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance, subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease, percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants, and reimbursement of a majority of on-site operating expenses and real estate taxes. These features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales.

Commercial property leases generally range from

three

to

ten

years; however, certain leases, primarily with anchor tenants, may be longer. Many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at pre-established rental rates that often include fixed rent increases, consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent. Leases on residential units are generally for a period of

one

year or less and, in


, represented approximately

9.1%

of total rental income.



The following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of

December 31, 2019

for each of the 10 years beginning with


and after


in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options. Annualized base rents reflect in-place contractual rents as of

December 31, 2019

.

During


, we signed leases for a total of

1,675,000

square feet of retail space including

1,557,000

square feet of comparable space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant) at an average rental increase of

8%

on a cash basis. New leases for comparable spaces were signed for

793,000

square feet at an average rental increase of

11%

on a cash basis. Renewals for comparable spaces were signed for

763,000

square feet at an average rental increase of

4%

on a cash basis. Tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were

$42.60

per square foot, of which,

$81.24

per square foot was for new leases and

$2.43

per square foot was for renewals in


.

During


, we signed leases for a total of

1,972,000

square feet of retail space including

1,874,000

square feet of comparable space leases (leases for which there was a prior tenant) at an average rental increase of

12%

on a cash basis. New leases for comparable spaces were signed for

796,000

square feet at an average rental increase of

25%

on a cash basis. Renewals for comparable spaces were signed for

1,078,000

square feet at an average rental increase of

4%

on a cash basis. Tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were

$27.09

per square foot, of which,

$61.02

per square foot was for new leases and

$2.02

per square foot was for renewals in


.

The rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed for retail space in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In atypical circumstances, management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total

dollars committed for the improvement (fit out) of a space as it relates to a specific lease and, except for redevelopments, may

also include base building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable.

Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements. Costs

related to redevelopments require judgment by management in determining what reflects base building costs and thus, is not

included in the "tenant improvements and incentives" amount.

The leases signed in


generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until


and beyond. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. However, these increases do provide information about the tenant/landlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time.

Historically, we have executed comparable space leases for 1.3 to 1.9 million square feet of retail space each year and expect the volume for


will be in line with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income. However,



changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels, if at all.



Retail and Residential Properties

The following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest, had a leasehold interest, or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of

December 31, 2019

. Except as otherwise noted, we are the sole owner of our real estate projects. Principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers.

PART II

ITEM 5.    MARKET FOR OUR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “FRT.” Listed below are the high and low sales prices of our common shares as reported on the New York Stock Exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated.

On

February 5, 2020

, there were 2,378 holders of record of our common shares.

Our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our REIT status and distribute to shareholders at least 100% of our taxable income. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least

90%

of taxable income.

Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Board of Trustees deems relevant. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for


consecutive years.

Our total annual dividends paid per common share for


and


were

$4.11

per share and

$4.02

per share, respectively. The annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes. Distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares, to the extent thereof, and thereafter as taxable capital gain. Distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain, or reducing the amount of loss, recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares. No assurances can be given regarding what portion, if any, of distributions in


or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. During a year in which a REIT earns a net long-term capital gain, the REIT can elect under Section 857(b)(3) of the Code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends. If this election is made, then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as long-term capital gains.

The following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders:

Distributions on our 5.417% Series 1 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares were paid at the rate of $1.354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of March 8, 2007. Distributions on our 5.0% Series C Cumulative Redeemable



Preferred Shares (which were issued September 29, 2017) were declared at the rate of $1.25 per depositary share per annum, and the first payment date was January 16, 2018. In


, dividends paid per depositary share were

$1.306

due to the timing of issuance. We do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of interest in our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.

Total Stockholder Return Performance

The following performance graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on Federal Realty's common shares with the S&P 500 Index and the index of equity real estate investment trusts prepared by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") for the five fiscal years commencing December 31, 2014, and ending

December 31, 2019

, assuming an investment of $100 and the reinvestment of all dividends into additional common shares during the holding period. Equity real estate investment trusts are defined as those that derive more than 75% of their income from equity investments in real estate assets. The FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Total Return Index includes all tax qualified real estate investment trusts listed on the NYSE, NYSE MKT, or the NASDAQ National Market. Stock performance for the past five years is not necessarily indicative of future results.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Shares

Under the terms of various operating partnership agreements of certain of our affiliated limited partnerships, the interest of limited partners in those limited partnerships may be redeemed, subject to certain conditions, for cash or an equivalent number of our common shares, at our option. During the three months ended

December 31, 2019

, we issued 17,035 common shares in connection with the redemption of operating partnership units. Such shares of common stock were issued in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Any other equity securities sold by us during


that were not registered have been previously reported in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

During


,

10,501

restricted common shares were forfeited by former employees.



From time to time, we could be deemed to have repurchased shares as a result of shares withheld for tax purposes upon a stock compensation related vesting event.



ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table includes certain financial information on a consolidated historical basis. You should read this section in conjunction with “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

(1)

Property operating income is a non-GAAP measure that consists of rental income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes. This measure is used internally to evaluate the performance of property operations and we consider it to be a significant measure. Property operating income should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The reconciliation of operating income to property operating income is as follows:



(2)

Funds from operations ("FFO") is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. We compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and we have historically reported our FFO available for common shareholders in addition to our net income.

We consider FFO available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of GAAP and the recording of depreciation. We use FFO primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other REITs. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. Additional information regarding our calculation of FFO is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

The reconciliation of net income to FFO available for common shareholders is as follows:

(3)  EBITDA for Real Estate ("EBITDAre") is a non-GAAP measure that NAREIT defines as: net income computed in accordance with GAAP plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate, impairments of real estate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. We calculate EBITDAre consistent with the NAREIT definition. As EBITDA is a widely known and understood measure of performance, management believes EBITDAre represents an additional non-GAAP performance measure, independent of a company's capital structure that will provide investors with a uniform basis to measure the enterprise value of a company. EBITDAre also approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants, but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The reconciliation of net income to EBITDAre for the periods presented is as follows:



(4)   Fixed charges consist of interest on borrowed funds (including capitalized interest), amortization of debt discount/ premiums and debt costs, costs related to the early extinguishment of debt, and the portion of rent expense representing an interest factor. Excluding the $11.9 million charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly Square Marketplace, our ratio of EBITDAre to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends remains 4.2x in 2019. Excluding the $12.3 million and $19.1 million early extinguishment of debt charge from fixed charges in 2017 and 2015, respectively, the ratio of EBITDAre to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends is 4.2x and 4.3x, for 2017 and 2015, respectively.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed “forward-looking statements”. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report for important information regarding these forward-looking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Overview

We are an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, California, and South Florida. As of

December 31, 2019

, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as


predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately

23.7 million

square feet. In total, the real estate projects were

94.2%

leased and

92.5%

occupied at

December 31, 2019

. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for


consecutive years.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as “GAAP”, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. In addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A discussion of possible risks which may



affect these estimates is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Policy beginning January 1, 2019, with our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, "Leases"

Our leases with our tenants are classified as operating leases. When collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is considered probable, the lease qualifies for accrual accounting. Lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease. Variable lease payments relating to percentage rent are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved.  Real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred. For a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. Lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date. When a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement.

When collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is not considered probable, total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash received. Determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during lease term requires judgment. This determination is impacted by numerous factors including our assessment of the tenant’s credit worthiness, economic conditions, our historical experience with the tenant and tenants operating in the same industry, and the length of the lease term. If leases currently classified as probable are subsequently reclassified as not probable, any outstanding lease receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) would be written-off with a corresponding decrease in rental income.  For example, in the event that our collectability determinations were not accurate and we were required to write off additional receivables equaling 1% of rental income, our rental income and net income would decrease by

$9.3 million

.

Policy prior to January 1, 2019

Prior to January 1, 2019, management estimates of collectability were considered when reserving for billed and accrued lease receivables and straight-line rent receivables.  Full and partial reserves were recorded when determined to be appropriate with a corresponding charge to bad debt expense. The primary impact of the adoption of ASC 842, “Leases,” on our recognition of lease revenue relates to the upfront and ongoing assessment of the collectability of substantially all lease payments required by the new standard.

Other revenue recognition policies

When we enter into a transaction to sell a property or a portion of a property, we evaluate the recognition of the sale under ASC 610-20, "Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets." In accordance with ASC 610-20, we apply the guidance in ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," to determine whether and when control transfers and how to measure the associated gain or loss. We determine the transaction price based on the consideration we expect to receive. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of a gain recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant gain reversal and if necessary limit the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk. The estimation of variable consideration requires us to make assumptions and apply significant judgment.

Real Estate

The nature of our business as an owner, redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixed-use properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital. Depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole. We capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives. We periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes, as necessary, to these estimates and, therefore, to our depreciation rates. These reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets, expected redevelopments, and general economic and real estate factors. Certain events, such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits, could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the



economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income. The longer the economic useful life, the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period, which in turn will increase our net income. Similarly, having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income.

Land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant work and other major improvements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years.

Capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease. Unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease. Undepreciated tenant work is written-off if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value. Additionally, we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed. If we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion, we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable.

Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. Generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period.

Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, and construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. We capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of

$352 million

and

$9 million

, respectively, for


and

$274 million

and

$8 million

, respectively, for


. We capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of

$80 million

and

$3 million

, respectively, for


and

$62 million

and

$3 million

, respectively, for


. We capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of

$24 million

and

$2 million

, respectively, for


and

$20 million

and

$6 million

, respectively, for


. The amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities, other property improvements, and leasing activities were

$8 million

,

$3 million

, and

$2 million

, respectively, for


and

$7 million

,

$3 million

, and

$6 million

, respectively, for


. Total capitalized costs were

$471 million

for


and

$373 million

for


, respectively.

Real Estate Acquisitions

Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land, building, improvements, leasing costs, intangibles such as in-place leases, assumed debt, and current assets and liabilities, if any.  Based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. We utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations. We consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of in-place lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options. If the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods, we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income.

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) and Consolidation

We have


entities that meet the criteria of a VIE and are consolidated. Net real estate assets related to VIEs included in our consolidated balance were approximately

$1.5 billion

for both

December 31, 2019

and


, and mortgage payables related to VIEs included in our consolidated balance sheets were approximately

$469.2 million

and

$444.4 million

, as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. In addition, we hold equity method investments in two hotel joint ventures and one shopping center which are considered variable interests in a VIE. VIEs are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a VIE has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.  The



determination of the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance requires judgment and is impacted by numerous factors including the purpose of the VIE, contractual rights and obligations of variable interest holders, and mechanisms for the resolution of disputes among the variable interest holders.

Long-Lived Assets and Impairment

There are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets, including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures. Management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as, in certain circumstances, undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis. Since most of our investments in real estate are wholly-owned or controlled assets which are held for use, a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows, including residual value, to the current net book value of the property. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value, the property is written down to expected fair value.

The calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. Because our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. Actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. These estimates have a direct impact on net income, because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income.

Contingencies

We are sometimes involved in lawsuits, warranty claims, and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters. We accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range, we accrue the best estimate within the range; however, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum within the range is accrued. Any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income.

Self-Insurance

We are self-insured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. We currently do not maintain third party stop-loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. Our accrual for self-insurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported. Management considers a number of factors, including third-party actuarial analysis, previous experience in our portfolio, and future increases in costs of claims, when making these determinations. If our liability costs differ from these accruals, it will increase or decrease our net income.

Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.


Property Acquisitions

(1) These acquisitions were completed through a newly formed joint venture, for which we own a 90% interest. This property includes


residential units in addition to the GLA in the table above.




Property Dispositions

On

December 11, 2019

,

we received

$154.7 million

in net proceeds related to the sale under the threat of condemnation of

11.7

acres of San Antonio Center to a local school district ("the condemning authority"). As part of the transaction, the condemning authority will commence condemnation proceedings in order to terminate all existing leases they assumed at closing. We have indemnified the condemning authority for all costs incurred related to the condemnation proceedings including any payments required to tenants at the property and expect the process will take several years to complete. The consideration in the transaction is considered variable because we have agreed to indemnify the condemning authority for these costs. Consequently, we have recorded a liability of

$45.5 million

to reflect our estimate of the final consideration, net of estimated condemnation proceeding costs and other transaction related costs. The resulting net gain on sale is approximately

$85.1 million

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we sold three properties and one land parcel for a net sales price of

$149.0 million

, which resulted in a net gain of

$28.3 million

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we closed on the sale of


condominium units at our Assembly Row and Pike & Rose properties (combined), received proceeds net of closing costs of

$20.1 million

, and recognized a gain of

$2.6 million

, net of income taxes. The cost basis for the remaining condominium units as of

December 31, 2019

is

$1.7 million

, and is included in "assets held for sale" on our consolidated balance sheets.


Significant Debt and Equity Transactions

On

January 31, 2019

, we repaid the

$20.3 million

mortgage loan on Rollingwood Apartments, at par, prior to its original maturity date.

On

June 7, 2019

, we issued

$300.0 million

of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on

June 15, 2029

and bear interest at

3.20%

. The notes were offered at

99.838%

of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of

3.219%

. On

August 21, 2019

, we issued an additional

$100.0 million

senior notes of the same series and with the same terms. The August notes were offered at

103.813%

of the principal amount, with a yield to maturity of

2.744%

. The combined net proceeds from the note offerings after net issuance premium, underwriting fees, and other costs were

$399.9 million

, which were primarily used to repay our

$275.0 million

unsecured term loan, at par, on

June 7, 2019

and for general corporate purposes.

On

July 25, 2019

, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity to

$1.0 billion

and extend the maturity date to January 19, 2024, plus two six-month extensions at our option. Under the amended facility, the spread over LIBOR is

77.5

basis points based on our current credit rating. In addition, we have an option (subject to bank approval) to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to $1.5 billion.

In connection with our Hoboken, New Jersey acquisitions in


, we assumed mortgage loans with a face amount of

$41.6 million

and a fair value of

$42.9 million

, and entered into a new mortgage loan with a face amount of

$56.5 million

. The mortgage loans associated with our Hoboken acquisitions have the following contractual terms:

_____________________

(1)

The interest rate is effectively fixed at

3.67%

as a result of two interest rate swap agreements.

(2)

The interest rates on these mortgages range from 3.91% to 5.00% and have maturity dates ranging from January 9, 2025 to May 31, 2029.

(3)

The interest rates on these mortgages range from 4.00% to 4.38% and have maturity dates ranging from October 1, 2025 to July 1, 2026.

On

August 2, 2019

, we acquired the

10.1%

redeemable noncontrolling interest in the partnership that owns our Montrose Crossing Shopping Center for

$10.0 million

, bringing our ownership interest to

100%

.

We have an at-the-market (“ATM”) equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to

$400.0 million

. We intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities, fund our development and redevelopment pipeline, repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and/or for general corporate purposes. For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we sold

1,069,699

common shares at a weighted average



price per share of

$134.71

for net cash proceeds of

$142.7 million

and paid

$1.2 million

in commissions and

$0.2 million

in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had the capacity to issue up to

$128.3 million

in common shares under our ATM equity program.

Outlook

We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following:

•

growth in our comparable property portfolio,

•

growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments, and

•

expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions.

Our comparable property growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals, changes in portfolio occupancy, and the redevelopment of those assets. Over the long-term, the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates. We continue to see relatively strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces; however, the time it takes to complete new lease deals is longer, as tenants have become more selective and more deliberate in their decision-making process. We have also experienced extended periods of time for some government agencies to process permits and inspections further delaying rent commencement on newly leased spaces. Additionally, we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces, and have seen an uptick in the number of retail tenants vacating prior to the end of their lease term and/or filing for bankruptcy. We believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment. However, any significant reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. At

December 31, 2019

, no single tenant accounted for more than

2.6%

of annualized base rent.

Our properties are located primarily in densely populated and/or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. We currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected cost of approximately $315 million that we expect to stabilize in the next several years.

We continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at Santana Row and are under construction on an eight story 301,000 square foot office building which will include an additional 20,000 square feet of retail space and 1,300 parking spaces. The building is expected to cost between $210 million and $220 million, to be delivered in 2020, and the office portion is 100% leased. After current phases, we have approximately 4 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 321,000 square feet of commercial space.

Additionally, we control 12 acres of land across from Santana Row, and we are proceeding with the first phase of construction on this land, which includes an eight story 376,000 square foot office building, with over 1,700 parking spaces. The building is expected to cost between $250 million and $270 million, with openings beginning in 2022. In addition, the land also has approximately 604,000 square feet of remaining commercial space entitlements.

Phase II of Assembly Row includes approximately 161,000 square feet of retail space, 447 residential units, and a 158 room boutique hotel (owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner). As of December 31, 2019, Phase II is substantially complete with expected final costs of $298 million to $302 million. Phase II also included 122 for-sale condominium units, which had a total cost of $81 million and have all have been sold as of December 31, 2019.

Additionally, we are under construction on Phase III of Assembly Row, which will include 277,000 square feet of office space (of which, 150,000 square feet is pre-leased), 56,000 square feet of retail space, 500 residential units, and over 800 additional parking spaces. The expected costs for Phase III are between $465 million and $485 million and is projected to open beginning in 2021.

Phase II of Pike & Rose includes approximately 219,000 square feet of retail space, 272 residential units, and a 177 room boutique hotel (owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner), and is substantially complete as of December 31, 2019. The total cost for this portion of Phase II was $208 million. As of December 31, 2019, we closed on the sale of 97 of the 99 for-sale condominium units in Phase II. The condominiums had a final cost of $62 million.

Additionally, at Pike & Rose, we commenced construction on a 212,000 square foot office building (which includes 4,000 square feet of ground floor retail space), and will include over 600 additional parking spaces. The building is expected to cost between $128 million and $135 million and is projected to open beginning in 2020.



We invested $258 million in Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, and Santana Row in


, net of public funding, and expect to invest between $320 million and $350 million in Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, and Santana Row in


.

The development of future phases of Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row will be pursued opportunistically based on, among other things, market conditions, tenant demand, and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return.

We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Initially, some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities, and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. We may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or downREIT units as well as through assumed mortgages and property sales.

At

December 31, 2019

, the leasable square feet in our properties was

94.2%

leased and

92.5%

occupied. The leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and, therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. Our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies.

Comparable Properties

Throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a “comparable property” basis. Information provided on a comparable property basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties that are currently under development or are being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. For the year ended

December 31, 2019

and the comparison of


and


, all or a portion of 95 properties were considered comparable properties and eight properties were considered non-comparable properties. For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, seven properties were moved from acquisitions to comparable properties, two properties were removed from comparable properties as they were sold during 2019, one property was moved from acquisitions to non-comparable properties, and one portion of a property was moved from non-comparable properties to comparable properties, compared to the designations as of

December 31, 2018

. While there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically move non-comparable properties to comparable properties once they have stabilized, which is typically considered 90% physical occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods. We typically remove properties from comparable properties when the repositioning of the asset has commenced and has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year.  Acquisitions are moved to comparable properties once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. Comparable property information replaces our previous same center designations.



YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2019

COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2018

(1) Property operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data for further discussion.

Property Revenues

Total property revenue increased

$20.4 million

, or

2.2%

, to

$935.8 million

in


compared to

$915.4 million

in


. The percentage occupied at our shopping centers was

92.5%

at

December 31, 2019

compared to

93.6%

at

December 31, 2018

. Changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.

Rental Income

Rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent. Rental income increased

$20.5 million

, or

2.2%

, to

$932.7 million

in


compared to

$912.3 million

in


due primarily to the following:

•

an increase of $14.9 million at comparable properties due primarily to higher rental rates of approximately $11.8 million, higher lease termination fees and legal fee income of $7.6 million, and higher average occupancy of approximately $2.8 million, partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in real estate tax recoveries primarily due to the requirements of the new lease accounting standard, and $2.5 million related to collectibility adjustments, which are now being presented as a reduction of rental income rather than rental expense (see Note 2 for additional disclosure)

•

an increase of $9.2 million at non-comparable properties due primarily to the opening of Phase II at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose partially offset by redevelopment related occupancy decreases at three properties, and

•

an increase of $3.9 million from acquisitions, primarily Fairfax Junction in February 2019, Hoboken during the second half of 2019, and Georgetowne Shopping Center in November 2019,

partially offset by

•

a decrease of $8.4 million from property sales.

Property Expenses

Total property expenses increased

$10.9 million

, or

3.8%

, to

$298.8 million

in


compared to

$287.9 million

in


. Changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.



Rental Expenses

Rental expenses increased

$14.7 million

, or

8.5%

, to

$187.8 million

in


compared to

$173.1 million

in


. This increase is primarily due to the following:

•

an $11.9 million charge in 2019 related to the buyout of a lease at Assembly Square Marketplace,

•

an increase of $1.9 million from comparable properties due primarily to a $5.2 million increase in repairs and maintenance costs partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in bad debt expense due to the new lease accounting standard requirement to record collectibility adjustments as a reduction to revenue rather than rental expense effective at adoption on January 1, 2019,

•

an increase of $1.2 million from non-comparable properties due primarily to the opening of Phase II at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, partially offset by lower expenses at two of our properties, and

•

an increase of $0.8 million from acquisitions,

partially offset by

•

a decrease of $1.4 million from property sales.

As a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above, rental expenses as a percentage of rental income increased to

20.1%

for the year ended December 31,


from

19.0%

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

Real Estate Taxes

Real estate tax expense decreased

$3.8 million

, or

3.4%

to

$110.9 million

in


compared to

$114.8 million

in


due primarily to the following:

•

a decrease of $3.2 million from comparable properties due primarily to the new lease accounting standard requirement, which no longer permits the gross up of real estate tax revenue and expense for real estate taxes that our tenants pay directly to the taxing authority (see Note 2 for additional disclosure) of $5.0 million and a tax refund from a multi-year appeal and reassessment for three of our properties, partially offset by higher assessments, and

•

a decrease of $1.8 million from property sales,

partially offset by

•

an increase of $0.7 million from acquisitions, and

•

an increase of $0.5 million at non-comparable properties due primarily to increases in assessments as a result of our redevelopment activities.

Property Operating Income

Property operating income increased

$9.5 million

, or

1.5%

, to

$637.0 million

in


compared to

$627.6 million

in


. This increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at comparable properties, the opening of Phase II at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, and our 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by the charge related to the buyout of a lease at Assembly Square Marketplace, and property sales.

Other Operating

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased

$9.2 million

, or

27.2%

, to

$42.8 million

in


from

$33.6 million

in


. This increase is due primarily to higher leasing related costs as certain costs can no longer be capitalized as a result of the new lease accounting standard (see Note 2 for additional disclosure) and higher personnel costs.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased

$4.5 million

, or

1.8%

, to

$239.8 million

in


from

$244.2 million

in


. This decrease is primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation related to tenants who vacated in advance of their lease expiration and property sales, partially offset by Phase II of Assembly Row and Pike & Rose being placed in service and our 2019 acquisitions.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net

The

$116.4 million

gain on sale of real estate, net for the year ended December 31 2019 is primarily due to the following:

•

$85.1 million

related to the sale under the threat of condemnation of

11.7

acres of San Antonio Center,



•

$28.3 million

related to the sale of three properties and one land parcel,

•

$2.6 million

net gain related to condominium unit sales that have closed at our Assembly Row and Pike & Rose properties.

The

$11.9 million

gain on sale of real estate, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to the following:

•

$7.2 million net gain related to condominium unit sales that have closed at our Assembly Row and Pike & Rose properties,

•

$4.7 million gain related to the sale of one property and the residential building at another one of our properties

Operating Income

Operating income increased

$109.3 million

, or

30.2%

, to

$470.9 million

in


compared to

$361.6 million

in


. This increase is due primarily to higher gains on the sale of real estate in 2019, growth in earnings at our comparable properties, and the opening of Phase II of Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, partially offset by the charge related to the buyout of a lease at Assembly Square Marketplace, higher leasing and personnel related costs, and property sales.

Other

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased

$0.5 million

, or

0.5%

, to

$109.6 million

in


compared to

$110.2 million

in


. This decrease is due primarily to a $1.6 million increase in capitalized interest partially offset by a $1.1 million increase due to a higher weighted average borrowing rate in 2019.

Gross interest costs were

$130.1 million

and

$129.0 million

in


and


, respectively. Capitalized interest was

$20.5 million

and

$18.8 million

in


and


, respectively.

Loss from Partnerships

Loss from partnerships decreased to

$2.0 million

in


compared to

$3.4 million

in


. This decrease is due primarily to improved operating results at our Assembly Row and Pike & Rose hotel joint ventures, which opened in August 2018 and March 2018, respectively.

Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2018

filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Due to the nature of our business and strategy, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends. As a REIT, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least

90%

of our taxable income.

Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses, obligations under our capital and operating leases, regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt, as well as scheduled debt maturities), recurring expenditures, non-recurring expenditures (such as tenant improvements and redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. Our long-term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our long-term debt agreements, development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions.

We intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. In the short and long term, we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity, unsecured and/or secured debt financings, joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions, and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure.

At

December 31, 2019

, we had cash and cash equivalents of

$127.4 million

and

no

outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility. For the year ended


, the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was

$116.5 million

, the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was

$26.8 million

, and the weighted average interest rate, before amortization of debt fees, was

3.2%

.

On June 7, 2019, we issued $300.0 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on June 15, 2029 and bear interest at 3.20%. On August 21, 2019, we issued an additional $100.0 million senior notes of the same series and with the same terms.



The combined net proceeds of $399.9 million were primarily used to repay our $275.0 million unsecured term loan, which was scheduled to mature in November 2019. During 2020, we have only $60.6 million of debt maturing.

On July 25, 2019, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity from $800.0 million to $1.0 billion, lower our spread over LIBOR from 82.5 basis points to 77.5 basis points, and extend the maturity date to January 19, 2024, plus two six-month extensions at our option. In addition,we have an option (subject to bank approval) to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to $1.5 billion.

During 2019, we raised

$142.7 million

under our ATM equity program after fees and other costs, and as of

December 31, 2019

, we had the capacity to issue up to

$128.3 million

in common shares under the ATM program. We currently believe that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our ATM program, our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures.

Our overall capital requirements during


will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row. While the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment, as we continue to invest in the next phase of these projects. With respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties, we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years. Our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash flow from operations, cash on hand and/or our revolving credit facility, and on a long-term basis, with long-term debt or equity including shares issued under our ATM equity program. If necessary, we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions. Given our past ability to access the capital markets, we expect debt or equity to be available to us. Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy.

In addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets, the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements:

•

restrictions in our debt instruments or preferred shares may limit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at all, or on acceptable terms under then-prevailing market conditions; and

•

we may be unable to service additional or replacement debt due to increases in interest rates or a decline in our operating performance.

Summary of Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased

$54.8 million

to

$461.9 million

during


from

$516.7 million

during


. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $14.5 million lease buyout payment at Assembly Square Marketplace in August 2019, $12.4 million in net proceeds in 2018 from the Freedom Plaza new market tax credit transaction (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion), and the timing of cash receipts.

Net cash used in investing activities increased

$124.3 million

to

$316.5 million

during


from

$192.2 million

during


. The increase was primarily attributable to:

•

a $191.0 million increase in acquisitions of real estate, primarily due to the acquisitions of Georgetowne Shopping Center, 37 mixed-use buildings in Hoboken, New Jersey, and Fairfax Junction in 2019,

•

a $41.7 million increase in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in Pike & Rose, Assembly Row, Santana Row and other redevelopments, and

•

$38.0 million in proceeds from our Assembly Row hotel joint venture formation in 2018,



partially offset by

•

a $144.2 million increase in proceeds from sales of real estate, resulting from the sale under the threat of condemnation of a portion of San Antonio Center in December 2019 and the sale of three additional properties in 2019 compared to two properties in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of condominiums at our Assembly Row and Pike & Rose properties.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased

$141.2 million

to

$100.1 million

during


from

$241.3 million

during


. The decrease was primarily attributable to:

•

$399.9 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $300.0 million of 3.20% senior unsecured notes in June 2019 and an additional $100.0 million of the same series in August 2019,

•

$41.0 million of repayments on our revolving credit facility in 2018 partially offset by $4.0 million of costs related to the July 2019 amendment, and

•

a $12.1 million increase in net proceeds from the issuance of

1.1 million

common shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price of

$134.71

during 2019, as compared to 1.0 million common shares at a weighted average price of $129.19 in 2018,

partially offset by

•

a $284.4 million increase in repayment of mortgages, finance leases, and notes payable primarily due to the payoff of our $275.0 million unsecured term loan in June 2019 and the $20.3 million payoff of the mortgage loan on Rollingwood Apartments in January 2019, as compared to the $10.5 million payoff of the mortgage loan on the Grove at Shrewsbury (West) in March 2018, and

•

a $12.5 million increase in dividends paid to shareholders due to an increase in the common share dividend rate and an increase in the number of common shares outstanding.

Contractual Commitments

The following table provides a summary of our fixed, noncancelable obligations as of

December 31, 2019

:

_____________________

(1)

Fixed rate debt includes a

$56.5 million

mortgage loan that has a rate that is effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements.

(2)

Variable rate debt includes our revolving credit facility, which bears interest at

LIBOR + 0.775%

and had

no

balance outstanding at

December 31, 2019

.

In addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed, the following potential commitments exist:

(a) Under the terms of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement, a minority partner has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its

26.63%

interest in Congressional Plaza at the interest’s then-current fair market value. If the other minority partner defaults in their obligation, we must purchase the full interest. Based on management’s current



estimate of fair market value as of

December 31, 2019

, our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately

$79 million

to

$84 million

.

(b) Under the terms of various other partnership agreements, the partners have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for cash or the same number of our common shares, at our option. As of

December 31, 2019

, a total of

609,584

operating partnership units are outstanding.

(c)

Two

of the members in Plaza El Segundo have the right to require us to purchase their

10.0%

and

11.8%

ownership interests at the interests' then-current fair market value. If the members fail to exercise their put options, we have the right to purchase each of their interests on or after December 30, 2026 at fair market value.  Based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of

December 31, 2019

, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately

$30 million

to

$33 million

.

(d) The other member in The Grove at Shrewsbury and Brook 35 has the right to require us to purchase all of its approximately

4.1%

interest in The Grove at Shrewsbury and approximately

6.5%

interest in Brook 35 at the interests' then-current fair market value. Based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of

December 31, 2019

, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from

$7 million

to

$8 million

.

(e) Effective September 18, 2023, the other member in Hoboken has the right to require us to purchase all of its

10%

ownership interest at the interest's then-current fair market value. Based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of

December 31, 2019

, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from

$9 million

to

$10 million

.

(f) At

December 31, 2019

, we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately

$4.3 million

.

(g) In connection with our sale under the threat of condemnation of a portion of San Antonio Center, we agreed to indemnify the condemning authority for costs including any payments required to be paid to tenants at the property, in connection with the actual condemnation. We expect the condemnation process to take several years and estimate these costs to be approximately

$45.5 million

.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At

December 31, 2019

, we have three real estate related equity method investments with total debt outstanding of $111.1 million, of which our share is $54.0 million. Our investment in these ventures at

December 31, 2019

was

$23.4 million

.

Other than the items disclosed in the Contractual Commitments Table, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of

December 31, 2019

that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.



Debt Financing Arrangements

The following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

:

_____________________

1)

On November 26, 2019, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest rate on the mortgage loan at

3.67%

.

2)

This mortgage loan has a fixed interest rate, however, the rate resets every five years until maturity. The current interest rate is fixed until July 1, 2022, and the loan is prepayable at par anytime after this date.

3)

The interest rates on these mortgages range from 3.91% to 5.00%.

4)

The maximum amount drawn under our revolving credit facility during


was

$116.5 million

and the weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility, before amortization of debt fees, was

3.2%

.



Our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. As of

December 31, 2019

, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility and senior notes. Additionally, as of

December 31, 2019

, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger loan default on our mortgage loans. If we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. Many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares. Our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur.

The following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of

December 31, 2019

The total debt maturities differ from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized net premium/discount and debt issuance costs on mortgage loans, notes payable, and senior notes as of

Interest Rate Hedging

We may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. We generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. We enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.

Interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet and statement of shareholders' equity. Cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and LIBOR rate. In addition, the default risk of the counterparty is evaluated by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. If a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.

During


, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a mortgage payable associated with our Hoboken acquisition at

3.67%

. Our Assembly Row hotel joint venture is also a party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the joint venture's mortgage debt at

5.206%

. All swaps were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted our earnings in


,


and


.

REIT Qualification

We intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the Code, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders.



Funds From Operations

Funds from operations (“FFO”) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. We compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and we have historically reported our FFO available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. It should be noted that FFO:

•

does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income);

•

should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and

•

is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.

We consider FFO available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of GAAP and the recording of depreciation. We use FFO primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other REITs. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.

An increase or decrease in FFO available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our Board of Trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain REIT status. However, we must distribute at least

90%

of our taxable income to remain qualified as a REIT. Therefore, a significant increase in FFO will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis.

The reconciliation of net income to FFO available for common shareholders is as follows:

_____________________

(1)

For the year ended December 31, 2019, FFO available for common shareholders includes an $11.9 million charge relating to the buyout of a lease at Assembly Square Marketplace. If this charge was excluded, our FFO available for common shareholders for 2019 would have been $477.7 million, and FFO available for common shareholders, per diluted share would have been $6.33. For the year ended December 31, 2017, FFO available for common shareholders includes a $12.3 million charge related to early extinguishment of debt. If this charge was excluded, our FFO available for common shareholders for 2017 would have been $432.2 million, and FFO available for common shareholders, per diluted share would have been $5.91.



(2)

The weighted average common shares used to compute FFO per diluted common share also includes operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. Conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of FFO per diluted common share but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted EPS for the periods presented.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our use of financial instruments, such as debt instruments, subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows, as well as the fair value of our assets. Market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices. We manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating, investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments, dividends to common and preferred shareholders, investments, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.

We may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk. We use interest rate protection and swap agreements, for example, to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. We use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

The following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt, including our fixed-rate debt. Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. Quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. This analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt, such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change. This analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.

Fixed Interest Rate Debt

The majority of our outstanding debt obligations (maturing at various times through 2046 or, with respect to finance lease obligations through 2106) have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates. However, interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments. At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$3.4 billion

of fixed-rate debt outstanding, including

$56.5 million

in mortgage payables that are effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements. If market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixed-rate debt instruments at

December 31, 2019

had been

1.0%

higher, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately

$250.5 million

. If market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixed-rate debt instruments at

December 31, 2019

had been

1.0%

lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately

$288.1 million

.

Variable Interest Rate Debt

Generally, we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2019, we had no variable rate debt outstanding.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Trust’s



management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Our management, with the participation of the Trust’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures as of

December 31, 2019

. Based on that evaluation, the Trust’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of

December 31, 2019

, the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Trust’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Trust’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Trustees, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of our assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and our Trustees; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of any of our assets in circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We assessed the effectiveness of the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

. Based on that assessment and criteria, management concluded that the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

Grant Thornton LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Trust's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Trust's internal control over financial reporting, which appears on page

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter of


that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Trustees and Shareholders

Federal Realty Investment Trust

Opinion on internal control over financial reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Federal Realty Investment Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) and Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Trust") as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in the 2013

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). In our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in the 2013

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Trust as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, and our report dated

February 10, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for opinion

The Trust’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Trustees and Shareholders

Federal Realty Investment Trust

Opinion on the financial statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Federal Realty Investment Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) and Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Trust") as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes and financial statement schedules included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of

December 31, 2019

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2019

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in the 2013

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated

February 10, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion.

Change in accounting principle

As dicussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Trust has changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases.

Basis for opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical audit matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Adoption of ASC 842 (Lessee) - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements

The Trust adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842) as of January 1, 2019, which, from a lessee perspective, resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and a lease liability for operating leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability is equal to the present value of future lease payments and the asset is based on the liability, subject to certain adjustments, including initial direct costs.

We identified the adoption of ASC 842, from a lessee perspective, as a critical audit matter because it is a substantial change in accounting for leases and as such requires significant auditor judgment in obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence

F-3


related to management’s determination of the lease liability and ROU asset and their selection of a discount rate to be applied to future lease payments.

Our audit procedures related to the adoption of ASC 842 included the following:

•

We assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to the initial adoption of ASC 842.

•

We verified the completeness of the population of leases that management evaluated as part of the initial adoption and ongoing accounting for leases in future periods.

•

We inspected a sample of lease contracts, compared the relevant inputs in management’s calculation to underlying lease documents, and recalculated the related ROU asset and lease liability.

•

We utilized a specialist to evaluate the discount rate used in the initial measurement of the lease liability upon adoption, including the appropriateness of the methodology employed to determine the discount rate and the final conclusion reached.

•

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the cumulative catch up adjustment recognized upon adoption.

•

We evaluated the new accounting policy for leases where the Trust is the lessee.

Adoption of ASC 842 (Lessor) - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements

The Trust adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019, which, from a lessor perspective, resulted in a change to the Trust’s revenue recognition policy for revenue earned under operating leases with their tenants.

We identified the adoption of ASC 842, from a lessor perspective, as a critical audit matter because significant auditor judgment was required in evaluating whether management had appropriately interpreted and implemented this new accounting standard for leases that were in place on the adoption date and for new leases entered into subsequent to the adoption date.

Our audit procedures related to the adoption of ASC 842 included the following:

•

We assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to the initial adoption of ASC 842.

•

We evaluated the transition method implemented for leases that were in place at the adoption date and the new accounting policy for revenue earned under operating leases with their tenants. We utilized specialists in these evaluations.

•

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the cumulative catch up adjustment recognized upon adoption.

NOTE 1—

BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

Federal Realty Investment Trust (the “Trust”) is an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of retail and mixed-use properties. Our properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States, California, and South Florida. As of

December 31, 2019

, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as


predominantly retail real estate projects.

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. A REIT that distributes at least


%

of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.

NOTE


—

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust, its corporate subsidiaries, and all entities in which the Trust has a controlling interest or has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The equity interests of other investors are reflected as noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. We account for our interests in joint ventures, which we do not control, using the equity method of accounting. Certain


and


amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as “GAAP,” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past, current and expected events and economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Policy beginning January 1, 2019, with our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, "Leases"

Our leases with our tenants are classified as operating leases. When collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is considered probable, the lease qualifies for accrual accounting. Lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease. Variable lease payments relating to percentage rent are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved.  Real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred. For a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. Lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date. When a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement.

When collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is not considered probable, total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash received. Determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during lease term requires judgment. This determination is impacted by numerous factors including our assessment of the tenant’s credit worthiness, economic conditions, our historical experience with the tenant and tenants operating in the same industry, and the length of the lease term. If leases currently classified as probable are subsequently reclassified as not probable, any outstanding lease receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) would be written-off with a corresponding decrease in rental income.

Policy prior to January 1, 2019

Prior to January 1, 2019, management estimates of collectability were considered when reserving for billed and accrued lease receivables and straight-line rent receivables.  Full and partial reserves were recorded when determined to be appropriate with a

F-9


corresponding charge to bad debt expense. The primary impact of the adoption of ASC 842, “Leases,” on our recognition of lease revenue relates to the upfront and ongoing assessment of the collectability of substantially all lease payments required by the new standard.

Other revenue recognition policies

In 2018, we completed construction on


condominium units at our Assembly Row and Pike & Rose properties. Beginning on January 1, 2018, with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," gains or losses on the sale of these condominium units are recognized as the condominium units are legally sold. In 2017, we accounted for contracted condominium sales under the percentage-of completion method, based on an evaluation of the criteria specified in ASC Topic 360-20, “Property, Plant and Equipment – Real Estate Sales,” including: the legal commitment of the purchaser in the real estate contract, whether the construction of the project was beyond a preliminary phase, whether sufficient units had been contracted to ensure the project would not revert to a rental project, the ability to reasonably estimate the aggregate project sale proceeds and aggregate project costs, and the determination that the buyer had made an adequate initial and continuing cash investment under the contract. When the percentage-of-completion criteria had not been met, no profit was recognized. The application of these criteria can be complex and required us to make assumptions.

When we enter into a transaction to sell a property or a portion of a property, we evaluate the recognition of the sale under ASC 610-20, "Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets." In accordance with ASC 610-20, we apply the guidance in ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," to determine whether and when control transfers and how to measure the associated gain or loss. We determine the transaction price based on the consideration we expect to receive. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of a gain recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant gain reversal and if necessary limit the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk. The estimation of variable consideration requires us to make assumptions and apply significant judgment.

Real Estate

Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range generally from


years to a maximum of


years on buildings and major improvements. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from


to


years. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the undepreciated balance of any tenant improvements are written off if they are replaced or have no future value. In


,


and


, real estate depreciation expense was

$

215.4

million

,

$

216.0

million

and

$

193.3

million

, respectively, including amounts from real estate sold.

Effective January 1, 2018, (upon the adoption of ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," as amended and interpreted) sales of real estate are recognized generally upon the transfer of control, which usually occurs when the real estate is legally sold. Prior to January 1, 2018, sales of real estate were recognized only when sufficient down payments had been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership had been transferred to the buyer and we had no significant continuing involvement. The application of these criteria can be complex and required us to make assumptions. We believe the relevant criteria were met for all real estate sold during the periods presented.

Our methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values, replacement cost and/or appraised values. When we acquire operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated to land, building, improvements, leasing costs, intangibles such as in-place leases, assumed debt, if any, and to current assets and liabilities acquired, if any. The value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of in-place lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options. If the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods, we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income.

Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions, such as broker fees, transfer taxes, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional and consulting fees, are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost. The acquisition of an operating shopping center typically qualifies as an asset acquisition.

F-10


Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, "Leases," when applicable, as lessee, we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases. We are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term, the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease. Subsequently, capital leases are now considered "finance leases," see "Recent Accounting Pronouncements," for an explanation of the impact to our consolidated balance sheet.

We capitalize certain costs related to the development and redevelopment of real estate including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. Additionally, we capitalize interest costs related to development and redevelopment activities. Capitalization of these costs begin when the activities and related expenditures commence and cease when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use at which time the project is placed in service and depreciation commences. Additionally, we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed. If we determine the development or redevelopment is no longer probable of completion, we expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable.

We review for impairment on a property by property basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount, at which time, the property is written-down to fair value. Properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We define cash and cash equivalents as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short term liquid investments with an initial maturity, when purchased, under

three

months. Cash balances in individual banks may exceed the federally insured limit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$

131.5

million

in excess of the FDIC insured limit.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets

Prepaid expenses and other assets consist primarily of lease costs, prepaid property taxes and acquired above market leases. Capitalized lease costs are incremental direct costs incurred which were essential to originate a successful leasing arrangement and would not have been incurred had the leasing transaction not taken place. Capitalized lease costs are amortized over the life of the related lease. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any previously capitalized lease costs are written off.

Debt Issuance Costs

Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are deferred and are amortized as interest expense over the estimated life of the related issue using the straight-line method which approximates the effective interest method. If a debt instrument is paid off prior to its original maturity date, the unamortized balance of debt issuance costs are written off to interest expense or, if significant, included in “early extinguishment of debt.”

Debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit facility are classified as an asset and are included in "prepaid expenses and other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets. All other debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability.

Derivative Instruments

We may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. We generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. We enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.

Interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet and statement of shareholders' equity. Cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and LIBOR rate. In addition, the default risk of the counterparty is evaluated by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. If a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.

During

two

interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a mortgage payable associated with our Hoboken acquisition at

December 31, 2019

, our Assembly Row hotel joint venture is a party to

two

interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the joint venture's mortgage debt at

5.206

%

. Both swaps were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in

Mortgage Notes Receivable

We have made certain mortgage loans that, because of their nature, qualify as loan receivables. At the time the loans were made, we did not intend for the arrangement to be anything other than a financing and did not contemplate a real estate investment. We evaluate each investment to determine whether the loan arrangement qualifies as a loan, joint venture or real estate investment and the appropriate accounting thereon. Such determination affects our balance sheet classification of these investments and the recognition of interest income derived therefrom. We receive additional interest, however, we never receive in excess of


%

of the residual profit in the project, and because the borrower has either a substantial investment in the project or has guaranteed all or a portion of our loan (or a combination thereof), the loans qualify for loan accounting. The amounts under these arrangements are presented as mortgage notes receivable at

December 31, 2019

and


.

Mortgage notes receivable are recorded at cost, net of any valuation adjustments. Interest income is accrued as earned. Mortgage notes receivable are considered past due based on the contractual terms of the note agreement. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the collectability of each mortgage note receivable based on various factors which may include payment history, expected fair value of the collateral securing the loan, internal and external credit information and/or economic trends. A loan is considered impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the mortgage note receivable to the present value of expected future cash flows. Since our loans are collateralized by a first mortgage, the loans have risk characteristics similar to the risks in owning commercial real estate.

At

December 31, 2019

and


, we had

two

mortgage notes receivable, with aggregate carrying amounts of

$

30.4

million

, and weighted average interest rates of

10.0

%

and

10.3

%

, respectively, which were secured by first mortgages on retail buildings.

Share Based Compensation

We grant share based compensation awards to employees and trustees typically in the form of restricted common shares, common shares, and options. We measure share based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. See Note


for further discussion regarding our share based compensation plans and policies.

Variable Interest Entities

Certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest qualify as VIEs. VIEs are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Our equity method investments in the Pike & Rose hotel joint venture, the Assembly Row hotel joint venture, and the La Alameda shopping center are also considered variable interests in a VIE. As we do not control the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the joint ventures, we are not the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, our investment in these joint ventures and maximum exposure to loss was

$

23.4

million

and

$

26.9

million

, respectively.

In addition, we have


entities that meet the criteria of a VIE in which we hold a variable interest. For each of these entities, we control the significant operating decisions and consequently have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities. As we also have the obligation to absorb the majority of the losses and/or the right to receive a majority of the benefits for each of these entities, all are consolidated in our financial statements. Net real estate assets related to VIEs included in our consolidated balance sheets were approximately

$

1.5

billion

for both

December 31, 2019

and


, and mortgages related to VIEs included in our consolidated balance sheets were approximately

$

469.2

million

and

$

444.4

million

, as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

F-12


We have also evaluated our mortgage notes receivable investments and determined that the entities obligated under the mortgage notes are not VIEs. Our equity method investments and mortgage notes receivable balances are presented separately in our consolidated balance sheets.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

We have certain noncontrolling interests that are redeemable for cash upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely in our control and therefore are classified outside of permanent equity. We adjust the carrying amounts of these noncontrolling interests that are currently redeemable to redemption value at the balance sheet date.  Adjustments to the carrying amount to reflect changes in redemption value are recorded as adjustments to additional paid-in capital in shareholders' equity. These amounts are classified within the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table provides a rollforward of the redeemable noncontrolling interests:

On

August 2, 2019

, we acquired the

10.1

%

redeemable noncontrolling interest in the partnership that owns our Montrose Crossing Shopping Center for

$

10.0

million

, bringing our ownership interest to


%

.

Income Taxes

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. A REIT that distributes at least


%

of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Therefore, federal income taxes on our taxable income have been and are generally expected to be immaterial. We are obligated to pay state taxes, generally consisting of franchise or gross receipts taxes in certain states. Such state taxes also have not been material.

We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, which we refer to as a TRS. In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. Our TRS activities have not been material.

With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before


. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, we had

no

material unrecognized tax benefits. While we currently have

no

material unrecognized tax benefits, as a policy, we recognize penalties and interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

Segment Information

Our primary business is the ownership, management, and redevelopment of retail and mixed-use properties. We review operating and financial information for each property on an individual basis and therefore, each property represents an individual operating segment. We evaluate financial performance using property operating income, which consists of rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes.

No

individual commercial or residential property constitutes more than

10% of our revenues or property operating income

and we have no operations outside of the United States of America. Therefore, we have aggregated our properties into

one

reportable segment as the properties share similar long-term economic characteristics and have other similarities including the fact that they are operated using consistent business strategies, are typically located in major metropolitan areas, and have similar tenant mixes.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows—Supplemental Disclosures

The following table provides supplemental disclosures related to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

(1) See Note 5 for additional disclosures relating to the mortgages entered into and assumed as a result of the Hoboken acquisition in 2019. In addition, see Note 3 for additional disclosures relating to our investment in the Assembly Row hotel joint venture in 2018.

Capitalized lease costs are incremental direct costs incurred which were essential to originate a lease and would not have been incurred had the leasing transaction not taken place. These costs include third party commissions related to obtaining a lease. Capitalized lease costs are amortized over the initial term of the related lease which generally ranges from

three

to

ten

years. We view these lease costs as part of the up-front initial investment we made in order to generate a long-term cash inflow

F-16


and therefore, we classify cash outflows related to leasing costs as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. See the "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" section in this note for further discussion regarding the change in accounting for lease costs as well as the operating lease right of use assets and lease liabilities recorded in connection with our adoption of ASC Topic 842.

2019 Property Dispositions

On

, w

e received

$

154.7

million

in net proceeds related to the sale under the threat of condemnation of

11.7

acres of San Antonio Center to a local school district ("the condemning authority"). As part of the transaction, the condemning authority will commence condemnation proceedings in order to terminate all existing leases they assumed at closing. We have indemnified the condemning authority for all costs incurred related to the condemnation proceedings including any payments required to tenants at the property and expect the process will take several years to complete. The consideration in the transaction is considered variable because we have agreed to indemnify the condemning authority for these costs. Consequently, we have recorded a liability of

$

45.5

million

to reflect our estimate of the final consideration, net of estimated condemnation proceeding costs and other transaction related costs. The resulting net gain on sale is approximately

$

85.1

million

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we sold three properties and one land parcel for a net sales price of

$

149.0

million

, which resulted in a net gain of

$

28.3

million

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

2018 Property Acquisitions and Dispositions

On

June 15, 2018

, we formed a new joint venture to develop Freedom Plaza (formerly known as Jordan Downs Plaza) which, when completed, will be an approximately

113,000

square foot grocery anchored shopping center located in Los Angeles County, California. We initially invested

$

34.4

million

as a result of a pre-funding requirement for equity to be advanced prior to the start of construction. We own approximately


%

of the venture, and control the

9.4

acre land parcel on which the shopping center will be constructed under a long-term ground lease that expires

June 15, 2093

(including two 10-year option periods which may be exercised at our option). The Freedom Plaza development is expected to generate income tax credits under the New Market Tax Credit Program ("NMTC") which was provided for in the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 ("the Act") and is intended to induce investment in underserved areas of the United States. The Act permits taxpayers to claim credits against their Federal income taxes for qualified investments. A third party bank contributed

$

13.9

million

to the development, and is entitled to the related tax credit benefits, but they do not have an interest in the underlying economics of the property. The transaction also includes a put/call provision whereby we may be obligated or entitled to purchase the third party bank’s interest. We believe the put will be exercised at its

$

1,000

strike price. Based on our assessment of control, we concluded that the project and certain other transaction related entities should be consolidated. The

$

13.9

million

in proceeds received in exchange for the transfer of the tax credits has been deferred and will be recognized when the tax benefits are delivered to the third party bank without risk of recapture. Direct and incremental costs of

$

1.6

million

incurred in structuring the NMTC transaction have also been deferred. The Trust anticipates recognizing the net cash received as revenue upon completion of the seven-year NMTC compliance period. Cash in escrow at

December 31, 2019

of

$

12.6

million

, reflects remaining cash that will ultimately be used for the development of the shopping center, and is included in "prepaid expenses and other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. The cash is held in escrow pursuant to the new market tax credit transaction documents and will be released as qualified development expenditures are incurred.

In

August 2018

, we contributed hotel related assets valued at

$

44.0

million

to our Assembly Row hotel joint venture, and received a cash distribution of

$

38.0

million

. At

December 31, 2019

, our investment in the venture was

$

3.2

million

. The joint venture is considered a variable interest entity controlled by our partner, and as a result, we are using the equity method to account for our investment.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold two properties for a net sales price of

$

42.2

million

, which resulted in a net gain of

$

4.7

million

.

On

November 29, 2018

, we acquired a

40,000

square foot building adjacent to our Bell Gardens property for

$

9.6

During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, we closed on the sale of


condominium units at our Assembly Row and Pike & Rose properties (combined) and received proceeds net of closing costs of

$

133.5

million

, For the year ended

December 31, 2018

, we recognized a gain of

$

7.2

NOTE


—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A fair value measurement is based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in an orderly transaction. The hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value are as follows:

1.

Level 1 Inputs—quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

2.

Level 2 Inputs—observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities

3.

Level 3 Inputs—prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Except as disclosed below, the carrying amount of our financial instruments approximates their fair value. The fair value of our mortgages payable, notes payable and senior notes and debentures is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. Quoted market prices (Level 1) were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis (Level 2) is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. The estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.

A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of our mortgages payable, notes payable and senior notes and debentures is as follows:

During


, we entered into

two

interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of

$

56.5

million

that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The interest rate swap agreements fix the interest rate on

$

56.5

million

of mortgage payables associated with our Hoboken acquisition at

3.67

%

through

December 15, 2029

. The fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are based on the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date and are determined using interest rate pricing models and interest rate related observable inputs. The fair value of our swaps at

December 31, 2019

was an asset of

$

0.1

million

and is included in "prepaid expenses and other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet. During


, we reclassified less than

$

0.1

million

from other comprehensive income as an increase to interest expense.

A summary of our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level within the fair value hierarchy is as follows:

One of our equity method investees has two interest rate swaps which qualify as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our share of the decrease in fair value of the related swaps included in "accumulated other comprehensive loss" was

$

0.9

million

and

$

0.4

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are sometimes involved in lawsuits, warranty claims, and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters.

We are currently a party to various legal proceedings. We accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range, we accrue the best estimate within the range; however, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum within the range is accrued. Legal fees related to litigation are expensed as incurred. Other than as described below, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations; however, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Also under our leases, tenants are typically obligated to indemnify us from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses imposed upon or asserted against us (1) as owner of the properties due to certain matters relating to the operation of the properties by the tenant, and (2) where appropriate, due to certain matters relating to the ownership of the properties prior to their acquisition by us.

We are self-insured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. We currently do not maintain third party stop-loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. Our accrual for self-insurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Management considers a number of factors, including third-party actuarial analysis, previous experience in our portfolio, and future increases in costs of claims, when making these determinations. If our liability costs exceed these accruals, it will reduce our net income.

We reserve for estimated losses, if any, associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time real estate is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale, taking any insurance policies into account. These warranties may extend up to

ten

years and require significant judgment. If changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated, we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed.

At

December 31, 2019

and


, our reserves for general liability costs were

$

3.0

million

and

$

3.1

million

, respectively, and are included in “accounts payable and accrued expenses” in our consolidated balance sheets. Any potential losses which exceed our estimates would result in a decrease in our net income. During


and


, we made payments from these reserves of

$

1.3

million

and

$

1.4

million

, respectively. Although we consider the reserve to be adequate, there can be no assurance that the reserve will prove to be adequate over-time to cover losses due to the difference between the assumptions used to estimate the reserve and actual losses.

At

December 31, 2019

, we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately

$

4.3

million

.

As of

December 31, 2019

26.63

%

interest in Congressional Plaza at the interest’s then-current fair market value. If the other minority partner defaults in their obligation, we must purchase the full interest. Based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of

December 31, 2019

, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately

$


million

to

$


million

%

ownership interests at the interests' then-current fair market value. If the members fail to exercise their put options, we have the right to purchase each of their interests on or after December 30, 2026 at fair market value. Based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of

December 31, 2019

, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately

$


million

to

$


million

4.1

%

interest in The Grove at Shrewsbury and approximately

6.5

%

interest in Brook 35 at the interests' then-current fair market value. Based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of

$


million

.

Effective September 18, 2023, the other member in Hoboken has the right to require us to purchase all of its

10.0

%

ownership interest at the interest's then-current fair market value. Based on management's current estimate of fair market value as of

December 31, 2019

, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from

$


million

to

$


million

OPERATING LEASES

At

December 31, 2019

, our


predominantly retail shopping center and mixed-use properties are located in


states and the District of Columbia. There are approximately

3,000

commercial leases and

2,700

residential leases. Our commercial tenants range from sole proprietorships to national retailers and corporations. At

December 31, 2019

, no one tenant or corporate group of tenants accounted for more than

2.6

%

of annualized base rent.

Our leases with commercial property and residential tenants are classified as operating leases. Commercial property leases generally range from three to ten years (certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer), and in addition to minimum rents, may provide for percentage rents based on the tenant’s level of sales achieved and cost recoveries for the tenant’s share of certain operating costs. Leases on apartments are generally for a period of


year

or less.

As of

December 31, 2019

, future minimum rentals from noncancelable commercial operating leases (excluding both tenant reimbursements of operating expenses and percentage rent based on tenants' sales) are as follows:

NOTE 11—

COMPONENTS OF RENTAL EXPENSE

The principal components of rental expenses are as follows:

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

A summary of share-based compensation expense included in net income is as follows:

We have grants outstanding under our shareholder approved 2010 Performance Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2010 Plan”), which authorized the grant of share options, common shares and other share-based awards for up to

2,450,000

common shares of beneficial interest.

Option awards under the plan are required to have an exercise price at least equal to the closing trading price of our common shares on the date of grant. Options and restricted share awards under the plan generally vest over

three

to

seven

years and option awards typically have a

ten

-year contractual term. We pay dividends on unvested shares. Certain options and share awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control. Additionally, the vesting on certain option and share awards can accelerate in part or in full upon retirement based on the age of the retiree or upon termination without cause.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. Expected volatilities, term, dividend yields, employee exercises and estimated forfeitures are primarily based on historical data. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of each share award is determined based on the closing trading price of our common shares on the grant date.

No

options were granted in

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements (i.e. options and unvested shares) granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over the next

4.9

years

with a weighted-average period of

2.4

years

.

Subsequent to

December 31, 2019

, common shares were awarded under various compensation plans as follows:

NOTE 13—

SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLANS

We have a savings and retirement plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code. Generally, employees can elect, at their discretion, to contribute a portion of their compensation up to a maximum of

$

19,000

for


,

$

18,500

for


, and

18,000

for


. Under the plan, we contribute


%

of each employee’s elective deferrals up to


%

of eligible earnings. In addition, we may make discretionary contributions within the limits of deductibility set forth by the Code. Our full-time employees are immediately eligible to become plan participants. Employees are eligible to receive matching contributions immediately on their participation; however, these matching payments will not vest until their third anniversary of employment. Our expense for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


was approximately

$

764,000

,

$

688,000

and

$

632,000

, respectively.

A non-qualified deferred compensation plan for our officers and certain other employees was established in 1994 that allows the participants to defer a portion of their income. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, we are liable to participants for approximately

$

14.7

million

and

$

12.0

million

, respectively, under this plan. Although this is an unfunded plan, we have purchased certain investments to match this obligation. Our obligation under this plan and the related investments are both included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 14—

EARNINGS PER SHARE

We have calculated earnings per share (“EPS”) under the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation methodology whereby EPS for each class of common stock and participating securities is calculated according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For


,


, and


we had

0.2

million

weighted average unvested shares outstanding, which are considered participating securities. Therefore, we have allocated our earnings for basic and diluted EPS between common shares and unvested shares; the portion of earnings allocated to the unvested shares is reflected as “earnings allocated to unvested shares” in the reconciliation below.

In the dilutive EPS calculation, dilutive stock options were calculated using the treasury stock method consistent with prior periods. There were


anti-dilutive stock options in


,


, and


, respectively. The conversions of downREIT operating partnership units and

5.417

%

Series 1 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares are anti-dilutive for all periods presented and accordingly, have been excluded from the weighted average common shares used to compute diluted EPS.
