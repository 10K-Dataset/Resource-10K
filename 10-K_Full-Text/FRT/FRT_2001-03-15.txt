  Item 1.  Business
  -------  --------

     Federal Realty Investment Trust (the "Trust") is engaged in the ownership,
management, development and redevelopment of prime retail and mixed-use
properties. Founded in 1962, the Trust is a self-administered equity real estate
investment trust. The Trust, which had been founded as a District of Columbia
business trust, re-organized as a Maryland real estate investment trust in May,
1999 by amending and restating its declaration of trust and bylaws. The Trust
consolidates the financial statements of various



entities which it controls. At December 31, 2000 the Trust owned 123 retail or
mixed-use properties and one apartment complex.

     The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
estate investment trust (REIT) for federal income tax purposes. A REIT which
distributes at least 95% of its real estate investment trust taxable income to
its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be
taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.
Beginning in 2001, the distribution requirement for a REIT was lowered from 95%
to 90% of its taxable income.

     An important part of the Trust's strategy has been to acquire older, well-
located properties in prime, densely populated and affluent areas and to enhance
their operating performance through a program of renovation, expansion,
reconfiguration and retenanting. The Trust's traditional focus has been on
community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by supermarkets,
drug stores or high volume, value oriented retailers that provide consumer
necessities. Late in 1994, recognizing a trend of consumer shopping preferences
and retailer expansion to main streets, the Trust expanded its investment
strategy to include shopping centers and retail and mixed-use buildings in prime
established main street shopping areas. In addition, since 1997 the Trust has
obtained control of various land parcels for the purpose of developing urban
mixed-use projects that center around the retail component. The Trust believes
that these mixed-use developments are an important source of future growth.

     The Trust's diversification from being solely a company focused on
acquiring and renovating grocery anchored shopping centers to also being a
developer of mixed-use urban properties involves substantial risks, many of
which are not entirely within the Trust's control. These factors include among
others, the ability to obtain financing, interest rates, the ability to
construct at reasonable prices, the demand for retail, residential and office
space in the Trust's markets, zoning laws, government regulations and the
overall economy. The Trust believes that the geographically desirable locations
of these mixed-use urban properties will make these successful projects and
positive contributors to the underlying net asset value of the Trust.

     The Trust continually evaluates its properties for renovation, retenanting
and expansion opportunities. Similarly, the Trust regularly reviews its
portfolio and from time to time considers selling properties that no longer fit
the Trust's investment criteria and therefore should be monetized or exchanged
into other real estate assets. Proceeds from the sale of such properties may be
used either to acquire other properties, fund the Trust's current development
pipeline or, in 2000 and 1999, to repurchase the Trust's common shares.



     The Trust's portfolio of properties has grown from 71 as of January 1, 1996
to 124 at December 31, 2000. During this five year period the Trust acquired 59
retail properties for approximately $554 million. During this same period six
shopping centers were sold. Also during this period the Trust spent over $424
million to develop, renovate, expand, improve and retenant its properties.

     At December 31, 2000 the Trust has invested $162 million in development in
progress of three projects. During 2001 and 2002, the Trust estimates that it
will spend $258 million and $161 million, respectively, to complete these three
projects, which are located in Bethesda, Maryland, Arlington, Virginia and San
Jose, California. Additional projects, which are in various stages of
predevelopment, may also begin construction in 2001 and 2002.

     Although the Trust usually purchases a 100% fee interest in its
acquisitions, on occasion, it has entered into leases as a means of acquiring
control of properties. In addition, the Trust has purchased certain properties
in partnership with others. Certain of the partnerships, known as "downreit
partnerships", are a means of allowing property owners to make a tax deferred
contribution of their property in exchange for partnership units, which receive
the same distributions as Trust common shares and may be convertible into common
shares of the Trust. The majority of acquisitions are funded with cash, but, on
occasion, debt financing is used. Since a significant portion of cash provided
by operating activities is distributed to common and preferred shareholders,
capital outlays for acquisitions, developments and redevelopments typically
require debt or equity funding.

     The Trust's 124 properties are located in fifteen states and the District
of Columbia. Twenty-six of the properties are located in the Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area; twenty-four are in California; fourteen are in Connecticut;
eleven are in Texas; ten are in Pennsylvania, primarily in the Philadelphia
area; ten are in New Jersey; eight are in New York; seven are in Illinois; four
are in Massachusetts; three are in central Virginia; two are in Florida; two are
in Arizona; and there is one in each of the following states: Michigan, North
Carolina and Oregon. No single property accounts for over 10% of the Trust's
revenues.

     The Trust has traditionally operated its business as a single business
segment. During the fourth quarter of 1998, however, the Trust completed a
comprehensive restructuring program which, among other things, changed the
Trust's operating structure from a functional hierarchy to an asset management
model, where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets. As a
result the Trust has divided its portfolio of properties into three operating
regions: the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West. Each region is operated under the
direction of a regional chief operating officer, with dedicated leasing,
property management and financial



staff and operates largely autonomously with respect to day to day operating
decisions. (See "Segment Results" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a further
discussion of the segments and their results.)

     The Trust has approximately 2,100 tenants, ranging from sole proprietors to
major national retailers; no one tenant or corporate group of tenants accounts
for more than 2.1% of revenue. The Trust's leases with these tenants are
classified as operating leases and typically are structured to include minimum
rents, percentage rents based on tenants' gross sales volumes and reimbursement
of certain operating expenses and real estate taxes.

     The Trust continues to seek older, well-located shopping centers and street
retail projects to acquire, renovate, retenant and remerchandise, thereby
enhancing their revenue potential. The Trust also continues to identify and
secure additional sites for new development of urban mixed-use properties.
During each of the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, retail or
mixed-use properties have contributed 96% of the Trust's total revenue.

     The success of the Trust is subject to various risks, including risks
associated with changing economic conditions that affect the real estate
industry as a whole. Such risks include the following:

   . competition from other retail properties and developers;
   . excessive building of comparable properties or increased unemployment in
     the areas in which its properties are located which may adversely affect
     occupancy levels or rental rates;
   . increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors, which
     increases may not necessarily be offset by increased rents;
   . inability or unwillingness of tenants to pay rent increases;
   . changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences that affect
     its tenants or that result in the merger, closing or relocation of its
     tenants;
   . limitation by local rental markets of the extent to which rents may be
     increased to meet increased expenses without decreasing occupancy rates;
   . future enactment of laws regulating public places, including present and
     possible future laws relating to access by disabled persons;
   . risks relating to leverage, including the ability to finance its
     development pipeline and to refinance its indebtedness, and the risk of
     higher interest rates;
   . unsuccessful development activities which could reduce cash flow;
   . the risk of uninsured losses; and
   . the risk of not meeting the requirements under the REIT provisions of the
     Internal Revenue Code.



     Investments in real property create a potential for environmental liability
on the part of the current and previous owners of, or any mortgage lender on,
such real property. If hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from
any property, the owner or operator of the property may be held liable for costs
and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances. The Trust has
environmental insurance on most of its properties. Subject to certain exclusions
and deductibles, the insurance provides coverage for unidentified, pre-existing
conditions and for future contamination caused by tenants and third parties. The
Trust's current policy is to require an environmental study on each property it
seeks to acquire. On recent acquisitions, any substances identified prior to
closing which are required, by applicable laws, to be remediated have been or
are in the process of investigation and remediation. Costs related to the
abatement of asbestos which increase the value of Trust properties are
capitalized. Other costs are expensed. In 2000 and 1999 approximately $1,453,000
and $952,000, respectively, was spent on environmental matters, of which
$464,000 and $654,000, respectively, was capitalized abatement costs. The Trust
has budgeted approximately $800,000 in 2001 for environmental matters, a
majority of which is projected for asbestos abatement.

Current Developments
- --------------------

     In 2000 improvements to properties totaled $153.1 million, including $82.1
million on development projects in Bethesda, Maryland; San Jose, California; and
Arlington, Virginia. Construction of Woodmont East in Bethesda, Maryland neared
completion with the first tenant opening in December 2000 and subsequent
openings scheduled in 2001. In November 2000 construction began on the $475
million Phase 1 of Santana Row, a multi-phased mixed-use project to be built on
42 acres in San Jose, California. Santana Row Phase 1 is expected to begin
generating revenues in mid-2002 and be stabilized during 2003. Construction also
began on the $74 million Pentagon Row project in Arlington, Virginia with a
phased-in completion expected throughout 2001.

     Real estate acquisitions totaling $26.8 million were made in 2000. Such
acquisitions consisted of two parcels of land held for future development in
Hillsboro, Oregon and Bethesda, Maryland along with three small retail
properties. Additionally, in connection with the purchase of the limited
partnership interest in Loehmann's Plaza the Trust expended $3.0 million.

     The Trust invested $5.7 million in mortgage notes receivable with an
average weighted interest rate of 10.0%, with $6.2 million of notes being
repaid. Peninsula Shopping Center in Palos Verdes, California was sold in June
2000 for $48.6 million, resulting in a gain of $3.7 million.

     In December 1999, the Trustees authorized a share



   repurchase program for calendar year 2000 of up to an aggregate of 4 million
   of the Trust's common shares. A total of 1,325,900 shares were repurchased,
   at a cost of $25.2 million. The Trust does not expect to repurchase shares in
   2001.

       The Trust utilized its syndicated credit facility to fund these
   acquisitions, capital expenditures and share repurchases. Repayments on the
   syndicated credit facility were made from the proceeds of the sale of
   Peninsula Shopping Center as well as the placement, on October 23, 2000, of a
   $152 million mortgage loan, which is secured by five shopping centers.

       In June 2000, the Trust modified certain covenants and extended its
   syndicated credit facility and its $125 million term loan for an additional
   year to December 19, 2003. Fees paid for this extension totaled $1.0 million.

       At December 31, 2000 the Trust had 230 full-time employees.

         The Trust intends to pay regular quarterly distributions to its common
stockholders. Future distributions will depend upon cash generated by operating
activities, the Trust's financial condition, capital requirements, annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
and such other factors as the Board of Trustees deems relevant.




Item 6.  Selected Financial Data.
         -----------------------

In thousands, except per share data








(1) Determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows.


(2) As of January 1, 2000, Funds from operations is defined by the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) as income available for
common shareholders before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets
and before extraordinary items less gains on sale of real estate. Prior to
January 1, 2000 funds from operation also excluded significant nonrecurring
events. Funds from operations differs from net cash provided by operating
activities primarily because funds from operations does not include changes in
operating assets and liabilities. Funds from operations is a supplemental
measure of performance used in the real estate industry that does not replace
net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating
activities as a measure of liquidity. Rather, funds from operations has been
adopted by real estate investment trusts to provide a consistent measure of
operating performance in the industry. Nevertheless, funds from operations, as
presented by the Trust, may not be comparable to funds from operations as
presented by other real estate investment trusts.



The calculation of funds from operations for the periods presented is reflected
in the following table:





Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of Operations
- -------------

     The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto of Federal Realty Investment Trust (the
"Trust").

     The Trust is engaged in the ownership, management, development and
redevelopment of prime retail and mixed-use properties. The Trust, which has
traditionally acquired and redeveloped strip retail shopping centers, has
expanded its investments to the development of urban mixed-used properties.
Management continually evaluates the future prospects of its real estate
portfolio, not only to identify expansion and renovation opportunities, but also
to identify properties that no longer fit the Trust's investment criteria and
therefore, should be monetized or exchanged into other real estate assets. At
December 31, 2000 the Trust owned 123 retail properties and one apartment
complex.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

     The Trust meets its liquidity requirements through net cash provided by
operating activities, along with traditional debt and equity funding
alternatives available to it. A significant portion of cash provided by
operating activities is distributed to common and preferred shareholders in the
form of dividends. Accordingly, capital outlays for property acquisitions, major
renovation and development projects and balloon debt repayments require debt or
equity funding. Proceeds from the sale of selected assets may also provide an
additional source of capital in 2001 and 2002.

     Net cash provided by operating activities was $106.1 million in 2000,
$102.2 million in 1999, and $90.4 million in 1998, of which $77.5 million, $76.6
million, and $74.3 million, respectively, was distributed to shareholders.
Contributions from newly acquired properties and from retenanted and redeveloped
properties, as more fully described below, were the primary sources of these
increases.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $121.7 million in 2000, $99.3
million in 1999, and $187.6 million in 1998. The Trust acquired properties
totaling $26.8 million in 2000, $26.4 million in 1999, and $120.4 million in
1998 requiring cash outlays of $23.6 million, $25.3 million, and $92.9 million,
respectively. During these same three years the Trust expended an additional
$145.8 million, $90.8 million, and $73.0 million in capital improvements to its
properties, of which $82.1 million in 2000, $38.7 million in 1999 and $25.0
million in 1998 related to new development. The Trust received mortgage note
repayments, net of funds invested, of $494,000 in 2000. The Trust invested, net
of loan repayments, $2.3 million, and $21.4 million in 1999 and 1998,
respectively, in mortgage notes receivable. The average weighted stated interest
rate on these loans was 10.0% for the years 1998 through 2000. Certain of these
mortgages also participate in the gross revenues and appreciation and are
convertible into ownership interests in the properties by which they are
secured. Cash of $47.2 million in 2000



and $19.2 million in 1999 was received from the sale of properties.

     During 2000 the Trust expended cash of $23.6 million to acquire real estate
and an additional $145.8 million to improve, redevelop and develop its existing
real estate. The Trust purchased the 75,000 square foot Greenlawn Plaza in
Greenlawn, New York for $6.2 million. Control of a parcel of land for future
development in Hillsboro, Oregon was acquired for $11.7 million; an additional
$1.6 million will be owed if certain cash flow criteria are met during the first
ten years of operations. Other acquisitions include a parcel of land in
Bethesda, Maryland for $461,000; an additional property for the Trust's Houston
Street project in San Antonio, Texas for cash of $1.2 million and the assumption
of a $345,000 mortgage; a retail building in Santa Monica, California in
satisfaction of a $5.2 million mortgage note receivable and cash of $1.7
million; and the $2.3 million redemption of 100,000 partnership units which had
been issued in connection with the purchase of the Courthouse Square and
Magruders Shopping Centers.

     Of the $145.8 million spent in 2000 on the Trust's existing real estate
portfolio, approximately $82.1 million was invested in development projects in
Bethesda, Maryland; San Jose, California; and in Arlington, Virginia. The
remaining $63.7 million of capital expenditures relates to improvements to
common areas, tenant work and various redevelopments, including the renovation
of Greenlawn Plaza, the office expansion and retenanting of Willow Lawn Shopping
Center, the renovation of Brunswick Shopping Center, and the redevelopment of
retail buildings in Forest Hills, New York, San Antonio, Texas and southern
California.

     The Trust, which held the 1% general partnership interest, obtained an
additional 98% general partnership interest in the future operations of
Loehmann's Plaza. The minority partner received 190,000 partnership units valued
at $3.6 million and the satisfaction of amounts due the Trust from the
partnership.

     Peninsula Shopping Center in Palos Verdes, California was sold in June 2000
for $48.6 million, resulting in a gain of $3.7 million.

     Net cash provided by financing activities, before dividend payments, was
$92.7 million in 2000, $68.3 million in 1999, and $171.7 million in 1998. The
Trust utilized the proceeds from the sale of Peninsula Shopping Center and its
syndicated credit facility to fund acquisitions, most capital expenditures,
share repurchases and balloon debt repayments.

     On February 29, 2000, the Trust obtained a construction loan for up to
$24.5 million in connection with the Trust's Woodmont East development in
Bethesda, Maryland. The loan, which has a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus
1.2% to 1.5%, depending on occupancy levels, matures August 29, 2002 with two
one-year extension options. At December 31, 2000, the outstanding balance on the
loan was $16.2 million. The property secures the construction loan facility.

     In connection with the land for future development in Hillsboro, Oregon,
the Trust issued a $3.4 million note which is due June 30, 2001. The loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus 1.25%. The property secures the loan facility. The Trust
assumed a



mortgage with the purchase of the new East Houston Street property in San
Antonio, Texas. The mortgage, which matures in October 2008, bears interest at
7.5% and provides for monthly principal and interest payments.

     On October 23, 2000, the Trust obtained a $152 million mortgage loan which
is secured by five shopping centers. The mortgage, which bears interest at
7.95%, matures November 1, 2015 and required an up-front fee of $988,000. The
loan provides for interest only payments for the initial three years, then
monthly principal and interest payments based on a twenty-seven year
amortization schedule until the maturity date. The proceeds from the mortgage
loan were used to pay down the Trust's syndicated credit facility.

     The Trust has a $300 million syndicated credit facility with seven banks,
originally due December 2002. This facility requires fees and has various
covenants including the maintenance of a minimum shareholders' equity and a
maximum ratio of debt to net worth. At December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, $78.0
million, $34.0 million and $134.1 million, respectively, was borrowed under the
syndicated credit facility. The maximum borrowed during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$218.1 million, $205.0 million and $259.1 million, respectively. The weighted
average interest rate on borrowings during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was 7.1%, 5.9%
and 6.1%, respectively.

     In December 1998, the Trust obtained a four-year loan of $125 million from
five institutional lenders. The loan requires fees and has the same covenants as
the syndicated credit facility. The average weighted interest rate on the term
loan was 7.4% in 2000 and 6.1% in 1999.

     In June 2000, the Trust modified certain covenants and extended its
syndicated credit facility and its $125 million term loan for an additional year
to December 19, 2003. Fees paid for this extension totaled $1.0 million.

     In July 2000, citing the Trust's pursuit of development and the resultant
capital requirements, Standard and Poor's lowered the rating on the Trust's
senior notes from BBB+ to BBB flat with a positive outlook. Under the terms of
the syndicated credit facility, this lowered rating resulted in an increase in
the Trust's borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 65 basis points to LIBOR plus 80
basis points. The interest rate on the term loan increased from LIBOR plus 75
basis points to LIBOR plus 95 basis points.

     On November 30, 1999 the Trust issued $175 million of 8.75% Notes due
December 1, 2009, netting cash proceeds of $172.2 million. The notes pay
interest semi-annually on June 1 and December 1.

     In order to minimize the risk of changes in interest rates, from time to
time in connection with the issuance of certain debt issues the Trust will enter
into interest rate hedge agreements. In anticipation of the mortgage placement
in the third quarter of 2000, the Trust purchased a Treasury Yield Hedge
(notional amount of $140 million) to minimize the risk of increased interest
rates prior to closing the mortgage. The hedge was terminated on June 30, 2000
at a gain of $165,000 which is being recognized as a reduction of



interest expense over the term of the mortgage loan. There were no open hedge
agreements at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

     In December 1999 the Trustees authorized a share repurchase program for
calendar year 2000 of up to an aggregate of 4 million of the Trust's common
shares. A total of 1,325,900 shares were repurchased, at a cost of $25.2
million. The Trust does not expect to repurchase shares in 2001.

     Capital requirements in 2001 will depend upon acquisition opportunities,
new development efforts, the rate of build-out on the Trust's current
development pipeline and the level of improvements and redevelopments on
existing properties. The Trust has budgeted approximately $258 million for 2001
for its three developments in progress and $75 million for new development,
redevelopments, tenant work and improvements to the core portfolio.

     The Trust will need additional capital in order to fund acquisitions,
expansions and developments, particularly Santana Row, and to refinance its
maturing debt. Sources of this funding may be additional debt, both secured and
unsecured, additional equity and joint venture relationships. In addition, the
Trust has identified certain of its properties that may be exchanged or sold as
a source of funding, if the Trust's sales price is met.

     The Trust's long term debt has varying maturity dates and in a number of
instances includes balloon payments or other contractual provisions that could
require significant repayments during a particular period. In 2001, $30.7
million of mortgage debt matures, as well as the $3.4 million note held in
connection with the land held for future development in Hillsboro, Oregon. The
next significant maturities are $25.0 million of Senior Notes, due April 2002
and the Woodmont East construction loan due August, 2002. The construction loan
contains two, one-year options to extend.

Santana Row

     In the next several years, the Trust's single largest capital need is
expected to come from the development of Santana Row, a multi-phase mixed-use
project to be built on 42 acres in San Jose, California in the heart of Silicon
Valley. The project will consist of residential, retail and hotel components,
creating a community with the feel of an urban district. Phase 1 of the project,
for which construction began November 2000, includes Santana Row, the "1,500
foot long main street" framed by nine buildings which will contain approximately
538,000 square feet of retail space, 501 residential units, a 214 room hotel and
the supporting infrastructure. Phase 1 is expected to begin generating revenues
in mid-2002 and be stabilized during 2003. The total cost of Phase 1, which
includes the land and infrastructure for the later phases, is expected to be
$475 million. As of December 31, 2000, the Trust has incurred costs of $97
million including the purchase of the land; the trust estimates that it will
spend approximately $200 million in 2001 and the balance in 2002 to complete the
first phase of the project. The Trust has a signed commitment from three banks
for up to $295 million of construction financing for Phase 1. Closing on the
commitment is subject to the



completion of customary due diligence for loans of this type and funding is
subject to satisfaction of leasing and other contingencies. Phase 1, which
includes the land and infrastructure for future phases, comprises approximately
40% of the residential and 75% of the retail entitlement currently projected for
the entire project.

     The success of Santana Row will depend on many factors which cannot be
assured and are not entirely within the Trust's control. These factors include
among others, continued strong demand for retail and residential space at
current or increasing prices, the ability to construct the later phases at
reasonable prices, the cost of operations, including utilities, the availability
and cost of capital and the general economy, particularly in the Silicon Valley.

     The timing and choice of capital sources will depend on the cost and
availability of that capital, among other things. The Trust believes, based on
past experience, that access to capital needed to execute its business plan will
be available to it.

Contingencies
- -------------

     Pentagon Row is a mixed-use project with the retail component being
developed by the Trust and the residential component being developed by an
unrelated developer. In October 2000 the general contractor on the project was
replaced by the Trust and the residential developer, because of schedule delays
and other events that caused the Trust and the residential developer to conclude
that the original contractor was either unable or unwilling to comply with its
contractual obligations. The Trust and the residential developer filed suit
against the original contractor to recover damages that they anticipate they
will incur as a result of defaults under the contract. The original contractor
filed a counter-claim against the Trust and the residential developer for
damages of $7 million plus interest, attorneys' fees and litigation costs. The
Trust believes that the counterclaim is generally without merit and that the
outcome of the counterclaim will not have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, results of operations or on the project. Work continues
under the direction of the new general contractor and the Trust does not believe
that there will be any material impairment on the project as a result of the
schedule delays.

     In addition, the Trust is involved in various other lawsuits and
environmental matters arising in the normal course of business. Management
believes that such matters will not have a material effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of the Trust.

     Pursuant to the provisions of the Congressional Plaza partnership
agreement, in the event of the exercise of put options by another partner, which
are currently exercisable and have no expiration date, the Trust would be
required to purchase a 37.5% interest at Congressional Plaza at its then fair
market value. Based on management's current estimate of fair market value, the
Trust's estimated cash requirement upon exercise of the put option is
approximately $27 million.



     Under the terms of six other partnership agreements, if certain leasing
and revenue levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships,
the limited partners may require the Trust to purchase their partnership
interests at a formula price based upon net operating income. The purchase price
may be paid in cash or a limited number of common shares of the Trust, at the
election of the limited partners. In certain of the partnerships, if the limited
partners do not redeem their interest, the Trust may choose to purchase the
limited partnership interests upon the same terms.

     The limited partners of two partnerships owning street retail properties in
southern California have exercised their rights under these agreements. The
Trust purchased their interests in March 2001 for approximately $18 million,
approximately $7 million in common shares of the Trust and the balance in cash.

     Under the terms of other partnership agreements, the partners may redeem
their 904,589 operating units for cash or exchange into the same number of
common shares of the Trust, at the option of the Trust. During the third quarter
of 2000 the Trust redeemed 100,000 operating units for cash of $2.3 million.

     As of December 31, 2000 in connection with renovation and development
projects, the Trust has contractual obligations of approximately $46 million.



Results of Operations
- ---------------------

     The Trust's retail leases generally provide for minimum rents with periodic
increases. Most retail tenants pay a majority of on-site operating expenses and
real estate taxes. Many leases also contain a percentage rent clause which calls
for additional rents based on gross tenant sales. These features in the Trust's
leases reduce the Trust's exposure to higher costs caused by inflation and allow
it to participate in improved tenant sales.

Consolidated Results
- --------------------

2000 vs. 1999

     Rental income, which consists of minimum rent, percentage rent and cost
recoveries, increased 6.0 % from $245.8 million in 1999 to $260.7 million in
2000. On a same center basis, rental income increased 7.7%, due primarily to the
favorable impact of redeveloped and retenanted centers, as well as, increases
associated with lease rollovers. Same center basis, in 2000, excludes properties
acquired in 2000 and 1999, Peninsula Shopping Center in Palos Verdes, California
and Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia which were sold on June 30, 2000 and
October 18, 1999, respectively and properties developed in 2000 and 1999,
including Bethesda Row Phase 3 in Bethesda, Maryland, Old Town in Los Gatos,
California and Town & Country Shopping Center in San Jose, California which was
vacated as the Santana Row development began.

     Other property income includes items which, although recurring, tend to
fluctuate from period to period, such as utility reimbursements, telephone
income, merchant association dues, late fees and temporary tenant income. Also
included are less regularly recurring items, such as lease termination fees.
Other property income remained constant in 2000 compared to 1999. On a same
center basis, other property income decreased $473,000 in 2000 compared to 1999,
due mostly to decreases in lease termination fees.

     Rental expenses increased 4.8% from $53.7 million in 1999 to $56.3 million
in 2000. On a same center basis, rental expenses increased 6.0% from $49.6
million in 1999 to $52.6 million in 2000, primarily due to general cost
increases along with increased snow removal and utility costs in 2000. Rental
expense as a percentage of property income, rental income plus other property
income, remained constant in both periods at 21%.

     Real estate taxes increased 6.4% from $25.0 million in 1999 to $26.6
million in 2000. On a same center basis, real estate taxes increased 5.9% due
primarily to increased taxes on recently redeveloped properties.

     Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 6.5% from $50.0 million in
1999 to $53.3 million in 2000 reflecting the impact of recent tenant work and
property improvements.

     In 2000, the Trust incurred interest expense of $79.7 million, of which
$13.3 million was capitalized, as compared to 1999's $68.4 million, of which
$6.9 million was capitalized. The



increase in interest expense reflects the additional debt issued to fund the
Trust's share repurchase and capital improvement programs and increased
borrowing costs. The weighted average interest rate was 8.0% in 2000 compared
with 7.6% in 1999. The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred
dividends was 1.40x in 2000 and 1.52x in 1999. The ratio of earnings to fixed
charges was 1.50x in 2000 and 1.70x in 1999. The ratio of funds from operations
to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends was 2.0x in 2000 and 2.2x in
1999.

     Administrative expenses decreased from $15.1 million in 1999 to $13.3
million in 2000. In 1999 the Trust incurred expenses of approximately $2.8
million related to a terminated merger transaction. The decrease in these costs
was offset by increased personnel costs and several key new hires. The tight
labor market in the Trust's operating regions resulted in higher compensation
costs both to existing and new employees.

     Investors share of operations represents the minority interest in the
income of certain properties. The majority of the $2.6 million increase from
$3.9 million in 1999 to $6.5 million in 2000 is due to the allocation of
operating losses to minority owners in 1999 and 1998 in accordance with the
respective partnership agreements. The remainder of the increase represents the
minority partners share of increased earnings in certain shopping center and
street retail assets.

     On June 30, 2000, the Trust sold the 296,000 square foot Peninsula Shopping
Center located in Palos Verdes, California for $48.6 million resulting in a gain
of $3.7 million. During the second quarter of 1999, the Trust recorded a $7.1
million charge, representing the estimated loss on a potential sale of certain
assets, principally Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia, thereby valuing the
assets at their estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. On October
18, 1999, the Trust sold Northeast Plaza for $19.6 million, realizing a loss of
$6.3 million.

     As a result of the foregoing items, net income before gain (loss) on the
sale of real estate increased from $55.5 million in 1999 to $56.8 million in
2000, while net income increased from $48.4 million in 1999 to $60.5 million in
2000 and net income available for common shareholders increased from $40.5
million to $52.6 million.

     Growth in net income and funds from operations in 2001 is expected to be
slower than in 2000 based on the following factors; there will be a lower
contribution from redevelopment projects as much of the Trust's southern
California redevelopments were completed in 2000, higher administrative expenses
necessitated by tight labor markets and the addition of key positions and a
temporary reduction in earnings caused by the demolition of the old Town &
Country Shopping Center in 2000 to make way for the new Santana Row development.
The growth in 2001 will continue to be primarily dependent on contributions from
the core portfolio. Growth of net income from the core portfolio is, in part,
dependent on the financial health of the Trust's tenants and on controlling
expenses, some of which are beyond the control of the Trust, such as snow
removal and real estate tax assessments. The



Trust expects that demand for its retail space should remain at its current
levels. A weakening of the retail environment could, however, adversely impact
the Trust by increasing vacancies and decreasing rents. In past weak retail and
real estate environments, the Trust has been able to replace weak and bankrupt
tenants with stronger tenants; management believes that due to the quality of
the Trust's properties there will continue to be demand for its space.

     Growth in net income is also dependent on the amount of leverage and
interest rates. The Trust's leverage is increasing as it finances its
development pipeline. In addition, the Trust will continue to have exposure to
changes in market interest rates. If interest rates increase, net income and
funds from operations, as well as the ultimate cost of the Trust's development
projects, will be negatively impacted.

1999 vs. 1998

     Rental income, which consists of minimum rent, percentage rent and cost
recoveries, increased 11% from $222.2 million in 1998 to $245.8 million in 1999.
If properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998 are excluded, rental income
increased 6%, with the recently renovated and retenanted centers contributing
heavily to the growth, as well as, increases associated with lease rollovers.

     Other property income includes items, such as utility reimbursements,
telephone income, merchant association dues, late fees, temporary income and
lease termination fees. Other income increased 9% from $10.3 million in 1998 to
$11.2 million in 1999. An increase of $650,000 in temporary tenant income, an
area identified by the Trust as one with additional growth opportunity, and an
increase of $550,000 in lease termination fees surpassed decreases in telephone
income and decreases in marketing dues, as the Trust discontinued marketing
funds at certain shopping centers in 1999.

     Rental expenses increased 8% from $49.5 million in 1998 to $53.7 million in
1999. If properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998 are excluded, rental
expenses increased 5%. A $1.2 million increase in the write off of tenant work
and lease costs associated with bankrupt or terminated leases coupled with a
$975,000 increase in snow removal costs offset the decrease in marketing
expenses, consistent with the decrease in marketing dues.

     Real estate taxes increased 7% from $23.3 million in 1998 to $25.0 million
in 1999. If properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998 are excluded, real
estate taxes increased 4%, primarily due to increased taxes on recently
redeveloped properties.

     Depreciation and amortization expense increased 9% from $46.0 million in
1998 to $50.0 million in 1999. If properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998
are excluded, depreciation and amortization expense increased 7% due to the
impact of recent tenant work and redevelopments.

     Interest income increased 29% from $5.9 million in 1998 to $7.6 million in
1999 due primarily to the issuance of approximately $24 million of mortgage
notes receivable in 1999 and 1998.



     In 1999 the Trust incurred interest expense of $68.4 million, of which $6.9
million was capitalized, as compared to 1998's $60.2 million, of which $5.1
million was capitalized. The increase in interest expense reflects the
additional debt issued to help fund the Trust's 1999 real estate acquisitions
and capital improvements of approximately $116 million. The weighted average
interest rate was 7.6% in 1999 compared with 8% in 1998. The ratio of earnings
to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends was 1.52x in 1999 and 1.46x in
1998. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.70x in 1999 and 1.65x in
1998. The ratio of funds from operations to combined fixed charges and preferred
dividends was 2.2x in 1999 and 1998.


     Administrative expenses decreased from $16.5 million in 1998 to $15.1
million in 1999. Both years contained unusual expenses. During the third quarter
of 1998, the Trust recorded a $4.7 million charge related to a comprehensive
restructuring program. During the third quarter of 1999, the Trust, in exploring
strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, considered spinning off
certain of its assets and merging the remaining assets with another publicly
traded shopping center company. The Trust incurred expenses of approximately
$2.8 million in connection with this proposed merger and spin-off which were not
consummated. In addition, costs related to abandoned acquisition and development
projects increased approximately $1.5 million in 1999 over 1998.

     Investors' share of operations represents the minority interest in the
income of certain properties. One third of the increase from $3.1 million in
1998 to $3.9 million in 1999 is due to the income attributable to the operating
partnership units issued upon the acquisition of Kings Court and Leesburg Plaza
in the second half of 1998. The majority of the remaining increase represents
the minority partners' share of the increased earnings in the southern
California street retail assets, many of which have been redeveloped during 1998
and 1999.

     As a result of the foregoing items, net income before loss on the sale of
real estate increased from $45.0 million in 1998 to $55.5 million in 1999,
reflecting both the contribution to net income from the Trust's acquisitions and
the contribution from the core portfolio, primarily the recently redeveloped and
retenanted properties.

     During the second quarter of 1999, the Trust recorded a $7.1 million
charge, representing the estimated loss on the potential sale of certain assets,
principally Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia. On October 18, 1999 the Trust
sold Northeast Plaza for $19.6 million, realizing a loss of $6.3 million.
Consequently, net income increased from $45.0 million in 1998 to $48.4 million
in 1999 with net income available for common shareholders increasing from $37.0
million in 1998 to $40.5 million in 1999.



Segment Results
- ---------------

     The Trust has traditionally operated its business as a single business
segment. During the fourth quarter of 1998, however, the Trust completed a
comprehensive restructuring program which, among other things, changed the
Trust's operating structure from a functional hierarchy to an asset management
model, where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets. As a
result the Trust has divided its portfolio of properties into three geographic
operating regions: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West. Each region is operated
under the direction of a chief operating officer, with dedicated leasing,
property management and financial staff and operates largely autonomously with
respect to day to day operating decisions. Incentive compensation, throughout
the regional teams, is tied to the net operating income of the respective
portfolios.

Historical operating results for the three regions are as follows (in
thousands):



The Northeast

     The Northeast region is comprised of 54 assets, extending from suburban
Philadelphia north to New York and its suburbs into New England and west to
Illinois and Michigan. A significant portion of this portfolio has been held by
the Trust for many years although acquisitions, redevelopment and retenanting
remain major components to the current and future performance of the region.
Several redevelopment projects were completed in 2000, which enhanced revenues
and net operating income in 2000.

     When comparing 2000 with 1999, rental income increased 10% from $102.5
million in 1999 to $113.1 million in 2000. Excluding Greenlawn Plaza in
Greenlawn, New York which was acquired on January 5, 2000, on a same center
basis, rental income also increased 10%, primarily due to increases at the
recently redeveloped and



retenanted shopping centers such as, Bala Cynwyd, Lawrence Park, Gratiot,
Langhorne Square, and Wynnewood.

     Net operating income increased 7% from $74.3 million in 1999 to $79.7
million in 2000. Excluding Greenlawn Plaza in Greenlawn, New York which was
acquired on January 5, 2000, on a same center basis, net operating income also
increased 7%, primarily due to increases at the recently redeveloped and
retenanted Bala Cynwyd, Lawrence Park, Gratiot, Langhorne Square, and Wynnewood
shopping centers.

     When comparing 1999 with 1998, rental income increased 9% from $93.6
million in 1998 to $102.5 million in 1999. Excluding properties acquired during
the two periods, rental income increased 7%, driven by increases at the recently
redeveloped and retenanted Brick, Feasterville, Gratiot, Huntington and
Wynnewood shopping centers.

     Net operating income increased 12% from $66.4 million in 1998 to $74.3
million in 1999. Excluding properties acquired in 1998 and 1999, net operating
income increased 9%, primarily due to increases at the recently redeveloped and
retenanted Brick, Feasterville, Gratiot, Huntington and Wynnewood shopping
centers.

The Mid-Atlantic

     The Mid-Atlantic region is comprised of 32 assets, including Pentagon Row
which is currently under development, extending from Baltimore south to
metropolitan Washington D.C. and further south through Virginia and North
Carolina into Florida. As with the Northeast region, a significant portion of
this portfolio has been held by the Trust for many years although acquisitions,
redevelopment and retenanting remain major components to its current and future
performance. Two of the Trust's major new development projects, Pentagon Row and
additional phases of Bethesda Row, will be managed by this regional operating
team upon their completion.

     When comparing 2000 with 1999, rental income increased 3% from $111.6
million in 1999 to $114.4 million in 2000. On a same center basis, excluding
Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia which was sold in 1999 and the recently
developed Phase 3 of the Bethesda Row project in Bethesda, Maryland, rental
income increased 4%, due in part to new anchor leases at several centers. Net
operating income increased 4% from $81.4 million in 1999 to $84.3 million in
2000. On a same center basis as above, net operating income increased 5%, due
primarily to new anchor leases and lease termination fees.

     When comparing 1999 with 1998, rental income increased 8% from $103.7
million in 1998 to $111.6 million in 1999. Excluding properties acquired and
sold in 1999 and 1998, rental income increased 5%.

     Net operating income increased 7% from $76.1 million in 1998 to $81.4
million in 1999. Excluding properties acquired and sold in 1999 and 1998, net
operating income increased 3%.



The West

     The West region is comprised of 38 assets, including Santana Row which is
currently under development, extending from Texas to the West Coast. Unlike the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, this portfolio is relatively new to the
Trust and is part of a deliberate expansion west over the past several years.
This region is the fastest growing at the Trust and includes the Trust's largest
new development project, Santana Row in San Jose, California. Several
redevelopment projects were completed in 2000 and several more are currently
underway, particularly in southern California and San Antonio, Texas, which are
expected to add to revenues and net operating income in 2001 and future years.

     When comparing 2000 with 1999 on a same center basis, which excludes newly
developed properties, Santana Row, which is currently under development, and
properties sold and acquired since January 1, 1999, rental income increased 20%
from $19.7 million in 1999 to $23.5 million in 2000, due primarily to recently
redeveloped and retenanted properties in the Los Angeles and San Francisco,
California areas. On an overall basis, which includes the impact of the sale of
Peninsula Shopping Center on June 30, 2000 and the temporary reduction in
earnings caused by the demolition of the old Town & Country Shopping Center to
make way for the new Santana Row development, rental income increased 5% from
$31.8 million in 1999 to $33.2 million in 2000.

     On the same center basis as defined above, net operating income increased
25% from $14.2 million in 1999 to $17.8 million in 2000, due to increases from
the recently redeveloped and retenanted properties in the Los Angeles and San
Francisco, California areas. Overall net operating income increased 10% from
$22.7 million in 1999 to $24.8 million in 2000, again reflecting the sale of
Peninsula Shopping Center and the temporary reduction in earnings caused by the
Santana Row development.

     When comparing 1999 with 1998, rental income increased 28% from $24.9
million in 1998 to $31.8 million in 1999. Excluding properties acquired in 1999
and 1998, rental income increased 11%, driven by the redevelopment of Old Town
in Los Gatos, California and several street retail buildings in southern
California.

     Net operating income increased 31% from $17.3 million in 1998 to $22.7
million in 1999. Excluding properties acquired in 1999 and 1998, net operating
income increased 14%, driven by the redevelopment of Old Town in Los Gatos,
California and several street retail buildings in southern California.



Funds from Operations
- ---------------------

     The Trust has historically reported its funds from operations in addition
to its net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Funds from
operations is a supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating
performance. As of January 1, 2000, the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines funds from operations as follows: income
available for common shareholders before depreciation and amortization of real
estate assets and before extraordinary items less gains on sale of real estate.
Prior to January 1, 2000, funds from operations also excluded significant
nonrecurring events. Funds from operations does not replace net income as a
measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure
of liquidity. Rather, funds from operations has been adopted by real estate
investment trusts to provide a consistent measure of operating performance in
the industry. Nevertheless, funds from operations, as presented by the Trust,
may not be comparable to funds from operations as presented by other real estate
investment trusts.

     The reconciliation of net income to funds from operations is as follows (in
thousands):





Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Trust's primary financial market risk is the fluctuation in interest
rates. At December 31, 2000, the Trust had $232.0 million of variable rate debt.
Based upon this balance of variable debt, if interest rates increased 1%, the
Trust's earnings and cash flows would decrease by $2.3 million. If interest
rates decreased 1%, the Trust's earnings and cash flows would increase by $2.3
million. The Trust believes that the change in the fair value of its financial
instruments resulting from a forseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be
immaterial to its total assets and total liabilities.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
- ---------------------------------------------------

     Included in Item 14.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Financial Disclosure.
- --------------------

 On May 5, 1999, the Trust appointed the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen LLP
as independent public accountants to replace Grant Thornton LLP, which was
dismissed effective the same date. The Trust's Board of Trustees approved the
decision to change independent public accountants upon the recommendation of the
Trust's Audit Committee. During the Trust's fiscal year ended December 31, 1998
and the interim period through March 31, 1999 there were no disagreements with
Grant Thornton LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. The reports
issued by Grant Thornton LLP on the financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 1998 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and
were not qualified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

     During the Trust's fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 and the interim
period through March 31, 1999, the Trust had not consulted with Arthur Andersen
LLP regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified
transaction, the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Trust's
financial statements, or any matter that was either the subject of a
disagreement or a reportable event.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Trustees and Shareholders of
Federal Realty Investment Trust:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Federal Realty
Investment Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, common shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in
the two year period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Federal Realty
Investment Trust and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
two year period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The financial statement
schedules included on pages F-28 through F-33 of the Form 10-K are presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
are not a required part of the basic consolidated financial statements. These
schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audit of
the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly
stated in all material respects in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.

Federal Realty Investment Trust
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998


SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Federal Realty Investment Trust (the "Trust") is a full-service real estate
company, which owns and operates community and neighborhood shopping centers and
which owns and develops main street retail properties, retail buildings and
mixed-use properties located in densely developed urban and suburban areas.

     The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. A trust which
distributes at least 95% of its real estate investment trust taxable income to
its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be
taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

     The consolidated financial statements of the Trust include the accounts of
the Trust, its wholly owned corporate subsidiaries, several corporations where
the Trust has a majority ownership, numerous partnerships and a joint venture,
all of which it controls. The equity interests of other investors are reflected
as investors' interest in consolidated assets. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition. Leases with tenants are classified as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
related leases net of valuation adjustments based on management's assessment of
credit, collection and other business risk. Percentage rents, which represent
additional rents based on gross tenant sales, are recognized at the end of the
lease year or other period in which tenant sales' volumes have been reached and
the percentage rents are due. Real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are
recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the expenditures
occurred.

Real Estate. Land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at
cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful
lives range from three to 25 years on apartment buildings and improvements, and
from three to 35 years on retail properties and improvements. Maintenance and
repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant work and other major
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease and
their estimated useful life, respectively. The gain or loss resulting from the
sale of properties is included in net income at the time of sale. Upon
termination of a lease, undepreciated tenant improvement costs are charged to
operations if the assets are replaced and the asset and the corresponding
accumulated depreciation are retired.

                                       F7


The Trust evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of". In cases where particular assets are being held for sale, impairment is
based on whether the fair value (estimated sales price less costs of disposal)
of each individual property to be sold is less than the net book value.
Otherwise, impairment is based on whether it is probable that undiscounted
future cash flows from each property will be less than its net book value. If a
property is impaired, its basis is adjusted to its fair market value.

     The Trust, when applicable as lessee, classifies its leases of land and
buildings as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases".

     Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development,
redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and their
related direct costs are capitalized. The capitalized costs associated with
developments, redevelopments and leasing are depreciated or amortized over the
life of the improvement and lease, respectively. Unamortized leasing costs are
charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of
their lease. Through March 1998, internal costs of preacquisition activities
incurred in connection with the acquisition of an operating property were
capitalized. On March 19, 1998 the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus opinion on issue #97-
11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real Estate Property
Acquisitions" which requires that the internal costs of preacquisition
activities incurred in connection with the acquisition of an operating property
be expensed as incurred. Consequently, the Trust has been expensing these costs
since March 1998.

     Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as
part of the development and redevelopment.

Debt Issue Costs. Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are
capitalized and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the related
issue using the effective interest method. Upon conversion or in the event of
redemption, applicable unamortized costs are charged to shareholders' equity or
to operations, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Trust defines cash as cash on hand, demand
deposits with financial institutions and short term liquid investments with an
initial maturity under three months. Cash balances in individual banks may
exceed insurable amounts from time to time.

Risk Management. The Trust has occasionally entered into derivative contracts
prior to a scheduled financing or refinancing in order to minimize the risk of
changes in interest rates. The derivative contracts are designated as hedges
when acquired. The gain or loss on these transactions is recognized as a
component of interest expense over the life of the financing.

                                       F8


The Trust does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. There were no open derivative contracts at December 31,
2000 or 1999. In June 1998, SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities" was issued. This statement established accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. It requires
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. If
certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a
hedge of the exposure to certain risks. SFAS No. 137 "Deferral of Effective Date
of SFAS No. 133" was issued and delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 133. SFAS
No. 133 is effective January 1, 2001 for the Trust. As previously stated, the
Trust has no derivatives as of December 31, 2000 and as a result, there is no
related transition adjustment upon transition.

Acquisition, Development and Construction Loan Arrangements. The Trust has made
certain mortgage loans that, because of their nature, qualify as loan
receivables. At the time the loans were made the Trust did not intend for the
arrangement to be anything other than a financing and did not contemplate a real
estate investment. Using guidance set forth in the Third Notice to Practitioners
issued by the AICPA in February 1986 entitled "ADC Arrangements" ("the Third
Notice"), the Trust evaluates each investment to determine whether the loan
arrangement qualifies under the Third Notice as a loan, joint venture or real
estate investment and the appropriate accounting thereon; such determination
affects the Trust's balance sheet classification of these investments and the
recognition of interest income derived therefrom. Generally, the Trust receives
additional interest on these loans, however the Trust never receives in excess
of 50% of the residual profit in the project (as defined in the Third Notice)
and because the borrower has either a substantial investment in the project or
has guaranteed all or a portion of the Trust's loan (or a combination thereof)
the loans qualify for loan accounting. The amounts under ADC arrangements at
December 31, 2000 and 1999 are $47.4 million and $53.5 million, respectively and
interest income recognized thereon was $5.0 million and $5.7 million,
respectively.

Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are prepared
using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Comprehensive Income. The Trust has no comprehensive income and therefore does
not require separate reporting in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

                                       F9


Earnings Per Share. The Trust calculates basic and diluted earnings per share in
accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share". Basic EPS excludes dilution
and is computed by dividing net income available for common shareholders by the
weighted number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted into common shares
and then shared in the earnings of the Trust.

     The following table sets forth the reconciliation between basic and diluted
EPS (in thousands):

                         ==========      ========         ========

          During 2000, the Trust expended cash of $23.6 million to acquire real
estate and an additional $145.8 million to improve, redevelop and develop its
existing real estate. The Trust purchased the 75,000 square foot Greenlawn Plaza
in Greenlawn, New York for $6.2 million. Control of a parcel of land for future
development in Hillsboro, Oregon was acquired for $11.7 million; an additional
$1.6 million will be owed if certain cash flow criteria are met during the first
ten years of operations. Other acquisitions include a parcel of land in
Bethesda, Maryland for $461,000; an additional property for the Trust's Houston
Street project in San Antonio, Texas for cash of $1.2 million and the assumption
of a $345,000 mortgage; a retail building in Santa Monica, California in
satisfaction of a $5.2 million mortgage note receivable and cash of $1.7
million; and the $2.3 million redemption of 100,000 operating partnership units
which had been issued in connection with the purchase of Courthouse Square and
Magruders Shopping Centers.

      Of the $145.8 million spent in 2000 on the Trust's existing real estate
portfolio, approximately $82.1 million was invested in development projects in
Bethesda, Maryland; San Jose, California; and in Arlington, Virginia. The
remaining $63.7 million of capital expenditures relates to improvements to
common areas, tenant work and various redevelopments, including the renovation
of Greenlawn Plaza, the office expansion and retenanting of Willow Lawn Shopping
Center, the renovation of Brunswick Shopping Center, and the redevelopment of
retail buildings in Forest Hills, New York, San Antonio, Texas and southern
California.

      The Trust, which held the 1% general partnership interest, obtained

                                      F11


an additional 98% general partnership interest in the future operations of
Loehmann's Plaza. The minority partner received 190,000 partnership units valued
at $3.6 million and the satisfaction of amounts due the Trust from the
partnership.

     The Trust's 123 retail properties at December 31, 2000 are located in 15
states and the District of Columbia. There are approximately 2,100 tenants
providing a wide range of retail products and services. These tenants range from
sole proprietorships to national retailers; no one tenant or corporate group of
tenants accounts for more than 2.1% of revenue.

     Mortgage notes receivable of $47.4 million are due over various terms from
January 2001 to May 2021 and have an average weighted interest rate of 10.0%.
Under the terms of certain of these mortgages, the Trust will receive additional
interest based upon the gross income of the secured properties and, upon sale of
the properties, the Trust will share in the appreciation of the properties.

     On June 30, 2000, the Trust sold the 296,000 square foot Peninsula Shopping
Center located in Palos Verdes, California for $48.6 million resulting in a gain
of $3.7 million.

     During the second quarter of 1999,the Trust recorded a $7.1 million charge,
representing the estimated loss on the potential sale of certain assets,
principally Northeast Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia. On October 18, 1999 the Trust
sold Northeast Plaza for $19.6 million, realizing a loss of $6.3 million.

     Mortgages payable and capital lease obligations are due in installments
over various terms extending to 2016 and 2060, respectively, with interest rates
ranging from 5.5% to 11.25%. Certain of the capital lease obligations require
additional interest payments based upon property performance. There were no
maturing mortgages in 2000 or 1999. In 1998 the Trust paid off maturing
mortgages totaling $53.5 million.

     On October 23, 2000, the Trust obtained a $152 million mortgage loan which
is secured by five shopping centers. The mortgage, which bears interest at
7.95%, matures November 1, 2015 and required an up-front fee of $988,000. The
loan provides for interest only payments for the initial three years, then
monthly principal and interest payments based on a twenty-seven year
amortization schedule until the maturity date. The proceeds from the mortgage
loan were used to pay down the Trust's syndicated credit facility.

     In anticipation of the mortgage loan placement in the third quarter of
2000, the Trust purchased a Treasury Yield Hedge (notional amount of $140
million) to hedge the risk of changes in interest rates. The hedge was
terminated on June 30, 2000 at a gain of $165,000 which is being recognized as a
reduction of interest expense over the term of the mortgage loan.

Leasing Arrangements
- --------------------

     The Trust's leases with retail property and apartment tenants are
classified as operating leases. Leases on apartments are generally for a period
of one year, whereas retail property leases generally range from three to 10
years (certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer), and usually provide
for contingent rentals based on sales and sharing of certain operating costs.

NOTE 2. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- -------------------------------------------

     The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by the
Trust, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimates of fair value. The
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that
could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.

     The Trust estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using the
following methods and assumptions: (1) quoted market prices, when available, are
used to estimate the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity
securities; (2) quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of the
Trust's marketable convertible subordinated debentures; (3) discounted cash flow
analyses are used to estimate the fair value of mortgage notes receivable and
payable, using the Trust's estimate of current interest rates for similar notes;
(4) carrying amounts in the balance sheet approximate fair value for cash,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and short term borrowings. Notes receivable
from officers are excluded from fair value estimation since they have been
issued in connection with employee stock ownership programs.

     In December 1997 the Trust obtained a five year syndicated revolving credit
facility for $300 million due December 2002. The syndicated facility requires
fees and has various covenants including the maintenance of a minimum
shareholders' equity and a maximum ratio of debt to net worth.

     In December 1998 the Trust obtained a four year loan of $125 million from
five institutional lenders. The loan, due December 2002, requires fees and has
the same covenants as the syndicated credit facility.

     In June 2000, the Trust modified certain covenants and extended the
maturity date to December 19, 2003 of its syndicated credit facility and its
$125 million term loan. Fees paid for this extension totaled $1.0 million. The
Trust is in compliance with all covenants.

     In July 2000, citing the Trust's pursuit of development and the resulting
capital requirements, Standard and Poor's lowered the rating on the Trust's
senior notes from BBB+ to BBB flat with a positive outlook. Under the terms of
the syndicated credit facility, this lowered rating resulted in an increase in
the Trust's borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 65 basis points to LIBOR plus 80
basis points. The interest rate on the term loan increased from LIBOR plus 75
basis points to LIBOR plus 95 basis points.

     The maximum drawn under these facilities during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$343.1 million, $330.0 million and $259.1 million, respectively. In 2000, 1999
and 1998 the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 7.2%, 5.9% and
6.1%, respectively, and the average amount outstanding was $283.2 million,
$296.4 million and $163.6 million, respectively.

     On February 29, 2000, the Trust obtained a construction loan for up to
$24.5 million in connection with the Trust's Woodmont East development in
Bethesda, Maryland. The loan, which has a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus
1.2% to 1.5%, depending on occupancy levels, matures August 29, 2002 with two
one-year extension options. At December 31, 2000, the outstanding balance on the
construction loan was $16.2 million. No principal payments are due until
maturity. The property secures the construction loan facility.

                                      F16


     In connection with the land held for future development in Hillsboro,
Oregon, the Trust issued a $3.4 million note which is due June 30, 2001. The
loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.25%. The property secures the loan facility.

NOTE 4. 5 1/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES
- --------------------------------------------------

     In October 1993 the Trust issued $75.0 million of 5 1/4% convertible
subordinated debentures, realizing cash proceeds of approximately $73.0 million.
The debentures were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and were
not publicly distributed within the United States. The debentures, which mature
in 2003, are convertible into shares of beneficial interest at $36 per share.
The debentures are redeemable by the Trust, in whole, at any time after October
28, 1998 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest.

     At December 2000 and 1999 the Trust had outstanding $289,000 of 5 1/4%
convertible subordinated debentures due 2002. The debentures which are
convertible into shares of beneficial interest at $30.625 were not registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 and were not publicly distributed within the
United States.

     The Trust is in compliance with the terms of these borrowings. No principal
is due on these notes prior to maturity.

     In September 1998 the Trust filed a $500 million shelf registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which allows the issuance
of debt securities, preferred shares and common shares. As of December 31, 2000,
$325 million is available under the shelf registration.

 NOTE 6. DIVIDENDS
 -----------------

     On November 2, 2000 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.47
per common share, payable January 15, 2001 to common shareholders of record
January 2, 2001. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, $.11,
$.16, and $.31 of dividends paid per common share, respectively, represented a
return of capital.

     On November 2, 2000 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$.49687 per share on its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares,
payable on January 31, 2001 to shareholders of record on January 15, 2001.

     For the year ended December 31, 2000, $.04 of dividends paid per common
share and per preferred share represent a capital gain. There were no capital
gains in 1999 or 1998.

NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- -------------------------------------

     Pentagon Row is a mixed-use project with the retail component being
developed by the Trust and the residential component being developed by an
unrelated residential developer. In October 2000 the general contractor on the
project was replaced by the Trust and the residential developer, because of
schedule delays and other events that caused the Trust and the residential
developer to conclude that the original contractor was either unable or
unwilling to comply with its contractual obligations. The Trust and the
residential developer filed suit against the original contractor to recover
damages that they anticipate they will incur as a result of defaults under the
contract. The original contractor filed a counter-claim against the Trust and
the residential developer for damages of $7 million plus interest, attorneys'
fees and litigation costs. The Trust believes that the counterclaim is generally
without merit and that the outcome of the counterclaim will not have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or on the
project. Work continues under the direction of the new general contractor and
the Trust does not believe that there will be any material impairment on the
project as a result of the schedule delays.

     In addition, the Trust is involved in various other lawsuits and
environmental matters arising in the normal course of business. Management
believes that such matters will not have a material effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of the Trust.

     Pursuant to the provisions of the Congressional Plaza partnership
agreement, in the event of the exercise of put options by another partner, which
are currently exercisable and have no expiration date, the Trust would be
required to purchase a 37.5% interest at Congressional Plaza at its then fair
market value. Based on management's current estimate of fair market value, the
Trust's estimated liability upon exercise of the put option is approximately $27
million.

     Under the terms of six other partnership agreements, if certain leasing and
revenue levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships, the
limited partners may require the Trust to purchase their partnership interests
at a formula price based upon net operating income. The purchase price may be
paid in cash or a limited number of common shares of the Trust, at the election
of the limited partners. In certain of the partnerships if the limited partners
do not redeem their interest, the Trust may choose to purchase the limited
partnership interests upon the same terms.

     The limited partners of two partnerships, owning street retail properties
in southern California, have exercised their rights under these agreements. The
Trust purchased their interests in March 2001 for approximately $18 million,
approximately $7 million in common shares of the Trust and the balance in cash.

     Under the terms of certain other partnership agreements, the partners may
exchange their 904,589 operating partnership units for cash or exchange into the
same number of common shares of the Trust, at the option of the Trust. During
the third quarter of 2000 the Trust redeemed 100,000 operating units for cash of
$2.3 million

     As of December 31, 2000 in connection with renovation and development
projects, the Trust has contractual obligations of approximately $46 million.

     The Trust is obligated under ground lease agreements on several shopping

NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
- ----------------------------

     In May 1999, the Trust reorganized as a Maryland real estate investment
trust by amending and restating its declaration of trust and bylaws. The Amended
Declaration of Trust changed the number of authorized shares of common and
preferred shares from unlimited to 100,000,000 and 15,000,000, respectively. In
addition, all common shares of beneficial

                                      F19


interest, no par value, which were issued and outstanding were changed to common
shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share and all Series A
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of beneficial interest, no par value,
which were issued and outstanding were changed to Series A Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share.

     On October 6, 1997 the Trust issued four million 7.95% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Shares at $25 per share in a public offering, realizing
cash proceeds of approximately $96.6 million after costs of $3.4 million. The
Series A Preferred Shares are not redeemable prior to October 6, 2002. On or
after that date, the Preferred Shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at
the option of the Trust, at a redemption price of $25 per share plus all accrued
and unpaid dividends. The redemption price is payable solely out of proceeds
from the sale of other capital shares of the Trust. Dividends on the Preferred
Shares are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of January, April, July
and October.

     The Trust has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, whereby shareholders may use
their dividends and make optional cash payments to purchase shares. In 2000,
1999, and 1998, 153,713 shares, 165,770 shares, and 167,511 shares,
respectively, were issued under the Plan.

     In December 1999, the Trustees authorized a share repurchase program for
calendar year 2000 of up to an aggregate of 4 million of the Trust's common
shares. A total of 1,325,900 shares were repurchased, at a cost of $25.2
million. The Trust does not expect to repurchase shares in 2001.

     In 2000, 270,809 common shares were awarded to the Trust's president and
other key employees under various incentive compensation programs designed to
directly link a significant portion of their current and long term compensation
to the prosperity of the Trust and its shareholders. The shares vest over terms
from 3 to 8 years.

     In 1999, 65,660 common shares were awarded, and 5,006 shares were forfeited
and retired, to the Trust's president and other key employees under various
incentive compensation programs. Fifteen thousand shares vested upon award, and
the balance vest over terms from 5 to 13 years.

     In 1998, 576,055 common shares, of which 35,000 were issued from treasury
shares, were awarded to the Trust's president and certain other officers under
various incentive compensation programs. Ten thousand shares vested upon award,
491,055 shares vest over terms from 5 to 13 years, and 75,000 shares vest upon
the obtainment of certain performance criteria.

     In January 1994 under the terms of the 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan, an
officer of the Trust purchased 40,000 common shares at $25 per share with the
assistance of a $1.0 million loan from the Trust. The loan, which has a term of
12 years and a current balance of $562,500, bears interest at

                                      F20


6.24%. Forgiveness of up to 75% of the loan is subject to the future performance
of the Trust. One eighth of the loan was forgiven on January 31, 1995 and an
additional one sixteenth has been forgiven each January 31 since then as certain
performance criteria of the Trust were met.

     In January 1991 the Trustees adopted the Federal Realty Investment Trust
Share Purchase Plan. Under the terms of this plan, officers and certain
employees of the Trust purchased 446,000 common shares at $15.125 per share with
the assistance of loans of $6.7 million from the Trust. Originally, the Plan
called for one sixteenth of the loan to be forgiven each year for eight years,
as long as the participant was still employed by the Trust. The loans for all
participants, but two, were modified in 1994 to extend the term an additional
four years and to tie forgiveness in 1995 and thereafter to certain performance
criteria of the Trust. One sixteenth of the loan has been forgiven during each
year of the plan. At December 31, 2000 the Trust has outstanding purchase loans
to participants of $1.4 million. The purchase loans bear interest at 9.39%. The
shares purchased under the plan may not be sold, pledged or assigned until both
the purchase and tax loans associated with the plan are satisfied and the term
has expired, without the consent of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Trustees.

     Tax loans with a balance of $2.2 million in 2000, $1.3 million in 1999 and
$1.1 million in 1998 have been made in connection with restricted share grants
to the Trust's President, Chief Investment Officer and Chief Operating Officer
and in connection with the Share Purchase Plans. The loans, which bear interest
ranging from 6.36% to 9.39%, are due over periods ranging from 8 to 13 years
from the date of the loan.

     On April 13, 1999, the Shareholder Rights Plan adopted in 1989 expired. On
March 11, 1999 the Trust entered into an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement
with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, pursuant to which (i)the
expiration date of the Trust's shareholder rights plan was extended for an
additional ten years to April 24, 2009, (ii)the beneficial ownership percentage
at which a person becomes an "Acquiring Person" under the plan was reduced from
20% to 15%, and (iii)certain other amendments were made.

NOTE 9. STOCK OPTION PLAN
- -------------------------

     The 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan ("Plan") has been amended to authorize
the grant of options and other stock based awards for up to 5.5 million shares.
Options granted under the Plan have ten year terms and vest in one to five
years. Under the Plan, on each annual meeting date during the term of the Plan,
each nonemployee Trustee will be awarded 2,500 options.

     The option price to acquire shares under the 1993 Plan and previous plans
is required to be at least the fair market value at the date of grant. As a
result of the exercise of options, the Trust had outstanding from its officers
and employees notes for $2.6 million, $3.6 million and $3.4


                                      F21


million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The notes issued
under the 1993 Plan bear interest at the dividend rate on the date of exercise
divided by the purchase price of such shares. The notes issued under the
previous plans bear interest at the lesser of (i) the Trust's borrowing rate or
(ii) the current indicated annual dividend rate on the shares acquired pursuant
to the option, divided by the purchase price of such shares. The notes are
collateralized by the shares and are with recourse. The loans have a term
extending to the employee's or officer's retirement date.

     SFAS Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" requires
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share as if the
Trust accounted for its stock options under the fair value method of that
Statement. The fair value for options issued in 2000, 1999, and 1998 has been
estimated as $549,000, $434,000, and $2.6 million, respectively, as of the date
of grant, using a binomial model with the following weighted-average assumptions
for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 5.2%,
5.4%,and 5.7%; volatility factors of the expected market price of the Trust's
shares of 14%, 15%, and 19%; and a weighted average expected life of the option
of 5.7 years, 6.6 years, and 6.3 years.

     Because option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, such as the expected stock price volatility, and because changes in
these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, the existing model may not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its stock options.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
are amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The pro forma
information is as follows (in thousands except for earnings per share):

                                      2000      1999     1998

Pro forma net income                 $59,445   $46,368 $43,179
Pro forma earnings per share, basic    $1.33      $.97    $.90
Pro forma earnings per share, diluted  $1.32      $.97    $.88

price of options outstanding at December 31, 2000 ranged from $18.00 per share
to $27.13 per share.

NOTE 10. SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLANS
- -------------------------------------

     The Trust has a savings and retirement plan in accordance with the
provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees'
contributions range, at the discretion of each employee, from 1% to 20% of
compensation up to a maximum of $10,500. Under the plan, the Trust, out of its
current net income, contributes 50% of each employee's first 5% of
contributions. In addition, the Trust may make discretionary contributions
within the limits of deductibility set forth by the Code. Employees of the Trust
are immediately eligible to become plan participants. Employees are not eligible
to receive matching contributions until their first anniversary of employment.
The Trust's expense for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$216,000, $223,000 and $218,000, respectively.

     A nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Trust officers was
established in 1994. The plan allows the officers to defer future income until
the earlier of age 65 or termination of employment with the Trust. As of
December 31, 2000, the Trust is liable to participants for approximately $2.4
million under this plan. Although this is an unfunded

                                      F23


plan, the Trust has purchased certain investments with which to match this
obligation.

NOTE 11. INTEREST EXPENSE
- -------------------------

     The Trust incurred interest expense totaling $79.7 million, $68.4 million
and $60.2 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, of which $13.3 million,
$6.9 million, and $5.1 million respectively, was capitalized. Interest paid was
$83.1 million in 2000, $67.0 million in 1999, and $57.8 million in 1998.

NOTE 12. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
- --------------------------------

     During 1999 while exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder
value, the Trust considered spinning off certain of its assets (primarily those
related to the development and operation of its main street retail program) in a
taxable transaction to shareholders. Shortly thereafter, the remaining assets of
the Trust were to be merged with another publicly traded shopping center company
in exchange for cash and stock consideration. On September 24, 1999, the Trust
announced that merger negotiations were terminated and that the spin-off was
being reevaluated.

     In preparing for these transactions, the Trust incurred expenses of
approximately $2.8 million related to legal, accounting, tax and other advisory
services related to the spin-off and the merger. Such costs have been expensed
and are reflected as administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations


     At September 30, 1998 the Trust recorded a $4.7 million charge related to a
comprehensive restructuring program, the implementation of which was begun
during the fourth quarter of 1998. All costs related to the reorganization have
been expended as of December 31, 2000.

NOTE 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
- --------------------------

     Under a Restricted Share Agreement designed to link his compensation with
the prosperity of the shareholders, the Trust's Chief Executive Officer elected
to accept stock in lieu of cash for both his 2000 bonus and his 2001 salary. As
a result, in 2001, 35,000 common shares were awarded to the Chief Executive
Officer in lieu of his 2001 cash salary and 26,869 shares were awarded in lieu
of his 2000 cash bonus. The shares vest at the end of five years if the Chief
Executive Officer is still employed by the Trust.

     Pursuant to the 1999 Incentive Bonus Plan, vice presidents and certain
key employees receive part of their 2000 bonus in Federal Realty shares which
vest over three years. Consequently, on February 14, 2001, 23,390 shares were
awarded under this plan.

                                      F24


     On February 16, 2001, the Trust bought the land underlying the capital
lease obligation, thereby, terminating the capital lease on Brick Plaza in
Brick, New Jersey for $28 million. Concurrent with this transaction, the
mortgage note receivable of $3.2 million owed to the Trust by the lessor was
repaid.

NOTE 14. SEGMENT INFORMATION
- ----------------------------

     The Trust traditionally operated its business as a single business segment.
During the fourth quarter of 1998, however, the Trust completed a comprehensive
restructuring program which, among other things, divided its portfolio of assets
into three geographic operating regions: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West.

                                      F25
