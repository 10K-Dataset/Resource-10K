  PART I & II
  -----------

  Item 1.   Business
  -------   --------


       Federal Realty Investment Trust is an owner, operator and redeveloper of
  retail properties.  Founded in 1962 as a District of Columbia business trust
  of unlimited duration, the Trust is a self-administered equity real estate
  investment trust.  The Trust consolidates the financial statements of one
  wholly owned subsidiary, eight partnerships and a joint venture.  At December
  31, 1995 the Trust owned 70 retail properties and one apartment complex.

       The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
  estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856- 860 of the Internal Revenue
  Code.  Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 95% of its real
  estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which
  meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its
  taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  Therefore, no
  provision for Federal income taxes is required.

       An important part of the Trust's strategy is to acquire older, well-
  located  properties in prime, densely populated and affluent areas and to
  enhance their operating performance through a program of renovation,
  expansion, reconfiguration and retenanting.  The Trust's traditional focus has
  been on community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by
  supermarkets, drug stores or high volume, value oriented retailers that
  provide consumer necessities.  Late in 1994 the Trust expanded this strategy
  to include retail buildings and shopping centers in prime established main
  street shopping areas.  The Trust continually evaluates its properties for
  renovation, retenanting and expansion opportunities.  Similarly, the Trust
  regularly reviews its portfolio and from time to time considers selling
  certain of its properties.

       The Trust's portfolio of properties has increased from 44 as of January
  1, 1991 to 71 at December 31, 1995.  During this five year period the Trust
  acquired 31 retail properties for approximately $305.3 million. Six of the
  acquisitions were in the Chicago, Illinois area and three were in the Boston,
  Massachusetts area, both of which are markets the Trust entered during the
  past five years. During this same period four shopping centers were sold. Also
  during this period the Trust spent over $145 million to renovate, expand,
  improve and retenant its properties.  One of the retail properties acquired
  during the last five years was acquired by means of capital and ground leases,
  one was acquired for common shares of the Trust as well as the assumption of a
  mortgage and the remainder were acquired primarily for cash.  This growth was
  financed through borrowing and equity offerings, since each year the Trust has
  distributed all or the majority of its cash provided by operating activities
  to its shareholders.

      The Trust's 70 retail properties, consisting of 55 shopping centers and 15
  main street retail buildings, are located in 13


 
  states and the District of Columbia, primarily along the East Coast between
  the Boston metropolitan area and Richmond, Virginia.  Nineteen of the shopping
  centers are located in the  Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; ten are in
  Pennsylvania, primarily in the Philadelphia area; nine are in New Jersey; five
  are in Illinois; three are in Virginia; two are in Massachusetts; and there is
  one in each of the following states, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana,
  Michigan, New York, North Carolina and Tennessee.  No single property accounts
  for over 10% of the Trust's revenues.

       The Trust has over 1,700 tenants, ranging from sole proprietors to major
  national retailers; no one tenant or corporate group of tenants accounts for
  5% or more of revenue.  The Trust's leases with these tenants are classified
  as operating leases and typically are structured to include minimum rents,
  percentage rents based on tenants' sales volumes and reimbursement of certain
  operating expenses and real estate taxes.

       The Trust intends to continue its strategy of acquiring older, well-
  located shopping centers and retail buildings and then enhancing their revenue
  potential through a program of renovation, retenanting and remerchandising.
  The Trust is also studying sites which are suitable for the development of new
  shopping centers.  During the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
  retail properties have contributed 96%, 95% and 94%, respectively of the
  Trust's total revenue.

       The Trust is currently limited to investing east of the Mississippi
  River;  to change this limitation requires Trustee approval.  Investments are
  not required to be based on specific allocation by type of property.  The
  extent to which the Trust might mortgage or otherwise finance investments
  varies with the investment involved and the economic climate.

       The success of the Trust depends upon, among other factors, the trends of
  the economy, including interest rates, construction costs, retailing trends,
  income tax laws, increases or decreases in operating expenses, governmental
  regulations, population trends, zoning laws, legislation and the ability of
  the Trust to keep its properties leased at profitable levels.  The Trust
  competes for tenants with other real estate owners and the Trust's properties
  account for only a small fraction of the retail space available for lease.
  The Trust competes for investment opportunities and debt and equity capital
  with individuals, partnerships, corporations, financial institutions, life
  insurance companies, pension funds, trust funds and other real estate
  investment trusts.

       Investments in real property create a potential for environmental
  liability on the part of the current and previous owners of, or any mortgage
  lender on, such real property.  If hazardous substances are discovered on or
  emanating from any property, the owner or operator of the property may be held
  liable for costs and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances.  The
  Trust's current policy is to obtain an environmental study on each property it
  seeks to acquire.  On recent acquisitions, any substances identified prior to
  closing


 
  which present an immediate environmental hazard have been or are in the
  process of remediation.  Costs related to the abatement of asbestos which
  increase the value of Trust properties are capitalized.  Other costs are
  expensed.  In 1995 approximately $1.0 million, of which $796,000 was
  capitalized abatement costs, was spent on environmental matters.  The Trust
  has budgeted approximately $2.0 million for 1996 for environmental matters, a
  majority of which is projected for asbestos abatement.  (See Note 6 of Notes
  to Consolidated Financial Statements.)


  Current Developments
  --------------------

       In 1995 the Trust purchased 20 retail properties. Finley Square Shopping
  Center in suburban Chicago, Illinois was purchased for approximately $18.8
  million in cash; Bristol Shopping Center in Bristol, Connecticut was purchased
  for $19.6 million, by assuming a $11.3 million mortgage and by issuing common
  shares valued at $7.3 million with the balance in cash; Park & Shop Center in
  Washington, D.C. was purchased for $11.2 million in cash; and Shirlington
  Shopping Center in Arlington, Virginia was purchased for $23.5 million in
  cash.  Retail building acquisitions during 1995 were as follows: seven
  buildings in West Hartford, Connecticut for $15.3 million; two buildings in
  Greenwich,Connecticut for $14.9 million; one building in Westport, Connecticut
  for $5.7 million; one building in Brookline, Massachusetts for $3.8 million;
  one building in Westfield, New Jersey for $2.2 million; two buildings in
  Evanston, Illinois for $3.6 million; and a building contiguous to Bethesda Row
  in Bethesda, Maryland for $2.0 million.  In addition, the Trust purchased a
  building abutting Flourtown Shopping Center, one of its existing centers, for
  $3.1 million.

       The Trust continued its strategy of renovating, expanding and retenanting
  its centers in 1995, spending approximately $33.8 million.  These improvements
  included an additional $3.8 million on the redevelopment of Congressional
  Plaza in Rockville, Maryland, $5.5 million to complete the redevelopment and
  retenanting of Gaithersburg Square in Gaithersburg, Maryland and $5.8 million
  for the renovation of Brick Plaza in Brick, New Jersey.

       The Trust funded its 1995 acquisitions, capital improvement projects and
  major debt repayment requirements primarily through three issues of senior
  notes, totalling $165.0 million.  The notes bear interest at rates ranging
  from 6.625% to 8.875% and mature from 2000 to 2005.

       At December 31, 1995 the Trust had 195 full-time employees.

  (1) Determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
  Statement No. 95.

  (2) Defined as income before  depreciation and amortization of real estate
  assets and before extraordinary items and significant nonrecurring events less
  gains on sale of real estate. Funds from operations differs from net cash
  provided by operating activities primarily because funds from operations does
  not include changes in operating assets and liabilities.  Funds from
  operations is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net
  income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating
  activities as a measure of liquidity.


 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
  Operations

  Liquidity and Capital Resources
  -------------------------------

       Federal Realty meets its liquidity requirements through net cash provided
  by operating activities, long term borrowing through debt offerings and
  mortgages, medium and short term borrowing under revolving credit facilities,
  and equity offerings. Because all or a significant portion of the Trust's net
  cash provided by operating activities is distributed to shareholders, capital
  outlays for property acquisitions, renovation projects and debt repayments
  require funding from borrowing or equity offerings.

       Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $35.2 million in
  1993 to $45.2 million in 1994 to $65.1 million in 1995. The major source of
  the $10.0 million increase from 1993 to 1994 was an increase in net income of
  $2.3 million and an increase of $4.4 million in depreciation and amortization.
  The $19.9 million increase from 1994 to 1995 resulted primarily from a $2.6
  million increase in net income, a $5.1 million increase in depreciation and
  amortization and a $12.9 million increase in cash provided by changes in
  operating assets and liabilities.  Dividends paid in cash were $38.1 million
  in 1993, $44.0 million in 1994 and $47.9 million in 1995.

       In 1995 net cash provided by operating activities was comprised primarily
  of $23.1 million in net income increased by $34.9 million of depreciation and
  amortization and $6.1 million of cash provided by changes in operating assets
  and liabilities.  In 1994 net cash provided by operating activities was
  primarily comprised of $20.5 million in net income increased by $29.8 million
  in depreciation and amortization and decreased by cash used for operating
  assets and liabilities of $6.8 million.  In 1993 net cash provided by
  operating activities was comprised primarily of $18.1 million in net income
  increased by $25.4 million of depreciation and amortization and decreased by
  $6.4 million of cash used for operating assets and liabilities.

       During the period 1993 through 1995, the Trust spent over $370 million to
  acquire properties and  to improve its  properties.  These expenditures were
  primarily funded from the proceeds of various debt and equity transactions.

       In 1995 the Trust purchased 19 retail properties.  The Trust also
  purchased a building abutting Flourtown Shopping Center, one of its existing
  centers, for $3.1 million.  The 302,000 square foot Finley Square Shopping
  Center in suburban Chicago, Illinois was purchased on April 27, 1995 for
  approximately $18.8 million in cash; the 284,000 square foot Bristol Shopping
  Center in Bristol, Connecticut was purchased on September 22, 1995 for $19.6
  million, by assuming a $11.3 million mortgage and by issuing common shares
  valued at $7.3 million with the balance in cash; the 47,000 square foot Park &
  Shop Center in Washington, D.C. was purchased on December 1, 1995 for $11.2
  million in cash; and on December 21, 1995 the 349,000 square foot Shirlington
  Shopping Center in Arlington, Virginia was purchased for $23.5 million in
  cash.  The


 
  retail building acquisitions during 1995 were as follows: seven buildings in
  West Hartford, Connecticut for $15.3 million; two buildings in Greenwich,
  Connecticut for $14.9 million; one building in Westport, Connecticut for $5.7
  million; one building in Brookline, Massachusetts for $3.8 million; one
  building in Westfield, New Jersey for $2.2 million; two buildings in Evanston,
  Illinois for $3.6 million; and a building contiguous to Bethesda Row in
  Bethesda, Maryland for $2.0 million.
 
       During 1995 $33.8 million was expended on improvements to Trust
  properties.  These improvements included $3.8 million on the redevelopment of
  Congressional Plaza in Rockville, Maryland, $5.5 million to complete the
  redevelopment and retenanting of Gaithersburg Square in Gaithersburg, Maryland
  and $5.8 million for the renovation of Brick Plaza in Brick, New Jersey.

       During 1994 the Trust purchased four shopping centers and one retail
  building, Idylwood Plaza in Falls Church, Virginia, North Lake Commons in Lake
  Zurich, Illinois, Garden Market Shopping Center in Western Springs, Illinois,
  Queen Anne Plaza in Norwell, Massachusetts and the Ship's Building in
  Westport, Connecticut. In addition, the Trust purchased a 3.9 acre parcel of
  land, on which there is a supermarket, which adjoins its Bala Cynwyd Shopping
  Center. These properties were acquired for a total cash investment of $48.3
  million and a $1.1 million note.

       During 1994, $42.3 million was expended on improvements to Trust
  properties.  These improvements included $15.5 million on the renovation and
  expansion of Congressional Plaza in Rockville, Maryland, $4.1 million to
  complete the redevelopment of Ellisburg Circle Shopping Center in Cherry Hill,
  New Jersey, and $3.9 million to begin the redevelopment and retenanting of
  Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

       In 1993 the Trust spent $101.8 million to acquire six shopping centers
  (Gaithersburg Square and Quince Orchard Shopping Centers in Gaithersburg,
  Maryland, Pan Am Shopping Center in Fairfax, Virginia, Crossroads Shopping
  Center in Highland Park, Illinois, Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center in suburban
  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Dedham Plaza in Dedham, Massachusetts), $6.2
  million in connection with the long term lease of Bethesda Row in Bethesda,
  Maryland, and $34.3 million in improvements to its properties.

       These acquisitions and improvements, as well as  debt repayment
  requirements, were funded through a variety of equity and debt issues.  During
  1995 the Trust issued $165 million of senior notes: $100.0 million at 8 7/8%
  interest in January  netting proceeds of approximately $98.9 million; $25.0
  million  at 8% interest in April, netting approximately $24.9 million; and
  $40.0 million at 6 5/8% interest in December, netting approximately $39.6
  million. In January 1995 the Trust repaid a $22.5 million mortgage which had
  been borrowed in 1994 and a $1.1 million note issued in connection with the
  purchase of Queen Anne Plaza in 1994.

       In order to protect itself against the risk that the general level of
  interest rates for senior notes would rise before the senior notes were priced
  in January 1995, the Trust entered into two interest rate hedge agreements in
  December 1994 on a total principal


 
  amount of $75.0 million.  The cost of the agreements, which terminated on
  January 20, 1995, was $21,000, which is being amortized into interest expense
  over the life of the notes.

       In January 1995 in connection with the issuance of the $100.0 million of
  senior notes, the Trust executed a five year interest rate swap on $25.0
  million, whereby the Trust swappped fixed interest payment obligations of 8.1%
  for a floating rate interest payment of three month LIBOR (London Interbank
  Offered Rate).  The floating rate during the first quarter of 1995 was 6.2%.
  In May 1995 the swap was terminated and the Trust sold the swap for $1.5
  million, which is being amortized as a deduction to interest expense over the
  remaining term.
 
       In April 1994 the Trust raised net proceeds of $61.3 million from a
  public offering of 2.5 million common shares of beneficial interest
  ("shares").  In a concurrent offering of 840,000 shares to an institutional
  investor, the Trust raised net proceeds of $21.7 million.  In April 1994 the
  Trust redeemed $39.8 million principal amount of its 5 1/4% convertible
  subordinated debentures due 2002 at a price equal to 120% of their principal
  amount or $47.8 million.  In November 1994 the Trust spent $4.2 million to
  exercise the option to purchase the land at Northeast Shopping Center, $3.4
  million of which had been recorded as a capital lease obligation.

       In April 1993, 2.8 million shares were issued in a public offering,
  netting proceeds of $72.8 million.  In December 1993 another 220,000 shares
  were issued for $5.4 million in a private placement in connection with the
  long term lease of Bethesda Row. The Trust called its 8 3/4% convertible
  subordinated debentures and its 8.65% Senior Notes for redemption in 1993.
  The Trust redeemed $173,000 principal amount of the 8 3/4% debentures at a
  price of $1017.50 per debenture on March 15; the balance of the debentures
  that had been outstanding or $2.2 million were converted into shares.  The
  senior notes were redeemed on May 14, at a price of $1010 for a total
  redemption price of $50.5 million.  In October 1993 the Trust issued $75.0
  million of 5 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures, realizing cash proceeds
  of approximately $73.0 million. The debentures, which mature in 2003, are
  convertible into shares at $36 per share.

       At December 31, 1995 and 1994 the Trust had $130 million of unsecured
  medium term revolving credit facilities with four banks.  The facilities
  require fees and have covenants requiring a minimum shareholders' equity and a
  maximum ratio of debt to net worth.  The Trust uses these facilities to fund
  acquisitions and other cash requirements until conditions are favorable for
  issuing equity or long term debt.  At December 31, 1995 there was $40.1
  million drawn under these facilities; the maximum amount borrowed under these
  facilities during 1995 was $66.8 million.  Amounts advanced under these
  facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 - 100 basis points; the weighted
  average interest rate on borrowings during 1995 was 6.9%.  At December 31,
  1994 there was $54.7 million drawn under these facilities, which was the
  maximum drawn during 1994. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings
  during 1994 was 5.6%.

       At December 1993 the Trust had $70.0 million of unsecured medium term
  revolving credit facilities with three banks.  The


 
  maximum drawn under these facilities in 1993 was $64.1 million and at December
  31, 1993, there was $24.4 million outstanding.  The weighted average interest
  rate on borrowing during 1993 was 4.2%.

       The Trust has budgeted $48.0 million for capital improvements to its
  properties in 1996.  These improvements include: (1) $12.0  million at
  Congressional Plaza whose renovation has been expanded to include the
  construction of an additional 30,000 square feet of space; (2) $6.7 million to
  renovate and expand a portion of Bethesda Row; (3) $5.6 million to retenant
  and renovate a portion of Troy Shopping Center; and (4) $2.1 million to
  complete the retenanting of Brick Plaza.

       The Trust's long term debt has varying maturity dates and in a number of
  instances includes balloon payments or other contractual provisions that could
  require significant repayments during a particular period.  The next
  significant maturity is approximately $53.5 million of mortgage obligations
  which are due in 1998.

       The Trust intends to continue to acquire existing retail properties, both
  shopping centers and main street retail buildings. In addition, the Trust is
  searching for site acquisitions in its core markets to permit the Trust to
  build new shopping centers.

       The Trust will need additional capital in order to fund these
  acquisitions, expansions and refinancings.  Sources of this funding may be
  proceeds from the sale of existing properties, additional debt and additional
  equity.  The timing and choice between additional debt or equity will depend
  upon many factors, including the market price for the Trust's shares, interest
  rates and  the ratio of debt to net worth. The Trust believes that it will be
  able to raise this capital as needed, based on its past success in so doing.

  Contingencies
  -------------

       The State of New Jersey Division of Taxation  assessed the Trust $364,000
  in taxes, penalty and interest for the years 1985 through 1990, since the
  State disallowed the dividends paid deduction in computing New Jersey taxable
  income.  The Trust protested this assessment since the Trust believed that it
  was entitled to the deduction.  The case was dismissed in December 1995 in
  favor of the Trust.
 
       As previously reported, certain of the Trust's shopping centers have some
  environmental contamination.  The North Carolina Department of the
  Environment, Health and Natural Resources ("DEHNR") issued a Notice of
  Violation ("NOV") against a former dry cleaner tenant at Eastgate Shopping
  Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina concerning a spill at the shopping
  center.  As owner of the shopping center, the Trust was named in and received
  a copy of the NOV.  Estimates to remediate the spill range from $300,000 to
  $500,000.  The Trust has entered into an agreement with two previous owners of
  the shopping center to share the costs to assess and remediate.  In 1993 the
  Trust recorded a liability of $120,000 as its estimated share of the cleanup
  costs.


 
       In 1992 contaminants at levels in excess of New Jersey cleanup standards
  were identified at a shopping center in New Jersey.  The Trust has retained an
  environmental consultant to investigate the contamination.  The Trust is also
  evaluating whether it has insurance coverage for this matter.  At this time,
  the Trust has not determined what the range of remediation costs might be, but
  does not believe that the costs will have a material effect upon the Trust's
  financial condition.  The Trust has also identified chlorinated solvent
  contamination at another property. The contamination appears to be linked to
  the current and/or previous dry cleaner.  The Trust intends to look to the
  responsible parties for any remediation effort.  Evaluation of this situation
  is preliminary and it is impossible, at this time, to estimate the range of
  remediation costs, if any.

       On September 22, 1995 the Trust purchased the Bristol Shopping Center in
  Bristol, Connecticut.  Pursuant to an agreement executed at closing, the Trust
  agreed to perform all remedial measures necessary to obtain a final letter of
  compliance from the Connecticut Commissioner of Environmental Protection with
  respect to certain identified soil and ground water contamination associated
  with a former dry cleaning operation.  The seller established an escrow
  account at closing of $187,500 to cover such remedial measures and has
  indemnified the Trust in connection with the identified contamination.

       The Trust reserved $2.25 million at closing in 1993 for environmental
  issues principally associated with Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center.
  Pursuant to an indemnity agreement entered into with the seller at closing,
  the Trust agreed to take certain actions with respect to identified
  chlorinated solvent contamination.  The seller indemnified the Trust for
  certain third party claims and government requirements related to
  contamination at adjacent properties.  During the third quarter of 1995 the
  reserve was reduced by $269,000 with a corresponding reduction in the basis of
  land at one shopping center since the environmental issue there was resolved.

       Pursuant to the provisions of the respective partnership agreements, in
  the event of the exercise of put options by the other partners, the Trust
  would be required to purchase the 99% limited partnership interest at
  Loehmann's Plaza at its then fair market value and a 22.5% interest at
  Congressional Plaza at its then fair market value.

  Results of Operations
  ---------------------

       Net income and funds from operations have been affected by the Trust's
  recent acquisition and financing activities.  The Trust has historically
  reported its funds from operations in addition to its net income and net cash
  provided by operating activities.  Funds from operations is a supplemental
  measure of real estate companies' operating performance which excludes
  historical cost depreciation, since real estate values have historically risen
  and fallen with market conditions rather than over time.  Funds from
  operations was historically defined as income before depreciation and
  amortization and extraordinary items less gains on sale of real estate.  The
  National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT)


 
  issued a white paper during 1995, which has amended the definition as follows:
  income before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and before
  extraordinary items and significant non-recurring events less gains on sale of
  real estate.  The Trust is complying with this new definition and has
  consequently restated funds from operations for prior periods.  Funds from
  operations does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash
  provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Rather, funds
  from operations has been adopted by real estate investment trusts to provide a
  consistent measure of operating performance in the industry.

       The reconciliation of net income to funds from operations is as follows:


       The Trust's retail leases generally provide for minimum rents, with
  periodic increases.  Most retail tenants pay a majority of on-site operating
  expenses.  Many leases also contain a percentage rent clause which calls for
  additional rents based on tenant sales, so that at a given sales volume, if
  prices increase, so does rental income.  These features in the Trust leases
  reduce the Trust's exposure to higher costs caused by inflation, although
  inflation has not been significant in recent years.

       Rental income, which consists of minimum rent, percentage rent, and cost
  recoveries, increased 20.9%  from $105.9 million in 1993 to $128.1 million in
  1994 and 11.5% in 1995 to $142.8 million.  If centers acquired and sold in
  1993, 1994 and 1995 are excluded, rental income increased 6.1% from 1993 to
  1994 and 3.6% from 1994 to 1995.

       Minimum rents increased 19.4% in 1994 to $99.9 million  from $83.6
  million in 1993  and 14% in 1995 to $113.9 million. If centers acquired and
  sold in 1993, 1994 and 1995 are excluded, minimum rents increased 4.3% from
  1993 to 1994 and 6.2% from 1994 to 1995.  Thirty-four percent of the increase
  in minimum rent in 1995 was from Congressional Plaza whose occupancy has
  increased since its  redevelopment was substantially completed in late 1994.

       Cost reimbursements consist of tenant reimbursements of real estate taxes
  (real estate tax recovery) and common area maintenance expenses (CAM
  recovery). After removing the effect of properties purchased and sold during
  the past three years, real estate tax recovery has remained fairly constant,
  with the largest fluctuation


 
  being at Congressional Plaza.  Recovery was down in 1994 from 1993 as the
  center was vacated for renovation and recovery was up in 1995 compared to 1994
  as the center was leased following the renovation.  CAM recovery on the
  portfolio, adjusted to remove the effect of properties purchased in 1993, 1994
  and 1995, was $8.4 million in 1993, $11.7 million in 1994 and $10.0 million in
  1995.  These fluctuations correspond to fluctuations in CAM expenses,
  primarily snow removal, landscaping and security which were up in 1994 as
  compared to 1993, but which  decreased in 1995.

       Other property income includes items which tend to fluctuate from period
  to period, such as utility reimbursements, telephone income, merchant
  association dues, lease termination fees, late fees and temporary tenant
  income.  The increases from 1993 to 1995 were due in part to the acquisition
  of new properties and in part to the fluctuating nature of the income.  Major
  increases in 1995 over 1994 resulted from lease termination fees, an
  unexpected recovery from a  bankrupt tenant, merchant association dues and a
  commission on telephone services.
 
       Rental expenses went from $26.5 million in 1993 to $35.8 million in 1994
  to $35.1 million in 1995, which represents 23.8% of property income (rental
  income plus other property income) in 1993, 26.8% in 1994 and 23.3% in 1995.
  The components of rental expense with the greatest percentage increase in 1994
  were repairs and maintenance and ground rent. Snow removal expense, a
  component of repairs and maintenance, increased from $910,000 in 1993 to over
  $2.4 million in 1994 because of new properties and because of increased
  expense on the core portfolio resulting from the harsh weather conditions
  during 1994.  Ground rent increased $2.1 million in 1994 over 1993 because of
  the acquisition of Bethesda Row on December 31, 1993, a large part of which is
  ground leased.  In 1995 the greatest percentage changes were decreases in
  repairs and maintenance and in maintenance and security payroll costs.  Snow
  removal expense decreased to $1.3 million despite the acquisition of new
  properties and there has been a decrease in payroll costs as the Trust has
  taken measures to control these costs.  If rental expenses are adjusted to
  remove the effect of properties purchased in 1993, 1994 and 1995, rental
  expenses ranged from $24.9 million in 1993 to $27.2 million in 1994 to $24.5
  million in 1995.  Real estate taxes have ranged from 9.3% of rental income in
  1993 to 9.0% in 1994 to 9.6% in 1995.  The decline in 1994 was primarily due
  to Congressional Plaza, which received a refund of prior year taxes in 1994.

       Depreciation and amortization expenses have increased because of the
  recent acquisitions and also because of the depreciation on recent tenant work
  and property improvements.
 
       Interest income has remained relatively constant in each of the past
  three years. The Trust's major sources of interest income are on its mortgage
  notes receivable, its notes to officers, and its available cash balances.
  Included in interest income in 1995 is the effect of the sale in December 1995
  of the Trust's investment in Olympia and York Senior First Mortgage Notes and
  other real estate investment trusts, both of which were written down to market
  in prior years.


 
       Interest expense increased to $39.3 million in 1995 from $31.5 million in
  1994, primarily due to interest on the three issues of senior notes in 1995.
  Interest expense was relatively constant in 1994 and 1993, $31.5 million and
  $31.6 million, respectively.  Decreases in interest expense in 1994 from the
  repayment of several mortgages, an issue of senior notes and an issue of
  convertible subordinated debentures was offset by increases due to an issuance
  of convertible subordinated debentures, the interest portion of the capital
  lease at Bethesda Row and increased usage of the revolving credit facilities.
  The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.55x, 1.61X and 1.5X in 1995, 1994
  and 1993, respectively.  The ratio of funds from operations to fixed charges
  was 2.35x, 2.52x, and 2.27x in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
  
       While administrative expenses are increasing as the Trust grows and as it
  seeks  acquisition and development opportunities, administrative expenses as a
  percentage of total income have remained relatively constant, at 4.7%, 4.8%
  and 4.1%, in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The major components of the
  increase in 1995 over 1994 were in payroll and in costs related to a business
  combination that the Trust decided not to pursue.  The major component of the
  increase in 1994 over 1993 was an increase in costs connected with the review
  and analysis of potential property acquisitions which were not purchased.

       Other charges consisted of three nonrecurring items in 1994, a $758,000
  write off of a mortgage note receivable and accrued interest thereon, an
  unrealized loss of $449,000 on an investment in common shares of another real
  estate investment trust and a $152,000 recovery of a legal settlement paid in
  1987.  During 1995 the Trust sold its investments in common shares of other
  real estate investment trusts.

       Investors' share of operations represents the minority interest in
  Congressional Plaza, Loehmann's Plaza and North City Plaza.  In 1995 minority
  net losses at Loehmann's and North City exceeded the minority net income at
  Congressional Plaza.

       Income before loss on sale of real estate and extraordinary item
  increased from $16.1 million in 1993 to $20.5 million in 1994 to $23.7 million
  in 1995, reflecting increased revenues from the Trust's acquisitions and from
  improved operating results of the core portfolio.

       Loss or gain on the sale of real estate is dependent on the extent and
  timing of sales.  The Trust regularly reviews its portfolio and does from time
  to time sell properties.  In 1995 the Trust sold North City Plaza for $1.8
  million resulting in a loss on sale of $545,000.

       In 1993 the Trust had a net gain of $2.0 million on the early
  extinguishment of debt, resulting from a gain on the extinguishment of one
  mortgage offset by losses on the redemption of an issue of senior notes, an
  issue of convertible subordinated debentures and two other mortgages.

       As a result of the foregoing items, net income rose from $18.1 million in
  1993 to $20.5 million in 1994 to $23.1 million in 1995.


 
        The Trust intends to continue to acquire properties in 1996.  If
  successful in so doing, these acquisitions should contribute to growth in
  rental income and expenses and, thereby, net income.  The growth of the core
  portfolio, however, is, in part, dependent on controlling expenses, some of
  which are beyond the complete control of the Trust, such as snow removal, and
  trends in the retailing environment.  Recently there have been a number of
  retailer bankruptcies and others are anticipated.  These bankruptcies and a
  further weakening of the retail environment could adversely impact the Trust,
  by increasing vacancies and by decreasing rents.  In past weak retail and real
  estate environments, the Trust has been able to replace weak and bankrupt
  tenants with stronger tenants; management believes that the quality of the
  Trust's properties will continue to generate demand for its retail space.

  Impact of New Accounting Standards
  ----------------------------------

       In October 1995 the Financial Accounting Standards Board  (FASB) issued
  FASB 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation".   This standard will be
  effective for 1996 financial statements and requires that stock based
  compensation be accounted for on the fair value method described in FASB 123,
  or on the intrinsic value based method of APB 25, whereby if options are
  priced at fair market value or above on the date of grant, there is no
  compensation expense of the options to the Trust.  If APB 25 is used, proforma
  net income and earnings per share must be disclosed as if the fair value based
  method had been applied.  The Trust intends to continue accounting for its
  employee stock option plan under APB 25 and therefore the only effect on the
  Trust's financial statements will be the proforma disclosure.

  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
  CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

  Trustees and Shareholders
  Federal Realty Investment Trust

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Federal Realty
  Investment Trust as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
  consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
  for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These
  financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust's management.  Our
  responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
  our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
  material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
  also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
  estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
  statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
  for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
  all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Federal Realty
  Investment Trust as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the consolidated results
  of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for each of the three years
  in the period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted
  accounting principles.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       Federal Realty Investment Trust invests predominantly in income-producing
  real estate properties, primarily community and neighborhood shopping centers.
  Beginning in late 1994 the Trust expanded its investments to main street
  retail properties, retail buildings and shopping centers in densely developed
  urban and suburban areas.  The Trust's leases with tenants are classified as
  operating leases and rental income is recognized on an accrual basis over the
  terms of the related leases.

       The Trust uses the straight-line method in providing for depreciation.
  Estimated useful lives range from three to 25 years on apartment buildings and
  improvements, and from three to 35 years on retail properties and
  improvements.  Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as
  incurred.  Major improvements are capitalized.  The gain or loss resulting
  from the sale of  properties is included in net income at the time of sale.
  The Trust has adopted FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of".  The Trust does not hold
  any assets that meet the impairment criteria of FAS 121.

       The Trust capitalizes certain costs directly related to the acquisition,
  improvement and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and other
  related costs.  The capitalized costs associated with unsuccessful
  acquisitions are charged to operations when that determination is made.  The
  capitalized costs associated with improvements and leasing are depreciated or
  amortized over the life of the improvement and lease, respectively.

      Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are capitalized and are
  amortized as interest expense over the life of the related issue using the
  interest method.  Upon conversion or in the event of redemption, applicable
  unamortized costs are charged to shareholders' equity or to operations,
  respectively.

       The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
  estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code
  (the "Code").  Under those sections, a trust which distributes at least 95% of
  its real estate trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which
  meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its
  taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  Therefore, no
  provision for Federal income taxes is required.

       The Trust consolidates the financial statements of one wholly owned
  subsidiary, eight partnerships, and a joint venture which are controlled by
  the Trust. The equity interests of other investors are reflected as investors'
  interest in consolidated assets.  All significant intercompany transactions
  and balances are eliminated.

                                       F7

 
        The Trust defines cash as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial
  institutions and short term liquid investments with an initial maturity under
  three months.  Cash balances may exceed insurable amounts.

       Earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of
  shares outstanding during the respective periods, including options. Options
  are accounted for in accordance with APB 25, whereby if options are priced at
  fair market value or above at the date of grant, there is no compensation
  expense of the options to the Trust.

       Inherent in the preparation of the Trust's financial statements are
  certain estimates.  These estimates are prepared using management's best
  judgment, after considering past and current events.

       Certain previously reported amounts for 1994 and 1993 have been
  reclassified to assure comparability of all periods presented.  See Note 10.

  NOTE 1: REAL ESTATE AND ENCUMBRANCES

            A summary of the Trust's properties at December 31, 1995 is as
  follows:


       The Trust's 70 retail properties are located in 13 states and the
  District of Columbia, primarily along the East Coast between the Boston
  metropolitan area and Richmond, Virginia.  There are approximately 1,700
  tenants providing a wide range of retail products and services.  These tenants
  range from sole proprietorships to national retailers;  no one tenant or
  corporate group of tenants account for 5% or more of revenue.

       The Trust purchased 19 retail properties during 1995 for a total cost of
  $120.6 million.  The Trust also purchased a building abutting Flourtown
  Shopping Center, one of its existing centers, for $3.1 million.  Finley Square
  Shopping Center in suburban Chicago was purchased on April 27, 1995 for $18.8
  million in cash; Bristol Shopping Center in Bristol, Connecticut was purchased
  on September 22, 1995 for $19.6 million, by assuming a $11.3 million mortgage
  and by issuing 337,527 common shares valued at $7.3 million with the balance
  in cash; Park & Shop Center in Washington, D.C. was purchased on December 1,
  1995 for $11.2 million in cash; and on December 21, 1995 Shirlington Shopping
  Center in Arlington, Virginia was purchased for $23.5

                                       F8

 
  million in cash.  The retail building acquisitions during 1995 were as
  follows: seven buildings in West Hartford, Connecticut for $15.3 million; two
  buildings in Greenwich, Connecticut for $14.9 million; one building in
  Westport, Connecticut for $5.7 million; one building in Brookline,
  Massachusetts for $3.8 million; one building in Westfield, New Jersey for $2.2
  million; two buildings in Evanston, Illinois for $3.6 million and one
  building in an infill space at Bethesda Row, one of its existing properties in
  Bethesda, Maryland, for $2.0 million.  In connection with certain of these
  purchases, brokerage commissions of $671,000 were incurred to a company that
  is fifty percent owned by a brother of the Trust's president.  These
  commissions were paid pursuant to a brokerage contract on terms comparable to
  terms contained in contracts which the Trust has with brokers providing
  similar services in other geographic areas.

       On August 1, 1995 the Trust sold the 111,000 square foot North City
  Shopping Center in New Castle, Pennsylvania for $1.8 million, resulting in a
  loss of $545,000.

       The  Trust purchased four shopping centers in 1994.  Idylwood Plaza in
  Falls Church, Virginia was purchased for $14.3 million in cash; North Lake
  Commons in Lake Zurich, Illinois was purchased for $10.9 million in cash;
  Garden Market Shopping Center in Western Springs, Illinois was purchased for
  $7.6 million in cash; and Queen Anne Plaza in Norwell, Massachusetts was
  purchased for $10.7 million in cash and a $1.1 million note which was paid in
  January 1995.  In addition the Trust purchased a 3.9 acre parcel of land
  underlying a supermarket which adjoins its Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center
  for cash of $1.1 million and a retail building in Westport, Connecticut for
  cash of $3.8 million.

       During 1993 the Trust acquired seven shopping centers.  Pan Am Shopping
  Center in Fairfax, Virginia was acquired for $21.6 million in cash;
  Gaithersburg Square in Gaithersburg, Maryland was purchased for $11.0 million
  in cash and the assumption of a $2.0 million liability which is the estimated
  cost to remediate certain preexisting environmental issues;  Quince Orchard
  Plaza in Gaithersburg, Maryland and its adjoining office building were
  purchased for $10.9 million in cash and the assumption of a liability of
  approximately $250,000 to remediate preexisting environmental issues;
  Crossroads Shopping Center in Highland Park, Illinois was purchased for $16.2
  million in cash;  Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia,
  Pennsylvania was purchased for $17.0 million in cash;  Dedham Plaza in Dedham,
  Massachusetts was purchased for $25.0 million in cash and the assumption of a
  $250,000 liability to remediate existing environmental issues; and the
  leasehold interest in Bethesda Row in Bethesda, Maryland was acquired with
  $6.2 million in cash.

       Mortgage notes receivable consist of two notes in 1995 and 1994 and three
  notes in 1993 collateralized by shopping centers.  All three notes were issued
  in connection with either the acquisition or sale of Trust properties.  In
  1994 one note for $700,000 with accrued interest thereon was deemed
  uncollectible and therefore was written off.

                                      F-9

 
       In January 1994 a $22.5 million one year mortgage was placed on Northeast
  Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia.  The mortgage, which bore interest at LIBOR (London
  Interbank Offered Rate), plus 100 to 150 basis points was repaid in January
  1995.  In 1993 the Trust prepaid mortgages on Laurel, Northeast and Northeast
  Plaza shopping centers, resulting in a net gain of $2.9 million which was
  recorded as a component of the net gain on early extinguishment of debt.

       In November 1994 the Trust exercised an option to purchase the ground
  underlying the Northeast Shopping Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for
  $4.2 million, $3.4 million of which had been recorded as a capital lease
  obligation.

       Mortgages payable and capital lease obligations are due in installments
  over various terms extending to 2060 with actual or imputed interest rates
  ranging from 7.9% to 11.25%.  Certain of the mortgage and capital lease
  obligations require additional interest payments based upon property
  performance.

       Aggregate mortgage principal payments due during the next five years are
  $1.3 million,  $1.4 million, $54.5 million, $532,000, and $583,000,
  respectively.

       Future minimum lease payments and their present value for property under
  capital leases as of December 31, 1995 are as follows:

  Leasing Arrangements
  --------------------

       The Trust's leases with retail property and apartment tenants are
  classified as operating leases.  Leases on apartments are generally for a
  period of one year, whereas retail property leases generally range from three
  to 10 years and usually provide for contingent rentals based on sales and
  sharing of certain operating costs.

                                      F10

 
            The components of rental income are as follows:                 

       Minimum future retail property rentals on noncancelable operating leases
  as of December 31, 1995 are as follows:
   
  NOTE 2. INVESTMENTS

       At December 31, 1994 the Trust's investments of $3.6 million consisted of
  $4.7 million of Olympia and York Senior First Mortgage Notes due March 20,
  1999, which were carried at $3.1 million and $500,000 of marketable equity
  securities and mutual funds which were stated at market.  In 1994 the Trust
  recognized an unrealized loss of $449,000 on these equity securities. In 1995
  the Trust sold the equity securities realizing an additional loss of $54,000.
  The Olympia and York Senior Notes were also sold in 1995, at a gain of
  $200,000 over their recorded value.  At December 31, 1995 investments
  consisted of mutual funds stated at market.

  NOTE 3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
  -------------------------------------------

       The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by the
  Trust, using available market information and

                                      F11

 
  appropriate valuation methods.  Considerable judgment is necessary to develop
  estimates of fair value.  The estimates presented herein are not necessarily
  indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the
  financial instruments.

       The Trust estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using the
  following methods and assumptions: (1) quoted market prices, when available,
  are used to estimate the fair value of investments in marketable debt and
  equity securities; (2) quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair
  value of the Trust's marketable convertible subordinated debentures; (3)
  discounted cash flow analyses are used to estimate the fair value of long term
  notes receivable and payable, using the Trust's estimate of current interest
  rates for similar notes; (4) carrying amounts in the balance sheet approximate
  fair value for cash and short term borrowings.  Notes receivable from officers
  are excluded from fair value estimation since they have been issued in
  connection with employee stock ownership programs.

 
  NOTE 4. NOTES PAYABLE
  ---------------------

       At December 31, 1995 and 1994 the Trust had notes payable of $50.0
  million and $61.9 million, respectively.  Of these balances, $40.1 million in
  1995 and $54.7 million in 1994 were issued under the Trust's revolving credit
  facilities.

       The remaining balance of notes payable was issued in connection with the
  acquisition, leasing or renovation of properties.  A $2.5 million noninterest
  bearing note which is due on or before December 16, 1996, was issued in
  September 1995 in connection with a lease transaction at Barracks Road. A
  note, with a balance of $1.4 million at December 31, 1995, was issued in
  connection with the buyout of a tenant at Queen Anne Plaza in January 1995.
  The noninterest bearing note of $2.2 million, due in annual installments of
  $200,000 for 11 years was recorded at its discounted value using an interest
  rate of 8 7/8%.

       In December 1994 the Trust issued a one month note payable January 1995
  for $1.1 million in connection with the purchase of Queen Anne Plaza.  A 10%
  note, payable in equal monthly installments with a final maturity in 2013,
  issued in connection

                                      F-12

 
  with the renovation of Perring Plaza had a balance of $2.9 million in 1995 and
  $3.0 million in 1994.  A note issued in connection with the acquisition of
  Federal Plaza, bearing interest at 11% and maturing in 1996, with a balance of
  $2.9 million in 1994 and $3.0 million in 1995 comprises the majority of the
  balance of the notes payable.

       At December 31, 1995 and 1994 the Trust had $130 million of unsecured
  medium term revolving credit facilities with four banks.  The facilities,
  which bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 to 100 basis points at December 31, 1995,
  at LIBOR plus 85 to 100 basis points prior to December 1995, require fees and
  have covenants requiring a minimum shareholders' equity and a maximum ratio of
  debt to net worth.  The maximum drawn under these facilities during 1995 and
  1994 was $66.8 million and $54.7 million, respectively.  In 1995 and 1994 the
  weighted average interest rate on borrowings  was 6.9% and 5.6%, respectively,
  and the average amount outstanding was $26.7 million and $26.3 million,
  respectively.


  NOTE 5. DIVIDENDS
  -----------------

      On November 27, 1995 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of
  $.41 per share, payable January 12, 1996 to shareholders of record January 2,
  1996.  For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, $.43, $.75 and
  $.45 of dividends paid per share, respectively, represented a return of
  capital.

  NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
  -------------------------------------

       Pursuant to the provisions of the Loehmann's Plaza Limited Partnership
  Agreement, on or after September 1, 1995 the limited partner may require the
  Trust to purchase his interest in the Partnership at its then fair market
  value.

       The Congressional Plaza Shopping Center Joint Venture Agreement provides
  that upon six months advance notice the Trust can be required to purchase its
  pro rata share of one venturer's 22.5% or greater joint venture interest for a
  purchase price based on the appraised fair market value of the shopping
  center, but no less than the percentage of joint venture interest being sold
  multiplied by the difference between $17.5 million and the remaining principal
  balance of any liabilities of the Joint Venture.

       The State of New Jersey Division of Taxation assessed the Trust $364,000
  in taxes, penalty and interest for the years 1985 through 1990, since the
  State disallowed the dividends paid deduction in computing New Jersey taxable
  income.  The Trust  protested this assessment since the Trust believed that it
  was entitled to the deduction.  The case was dismissed in December 1995 in
  favor of the Trust.

       As previously reported,certain of the Trust's shopping centers have some
  environmental contamination.  The North Carolina Department of the
  Environment, Health and Natural

                                      F13

 
  Resources ("DEHNR") issued a Notice of Violation ("NOV") against a former dry
  cleaner tenant at Eastgate Shopping Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina
  concerning a spill at the shopping center.  As owner of the shopping center,
  the Trust was named in and received a copy of the NOV.  Estimates to remediate
  the spill range from $300,000 to $500,000.  The Trust has entered into an
  agreement with two previous owners of the shopping center to share the costs
  to assess and remediate.  In 1993 the Trust recorded a liability of $120,000
  as its estimated share of the cleanup costs.

       In 1992 contaminants at levels in excess of New Jersey cleanup standards
  were identified at a shopping center in New Jersey.  The Trust has retained an
  environmental consultant to investigate the contamination.  The Trust is also
  evaluating whether it has insurance coverage for this matter.  At this time,
  the Trust has not determined what the range of remediation costs might be, but
  does not believe that the costs will have a material effect upon the Trust's
  financial condition.  The Trust has also identified chlorinated solvent
  contamination at another property. The contamination appears to be linked to
  the current and/or previous dry cleaner.  The Trust intends to look to the
  responsible parties for any remediation effort.  Evaluation of this situation
  is preliminary and it is impossible, at this time, to estimate the range of
  remediation costs, if any.

       On September 22, 1995 the Trust purchased the Bristol Shopping Center in
  Bristol, Connecticut.  Pursuant to an agreement executed at closing, the Trust
  agreed to perform all remedial measures necessary to obtain a final letter of
  compliance from the Connecticut Commissioner of Environmental Protection with
  respect to certain identified soil and ground water contamination associated
  with a former dry cleaning operation.  The seller established an escrow
  account at closing of $187,500 to cover such remedial measures and has
  indemnified the Trust in connection with the identified contamination.

       The Trust reserved $2.25 million at closing in 1993 for environmental
  issues, principally associated with Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center.
  Pursuant to an indemnity agreement entered into with the seller at closing,
  the Trust agreed to take certain actions with respect to identified
  chlorinated solvent contamination.  The seller indemnified the Trust for
  certain third party claims and government requirements related to
  contamination at adjacent properties.  During the third quarter of 1995 the
  reserve was reduced by $269,000 with a corresponding reduction in the basis of
  land at one shopping center since the environmental issue there was resolved.

       A nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Trust officers was
  established in 1994.  The plan allows the officers to defer future income
  until the earlier of age 65 or termination of employment with the Trust.  As
  of December 31, 1995, the Trust is liable to participants for approximately
  $261,000 under this plan.  Although this is an unfunded plan, the Trust has
  purchased certain investments with which to match this obligation.

                                      F-14

 
       The Trust has entered into agreements with certain key employees whereby
  if these employees voluntarily or involuntarily leave the employment of the
  Trust within six months after a "change of control" (defined as control of 35%
  or more of outstanding shares) of the Trust, they will be entitled to a lump
  sum cash payment equal to one to three times their annual salary as of the
  date of termination and have their health and welfare benefits and executive
  privileges continued for a period of one to three years.  In the event of a
  change of control, the Trust also agreed that all restrictions on the exercise
  or receipt of any stock options and stock grants shall lapse upon termination
  of employment and that all shares owned at termination shall be redeemed by
  the Trust at a formula price.

       The Trust had previously entered into employment agreements with its
  President and certain other key employees for terms of up to three years,
  which automatically renewed at the end of each month unless either party
  notified the other that it elected not to extend the term.  During 1994 the
  Trust offered certain of the employees covered under these agreements, other
  than the President, a severance agreement in lieu of the employment agreement.
  Two employees retained their employment agreements, which agreements now have
  a fixed declining term. The severance agreement prescribes that, among other
  things, if the employee is terminated without cause, he/she is entitled to
  salary for up to 18 months and benefits for up to nine months.

       As of December 31, 1995 in connection with the renovation of certain
  shopping centers, the Trust has contractual obligations of $7.4 million.  In
  addition the Trust is contractually obligated under leases to provide up to
  $6.0 million in building and tenant improvements.

  The Trust is obligated under ground lease agreements on several shopping
  centers requiring minimum annual payments as follows:
 

  NOTE 7. 5 1/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES
  ---------------------------------------------------

       In October 1993 the Trust issued $75.0 million of 5 1/4% convertible
  subordinated debentures, realizing cash proceeds of approximately $73.0
  million.  The debentures were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
  and were not publicly distributed within the United States.  The debentures,
  which mature in 2003, are convertible into shares of beneficial interest at
  $36 per share.  The debentures are redeemable by the Trust, in whole, at any
  time after October 28, 1998 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
  interest.

      At December 1995 and 1994 the Trust had outstanding $289,000 of 5 1/4%
  convertible subordinated debentures due 2002.  The

                                      F15

 
  debentures which are convertible into shares of beneficial interest at $30.625
  were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were not publicly
  distributed within the United States.

       In April 1994, $39.8 million of the debentures were redeemed at a price
  equal to 120% of their principal amount or $47.8 million, in accordance with a
  premium put.  A principal amount of $53,000 of these debentures was converted
  into 1,729 shares in 1994.  During 1993 the Trust purchased $3.7 million of
  these debentures, resulting in a loss of $74,000 which was recorded as a
  component of the net gain on early extinguishment of debt.

  NOTE 8. SENIOR NOTES
  --------------------

       On January 19, 1995 the Trust issued $100.0 million of 8 7/8% Notes, due
  January 15, 2000.  The notes, which were issued at a price of 99.815%, pay
  interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15 and are not redeemable prior
  to maturity.  After deducting the underwriting discount and other costs, the
  Trust netted approximately $98.9 million.

       In order to protect itself against the risk that the general level of
  interest rates for such securities would rise before the senior notes were
  priced, in December 1994, the Trust entered into two interest rate hedge
  agreements on a total principal amount of $75.0 million.  The cost of the
  agreements, which terminated on January 20, 1995, was $21,000, which is being
  amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes.

       In January 1995 the Trust executed a five year interest rate swap on
  $25.0 million, whereby the Trust swapped fixed interest payment obligations of
  8.1% for a floating rate interest payment of three month LIBOR.  The floating
  rate during the first quarter of 1995 was 6.2%.  In May 1995 the swap was
  terminated and the Trust sold the swap for $1.5 million, which is being
  amortized as a deduction to interest expense over the remaining term.

       On April 21, 1995 the Trust issued $25.0 million of senior notes, netting
  $24.9 million after deducting discounts and costs.  The notes, which are due
  April 21, 2002 and bear interest at 8%, payable semiannually on April 21 and
  October 21, were issued at a price of 99.683%.

       On December 8, 1995 the Trust issued an additional $40.0 million of
  senior notes, netting $39.6 million after deducting costs.  The notes, which
  mature on December 1, 2005 and bear interest at 6 5/8%, payable June 1 and
  December 1, were  issued at a price of 99.3%.

  NOTE 9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
  ----------------------------

       In September 1995 the Trust issued 337,527 shares of beneficial interest
  valued at $7.3 million in partial consideration for the purchase of Bristol
  Shopping Center.

       In April 1994 the Trust raised net proceeds of $61.3 million from a
  public offering of 2.5 million shares of beneficial

                                      F16

 
  interest ("shares").  In a concurrent offering of 840,000 shares to an
  institutional investor, the Trust raised net proceeds of $21.7 million.  In
  April 1993 the Trust sold 2.8 million shares in a public offering, raising net
  proceeds of $72.8 million.  In December 1993 the Trust sold 220,000 shares for
  $5.4 million in a private placement in connection with the long term lease of
  a property.

       The Trust has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, whereby shareholders may use
  their dividends to purchase shares.  In November 1995 and March 1993, the
  Trust registered an additional 1.0 million shares and 500,000 shares,
  respectively, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with
  the plan.  In 1995, 1994, and 1993, 193,965 shares, 162,466 shares and 131,620
  shares, respectively, were issued under the Plan.

       On January 1, 1994 under the terms of the 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan,
  an officer of the Trust purchased 40,000 common shares at $25 per share with
  the assistance of a $1.0 million loan from the Trust.  The loan, which has a
  term of 12 years, bears interest at 6.24%.  Forgiveness of up to 75% of the
  loan is subject to the future performance of the Trust.  One eighth of the
  loan was forgiven on January 31, 1995; another one sixteenth was forgiven on
  January 31, 1996 as certain performance criteria of the Trust were met.

       In January 1991 the Trustees adopted the Federal Realty Investment Trust
  Share Purchase Plan.  Under the terms of this plan, officers and certain
  employees of the Trust purchased 446,000 common shares at $15.125 per share
  with the assistance of loans of $6.7 million from the Trust.  Originally, the
  Plan called for one sixteenth of the loan to be forgiven each year for eight
  years, as long as the participant was still employed by the Trust.  The loans
  for all participants, but two, were modified in 1994 to extend the term an
  additional four years and to tie forgiveness in 1995 and thereafter to certain
  performance criteria of the Trust.  One sixteenth of the loan was forgiven in
  1995.  The Trust has loaned participants $839,000 to pay the taxes due in
  connection with the plan.  The purchase loans and the tax loans bear interest
  at 9.39%.  The shares purchased under the plan may not be sold, pledged or
  assigned until both the purchase and tax loans are satisfied and the term has
  expired.

       Under the terms of the 1988 Share Bonus Plan, 108,000 shares were granted
  to officers and key employees. During the year ended December 31, 1993, the
  last 4,000 shares were vested and charged to operations. In connection with
  these shares, the Trust has made loans to the participants to pay the taxes
  due in connection with the plan. The notes bear interest at the lesser of 
  (i) the Trust's borrowing rate or (ii) the Trust's current indicated annual 
  dividend rate divided by the purchase price of such shares. Notes issued under
  this plan are being forgiven over three years from issuance if the officer is
  still employed by the Trust. During the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994
  and 1993, $49,000, $74,000 and $80,000, respectively, was forgiven. The tax
  loans under this plan and the share purchase plan are recorded as notes
  receivable-officers.
                                      
                                      F17

 
       In connection with a restricted share grant, the Trust accepted from the
  President a noninterest bearing note for $210,000.  One installment of
  $105,000 was paid on the note in 1992 and the second installment is due April
  15, 2001.

  In 1987 the Trust purchased approximately $887,000 worth of shares of other
  real estate investment trusts ("REITs") as a long term investment.   In 1994
  the Trust recognized an unrealized loss of $449,000 on these shares, since
  the decline in value of one investment appeared to be permanent.  Due to
  temporary price declines in the other REITs, the Trust had an allowance for
  unrealized losses of $53,000 as of December 31, 1994.  The Trust sold these
  shares in 1995, recognizing an additional loss of $54,000.

       At December 31, 1995, the Trust had 61,328 shares in treasury at a cost
  of $1.2 million .  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Trust had 60,200 shares
  in treasury at a cost of $1.1 million.

       On April 13, 1989, the Trustees adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (the
  Plan).  Under the Plan, one right was issued for each outstanding share of
  common stock held as of April 24, 1989, and a right will be attached to each
  share issued in the future.  The rights are exercisable into common shares
  upon the occurrence of certain events, including acquisition by a person or
  group of certain levels of beneficial ownership or a tender offer by such a
  person or group. The rights are redeemable by the Trust for $.01 and expire on
  April 24, 1999.

  NOTE 10. STOCK OPTION PLAN
  --------------------------

       The 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan ("Plan") was approved by shareholders
  in May 1993.  On the date of approval, 472,500 options were awarded to
  officers, employees and nonemployee Trustees.  On December 16, 1993, 69,000
  options were awarded to employees.  Under the Plan, on each annual meeting
  date during the term of the plan, each nonemployee Trustee will be awarded
  2,500 options.  Accordingly on each of May 10, 1995 and May 4, 1994,  20,000
  options were awarded to nonemployee Trustees.  On February 15, 1995,
  719,000 stock options at $20.75 per share were granted to employees of the
  Trust.
 
       The option price to acquire shares under the 1993 Plan and previous plans
  is required to be at least the fair market value at the date of grant.  As a
  result of the exercise of options, the Trust has outstanding from its officers
  and employees notes for $1.9 million.  The notes issued under the 1993 plan
  bear interest at the dividend rate on the date of exercise divided by the
  purchase price of such shares.  The notes issued under the previous plans bear
  interest at the lesser of (i) the Trust's borrowing rate or (ii) the current
  indicated annual dividend rate on the shares acquired pursuant to the option,
  divided by the purchase price of such shares.  The notes are collateralized by
  the shares and are with recourse.  In September 1995 the terms of the option
  loans were modified.  The loans, which previously had a five year term, may
  now have a term extending to the employee's or officer's retirement date.
  Consequently these loans are now

                                      F18

 
  being classified as subscriptions receivable, a component of stockholder's
  equity, rather than as notes receivable-officers.  The 1994 and 1993 balances
  of notes receivable-officers and subscriptions receivable have been
  reclassified to allow comparability.
 

  NOTE 11. SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN
  ------------------------------------

       The Trust has a savings and retirement plan in accordance with the
  provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the plan,
  the Trust, out of its current net income, contributed 50% of each employee's
  contribution.  Employees' contributions range, at the discretion of each
  employee, from 1% to 5% of compensation.  In addition, the Trust may make
  discretionary contributions within the limits of deductibility set forth by
  the Code.  Employees of the Trust, who work over 1,000 hours annually, are
  eligible to become plan participants.  The Trust's expense for the years ended
  December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $158,000, $147,000 and $133,000,
  respectively.  In 1995 the Trust recorded a liability for an additional
  contribution of 1% of salary for all nonofficer employees who are eligible for
  the 401(k) plan; this is in addition to another 1% of salary which will be
  paid to all eligible nonofficer employees as a bonus for 1995.

       The plan was amended in December 1995 so that effective January 1, 1996
  nonofficer participants may defer compensation to the maximum levels
  allowable, currently the lesser of $9,500 or 17% of income.  The Trust will
  continue to contribute 50% of the deferral up to 5% of compensation.


  NOTE 12. INTEREST EXPENSE
  -------------------------

       The Trust incurred interest expense totaling $40.2 million, $31.8 million
  and $31.8 million, in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, of which $975,000,
  $348,000 and $216,000,

                                      F19

 
  respectively, was capitalized.  Interest paid was $33.4 million in 1995, $39.9
  million in 1994 which included $8.0 million of the premium on the 5 1/4%
  convertible subordinated debentures which were redeemed in April 1994, and
  $31.4 million in 1993.

  NOTE 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
  --------------------------

       On February 16, 1996, 58,681 options at $21.125 were issued to employees
  of the Trust.

       On February 28, 1996 the Trust purchased two buildings in Winter Park,
  Florida for a combined purchase price of $6.7 million.
