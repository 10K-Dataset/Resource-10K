PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

References to “we,” “us,” “our” or the
“Trust” refer to Federal Realty Investment Trust and our business and operations conducted through our directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries.

General

We are an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in the ownership, management, development and
redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, as well
as in California. As of December 31, 2007, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 82 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately
18.2 million square feet. In total, these 82 real estate projects were 96.7% leased at December 31, 2007. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 1.0 million square
feet as of December 31, 2007. In total, the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 98.3% leased at December 31, 2007. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have
increased our dividends per common share for 40 consecutive years. Revenue, property operating income, and other financial information of each reportable segment are described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and in the financial statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.

We were founded in 1962 as a real estate investment trust under the laws of the District of Columbia and re-formed as a real estate investment trust in the state of Maryland in 1999. Our principal executive offices
are located at 1626 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852 and our telephone number is (301) 998-8100. Our Web site address is

www.federalrealty.com

. The information contained on our Web site is not a part of this report.

Business Objectives and Strategies

Our primary
business objective is to own, manage, acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail properties, with the dominant property type being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers, that will:

•

generate higher internal growth than our peers;

•

protect investor capital;

•

provide increasing cash flow for distributions to shareholders; and

•

provide potential for capital appreciation.

Our
traditional focus has been and remains on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers. Late in 1994, recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance of retailer expansion to main streets, we expanded our investment strategy to
include “street retail” and “mixed-use” properties. The mixed-use properties are typically centered around a retail component but also include office, residential and/or hotel components.



Operating Strategies

Our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker, underperforming tenants with
stronger ones. Our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country. In addition, because of the in-fill nature of our locations, our properties generally face less competition per capita than
properties owned by our peers. These strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales, which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates, charge higher rental rates, and maintain steady rent growth, all of which increase the value of
our portfolio. Our operating strategies also include:

•

increasing rental rates through the renewal of expiring leases or the leasing of space to new tenants at higher rental rates while limiting vacancy and down-time;

•

maintaining a diversified tenant base, thereby limiting exposure to any one tenant’s financial difficulties;

•

monitoring the merchandising mix of our tenant base to achieve a balance of strong national and regional tenants with local specialty tenants;

•

minimizing overhead and operating costs;

•

monitoring the physical appearance of our properties and the construction quality, condition and design of the buildings and other improvements located on our
properties to maximize our ability to attract customers and thereby generate higher rents and occupancy rates;

•

developing local and regional market expertise in order to capitalize on market and retailing trends;

•

leveraging the contacts and experience of our management team to build and maintain long-term relationships with tenants, investors and financing sources; and

•

providing exceptional customer service.

Investing Strategies

Our investment strategy is to deploy capital at risk-adjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of
capital in projects that have potential for future income growth.

Our investments primarily fall into one of the following five
categories:

•

renovating, expanding, reconfiguring and/or retenanting our existing properties to take advantage of under-utilized land or existing square footage to increase
revenue;

•

acquiring community and neighborhood shopping centers, located in densely populated or affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high, and
that have possibilities for enhancing operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and/or retenanting;

•

renovating or expanding tenant spaces for tenants capable of producing higher sales, and therefore, paying higher rents, including expanding space available to an
existing tenant that is performing well but is operating out of an old or otherwise inefficient store format;

•

developing the retail portions of mixed-use properties and developing other portions of mixed-use properties we already own; and

•

acquiring, in partnership with longer term investors who contribute a substantial portion of the equity needed to acquire those properties, stabilized community and
neighborhood shopping centers, located in densely populated or affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high.



Investment Criteria

When we evaluate potential redevelopment, retenanting, expansion and acquisition opportunities, we consider such factors as:

•

the expected returns in relation to our cost of capital as well as the anticipated risk we will face in achieving the expected returns;

•

the anticipated growth rate of operating income generated by the property;

•

the tenant mix at the property, tenant sales performance and the creditworthiness of those tenants;

•

the geographic area in which the property is located, including the population density and household incomes, as well as the population and income trends in that
geographic area;

•

competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property, including competition for tenants and the ability to create competing properties through redevelopment, new
construction or renovation;

•

access to and visibility of the property from existing roadways and the potential for new, widened or realigned, roadways within the property’s trade area,
which may affect access and commuting and shopping patterns;

•

the level and success of our existing investments in the market area;

•

the current market value of the land, buildings and other improvements and the potential for increasing those market values; and

•

the physical condition of the land, buildings and other improvements, including the structural and environmental condition.

Financing Strategies

Our financing strategy is designed to enable us
to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most cost-efficient way possible. Our financing strategy includes:

•

maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an appropriate pool of unencumbered properties that is sufficient to support our unsecured borrowings;

•

managing our exposure to variable-rate debt;

•

taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt, reduce interest costs and manage our debt maturity schedule so that a significant portion of
our debt does not mature in any one year;

•

selling properties that have limited growth potential or are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio and redeploying the proceeds to redevelop, renovate,
retenant and/or expand our existing properties, acquire new properties or reduce debt; and

•

utilizing the most advantageous long-term source of capital available to us to finance redevelopment and acquisition opportunities, which may include:

•

the sale of our equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements,

•

the incurrence of indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings,

•

the issuance of operating units in a new or existing “downREIT partnership” that is controlled and consolidated by us (generally operating units in a
“downREIT” partnership are issued in exchange for a tax deferred contribution of property; these units receive the same distributions as our common shares and the holders of these units have the right to exchange their units for cash or
the same number of our common shares, at our option), or

•

the use of joint venture arrangements.



Employees

At
February 22, 2008, we had 301 full-time employees and 155 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

Tax Status

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust
for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1962. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on REIT taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders. Under the internal revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income each year. We will be subject
to federal income tax on our taxable income (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of REIT
taxable income. We will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we
may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed REIT taxable income.

We
have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, which we refer to as a TRS. In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the
Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. The sales of condominiums at Santana Row, which occurred between August 2005 and August 2006, and the sales of Bath Shopping Center, Key Road Plaza and Riverside Plaza in 2007 were conducted
through a TRS. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, our TRS incurred approximately $1.5 million, $2.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of income taxes.

Governmental Regulations Affecting Our Properties

We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental,
health, safety and similar laws, including:

•

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA;

•

the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act;

•

the Federal Clean Water Act;

•

the Federal Clean Air Act;

•

the Toxic Substances Control Act;

•

the Occupational Safety & Health Act; and

•

the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The
application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the current and former uses of the property, the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the
property. Under certain environmental laws, principally CERCLA, we, as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned, may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances, asbestos-containing
materials, or petroleum product releases at the property. We may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination, whether or not
we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. As the owner or
operator of real estate, we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate. Such costs or liabilities



could exceed the value of the affected real estate. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability
to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.

Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the
costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe they will in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur,
any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire
in the future. We have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of
our properties.

Competition

Numerous commercial
developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties. Some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do, although we do not believe that any single competitor or
group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market. This competition may:

•

reduce the number of properties available for acquisition;

•

increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;

•

interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents, and

•

adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.

Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, superstores, and other forms of marketing of goods and services, such as direct mail, electronic commerce and
telemarketing. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Also, documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, including documents that we subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the SEC, will contain forward-looking statements. When we refer to forward-looking statements or information,
sometimes we use words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “plans,” “intends,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates” and
“continues.” In particular, the below risk factors describe forward-looking information. The risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. Many
things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. These factors include, but are not limited to the following:

Revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful.

Revenue from our
properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis. Some of our leases provide for the payment, in addition to base rent, of additional rent above the
base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property. General economic downturns and other conditions affecting the retail
industry may affect the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants. Any reduction in our tenants’ ability to pay base rent, percentage rent or other
charges, including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants.

Our net income could be adversely affected
in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of any anchor store or anchor tenant. Anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and
contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property. The closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by, or reductions in
rent from, other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result. This could reduce our net income.

We may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.

We derive most of our revenue directly
or indirectly from rent received from our tenants. We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, whether by their terms, as a result of a tenant bankruptcy or otherwise, leases for space in our properties may not be
renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms. As a result, our results of operations and our net income
could be reduced.

The amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $1.6 billion of debt outstanding. Of that outstanding debt, approximately $349.4 million was secured
by 18 of our properties and approximately $76.1 million represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties. In addition, we own a 30% interest in a joint venture that had $81.5 million of debt secured by six properties as of
December 31, 2007. Approximately $1.4 billion (87%) of our debt as of December 31, 2007, which includes all of our property secured debt and our capital lease obligations, is fixed rate debt. Our joint venture’s debt of $81.5
million is also fixed rate debt. Our organizational



documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur. We do not have a policy limiting the ratio of our debt to total capitalization or
assets. The amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders. For example, it could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, property
acquisitions, redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future;

•

limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares;

•

make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements;

•

require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on fixed rate debt upon refinancing or on our variable rate, unhedged debt, if
interest rates rise;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business;

•

limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital, debt refinancing, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, redevelopment or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms; and

•

limit our flexibility in conducting our business, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms.

Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily
on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in
the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs. If we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our
debt obligations and other cash needs, including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust. We cannot assure you that any such refinancing, sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on
terms that we would find acceptable.

We are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt that could restrict our operating
activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt.

Our credit facility and term
loans include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. We are also required to comply with additional covenants that include, among other things, provisions:

•

relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage;

•

restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;

•

restricting our ability to incur additional debt;

•

restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage;

•

restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and

•

restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants. If we were to breach any of our debt covenants, including the covenants listed
above, and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan.
Many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and
fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations. As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the
market value of our shares.



Our development activities have inherent risks.

The ground-up development of improvements on real property, as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements, presents substantial risks. We generally do not intend to undertake on our own
construction of any new large-scale mixed-use, ground-up development projects; however, we do intend to complete the development and construction of remaining phases of projects we already have started, such as Bethesda Row in Bethesda, Maryland,
Santana Row in San Jose, California, and Assembly Square in Somerville, Massachusetts. We may undertake development of these and other projects if it is justifiable on a risk-adjusted return basis. If additional phases of any of our existing
projects or if any new projects are not successful, it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to the risks
associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere, the risks associated with our remaining development activities include:

•

significant time lag between commencement and completion subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy;

•

failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms;

•

expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed;

•

inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of lease-up;

•

higher than estimated construction costs, including labor and material costs; and

•

possible delay in completion of a project because of a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning
or other regulatory approvals, or acts of God (such as fires, earthquakes or floods).

Redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to
perform as expected.

Our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of community and neighborhood shopping centers in densely
populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply. The redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following, any of which could adversely affect our
results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:

•

our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning
or redevelopment may be too short. As a result, the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer time;

•

we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify;

•

we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully;

•

properties we redevelop or acquire may, within the time frames we project, fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project at the time we make the decision
to invest, which may result in the properties’ failure to achieve the returns we projected;

•

our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the
property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs; and

•

our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail
to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost.



Our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital.

Our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties. We believe that it will be difficult to
fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because, in addition to other requirements, we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a real
estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. The debt could include mortgage
loans from third parties or the sale of debt securities. Equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares. We cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on
favorable terms. Our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the market’s perception of our growth potential, our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. Depending on the
outcome of these factors, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy.

Rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares.

Of our approximately $1.6 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2007, approximately $209.4 million bears interest at variable rates and was unhedged. We may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the
future. Increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount
we are able to distribute to our shareholders. Although we have in the past and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions as to a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates, the
amounts we are required to pay under the variable rate debt to which the hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements. In addition, an increase in market
interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost of refinancing or
issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares.

Our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate
industry.

Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and, consequently, the value of our investments, are subject to the risk
that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. As a real
estate company, we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks:

•

economic downturns in general, or in the areas where our properties are located;

•

adverse changes in local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or reduction in demand;

•

changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;

•

zoning or regulatory restrictions;

•

decreases in market rental rates;

•

weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;

•

costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; and

•

increases in the cost of adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, associated with one or more properties, which may
occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties, although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues.



Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from our properties decreases.

Our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real
estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. As a result, cash flow from the
operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms. Under those circumstances, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur
substantial legal costs. Additionally, new properties that we may acquire or develop may not produce any significant revenue immediately, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service
associated with such new properties until they are fully leased.

Competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient
income from tenants.

Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and
properties for acquisition. This competition may:

•

reduce properties available for acquisition;

•

increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;

•

reduce rents payable to us;

•

interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;

•

lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and

•

adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.

Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, and other forms of marketing of goods, such as direct mail, internet marketing and telemarketing. This
competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants. If we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties, or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets, it could materially affect our
ability to generate net income, service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders.

We may be unable to sell properties when appropriate
because real estate investments are illiquid.

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In addition, there are some limitations under
federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to REITs in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets. We may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Our inability to
respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.

Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.

We currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our
properties, including insurance for liability, fire, flood, rental loss and acts of terrorism. We also currently carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties in California and environmental insurance on most of our properties. All of these
policies contain coverage limitations. We believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located. We intend to
obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties.

The availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance
may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry. As a result, we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices. In addition, insurance companies
may no



longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold, or, if offered, the expense of obtaining these
types of insurance may not be justified. We therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured
limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the
property. We cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. If any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt seriously our operations, delay revenue and result in
large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Also, due to inflation, changes in codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been
damaged or destroyed. Events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations, including distributions to our shareholders.

We may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments.

Our organizational documents do not
limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets jointly with other persons or entities and as of February 22, 2008, excluding our joint venture with Clarion Lion Properties Fund, we hold ten predominantly retail real
estate projects jointly with other persons. We may make additional joint investments in the future. Our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks, including the possibility that our partners or co-investors might become
bankrupt, that those partners or co-investors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals, and that those partners or co-investors might be in a position to take
action contrary to our suggestions or instructions, or in opposition to our policies or objectives. Although we hold the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing co-investments as of February 22, 2008, we must
obtain the consent of the co-investor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance three of these properties. Joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely
affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. We may also be liable for the actions of our co-investors.

In addition, on July 1,
2004, we entered into a joint venture with affiliates of Clarion Lion Properties Fund for purposes of acquiring properties. Although we are the managing general partner of that entity, we have only a 30% ownership interest in that entity. Our
partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture, and as a result, we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the
property or the property’s income stream. Pursuant to the terms of our partnership, we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following:

•

enter into new anchor tenant leases, modify existing anchor tenant leases or enforce remedies against anchor tenants;

•

make certain repairs, renovations or other changes or improvements to properties; and

•

sell or finance the property with secured debt.

The
terms of our partnership require that certain acquisition opportunities be presented first to the joint venture, which limits our ability to acquire properties for our own account which could, in turn, limit our ability to grow. Our investment in
this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments. As of December 31, 2007, this joint venture owned seven properties.

Environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties.

All real property and
the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials, environmental protection and human health and safety. Under various federal, state and local laws,
ordinances and regulations, we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or



operate, and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. This liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or
our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release. The presence of contamination or the failure properly to remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell
or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral. The costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. We are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties
that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations taken as a whole. The uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the
property are among the property-specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties. If we are subject to any material environmental liabilities, the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations
and our ability to meet our obligations.

We cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing
or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future. Compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend
funds to remedy environmental problems. Our tenants, like many of their competitors, have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations, which will
adversely affect their potential profitability.

Generally, our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements. Our leases
typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant. If a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or
cannot comply, we could be forced to pay these costs. If not addressed, environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or re-lease the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments.

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties.

Our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990. Investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with this Act. The requirements of this Act, or of other federal, state or local laws, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to
access for disabled persons. Future compliance with this Act may require expensive changes to the properties.

The revenues generated by our tenants
could be negatively affected by various federal, state and local laws to which they are subject.

We and our tenants are subject to a wide range of
federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws and state and local fire, life-safety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties. The leases typically require that
each tenant comply with all regulations. Failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties. Non-compliance of this sort
could reduce our revenues from a tenant, could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any non-compliance, and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property.

Failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions.

We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to
qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). However, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future.



Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions and applicable income
tax regulations that have been issued under the Code. Certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in any
year must be derived from qualifying rents and other income. Satisfying this requirement could be difficult, for example, if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents. As a REIT, we must generally make annual
distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. In addition, new legislation, new regulations, new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as
a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income;

•

we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax;

•

unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during
which we were disqualified;

•

we could be required to pay significant income taxes, which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders
for each year in which we failed or were not permitted to qualify; and

•

we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders.

We may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a REIT.

As
a REIT, we must make generally annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. We are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain. In addition, we would be subject to a
4% excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income, capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply
with the Code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax. We may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because:

•

our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income; and

•

non-deductible capital expenditures, creation of reserves, or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income.

In these circumstances, we might have to borrow funds on unfavorable terms and we may have to borrow funds even if our management
believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive.

To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one
shareholder can own.

The Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our
outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code). To protect our REIT status, our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning (actually or
constructively) more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares. The constructive ownership rules are complex. Shares of our capital stock owned, actually or constructively, by a
group of related individuals and/or entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares and/or a class or series of
preferred shares (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity (or another) to own constructively more than 9.8% in value of the
outstanding stock. If that



happened, either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those
shares without violating the 9.8% ownership limit.

The Board of Trustees may waive these restrictions on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the Board of
Trustees and two-thirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The 9.8%
ownership restrictions may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest.

We cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.

Our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate, and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities, will depend on a number of
factors, including, among others, the following:

•

our financial condition and results of future operations;

•

the performance of lease terms by tenants;

•

the terms of our loan covenants; and

•

our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.

If we do not maintain or increase the dividend rate on our common shares, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities.
Any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares. Conversely, payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in
full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer.

Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of
our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control.

Certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the
Maryland General Corporation Law, as applicable to Maryland REITs, may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of
existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:

•

the REIT ownership limit described above;

•

authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers, preferences or rights to be determined by the Board of Trustees;

•

a staggered, fixed-size Board of Trustees consisting of three classes of trustees;

•

special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, by one-third of the trustees or by
shareholders possessing no less than 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;

•

the Board of Trustees, without a shareholder vote, can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest, including the reclassification of common
shares into preferred shares and vice-versa;

•

a two-thirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust;

•

advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings; and

•

a shareholder rights plan that provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our shareholders will be entitled to purchase from us a number of
common shares equal in value to two times the purchase price, which initially will be equal to $65 per share, subject to certain adjustments.



In addition, if we elect to be governed by it in the future, the Maryland control share acquisition law could delay or
prevent a change in control. Under Maryland law, unless a REIT elects not to be subject to this law, “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders
by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the REIT. “Control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to
exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power. A “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares, with some exceptions.

Our bylaws state that the Maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares. This bylaw provision may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether
before or after an acquisition of control shares, by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote, and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition.

We may amend or revise our business policies without your approval.

Our Board of Trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval. Our investment, financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities, such as growth, debt,
capitalization and operations, are determined by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion. A change in these policies could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities.

The current business plan adopted by our Board of Trustees focuses on our
investment in neighborhood and community shopping centers, principally through redevelopments and acquisitions. If this business plan is not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we make, including those in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully review the above risks and the risk
factors.

ITEM 1B.     UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

General

As of December 31, 2007, we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-used properties which are operated as 82 predominantly retail real estate projects
comprising approximately 18.2 million square feet. These properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, as well as
California. No single property accounted for over 10% of our 2007 total revenue. We believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism and business interruption insurance provided
by reputable companies, with commercially reasonable exclusions, deductibles and limits.

We operate our business on an asset management model, where asset
management teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets. We manage our portfolio as two operating regions: the East and West. Property management teams consist of asset managers, leasing agents, development staff and financial personnel each of
whom has responsibility for a distinct portfolio.



Tenant Diversification

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 2,400 leases, with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national retailers. No one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 2.5% of our annualized base rent
as of December 31, 2007. As a result of our tenant diversification, we believe our exposure to any recent and future bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant.

Geographic Diversification

Our 82 real estate projects are located
in 12 states and the District of Columbia. The following table shows, by region and state within the region, the number of projects, the gross leasable area of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial
space in each state as of December 31, 2007.

(1)

Additionally, we own two participating mortgages totaling approximately $28.3 million secured by multiple buildings in Manayunk, Pennsylvania.

Leases, Lease Terms and Lease Expirations

Our leases are classified
as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance, subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease, percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants, and
reimbursement of a majority of on-site operating expenses and real estate taxes. These features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales.

Commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years; however, certain leases, primarily with anchor tenants, may be longer. Many of our leases contain
tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at pre-established rental rates that often include fixed rent increases, consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent.
Leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and, in 2007, represented approximately 3.3% of total rental revenues.



The following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of
December 31, 2007 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2008 and after 2017 in the aggregate, in both cases, assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options. Annualized base rents reflect in-place contractual rents as
of December 31, 2007.



Retail and Residential Properties

The following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest, had a leasehold interest, or controlled and are consolidated as of December 31, 2007. Except as
otherwise noted, we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects. Principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract
retail customers.

All or a portion of this property is subject to a long-term ground lease.

(7)

This property contains nine buildings; six are subject to a leasehold interest, one is subject to a ground lease and two are owned 100% by us.

(8)

We own the controlling interest in this center.

On October 16, 2006, the Trust acquired control of Melville Mall through a 20 year master lease and secondary financing to the owner. The master lease includes a purchase
option in 2021 for $5.0 million plus the assumption of the owner’s $25.8 million first mortgage. Because the Trust controls this property and retains substantially all of the economic benefit and risk associated with it, we consolidate this
property and its operations.

(10)

We own a 90% general partnership interest in these buildings.

(11)

A portion of this property is subject to a capital lease obligation.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In May 2003, First National Mortgage Company filed a complaint against us
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleged that a one page document entitled “Final Proposal,” which included language that it was subject to approval of formal documentation,
constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our Santana Row property and gave First National Mortgage Company the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in accordance with a formula included
in the “Final Proposal.” A trial as to liability only was held in June 2006 and a jury rendered a verdict against us. A trial on the issue of damages has been set for April 2008. The complaint did not specify the amount of damages claimed.
We have now received reports from our experts and the plaintiff’s experts which show potential damages ranging from $600,000 to $24 million. We cannot make a reasonable estimate of potential damages until discovery is completed on the damages
issue and the court rules on various legal issues impacting the calculation of damages. We intend to appeal the jury verdict; however, no appeal of the judgment can be taken until the trial on damages has been completed. If we are not successful in
overturning the jury verdict, we will be liable for damages. Depending on the amount of damages awarded, it is possible there could be a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in which it becomes both probable that we will have to
pay the damages and such damages can be reasonably estimated. In any event, management does not believe it will have a material impact on our financial position.

We are also involved in a litigation matter relating to a shopping center in New Jersey where a former tenant has alleged that we and our management agent acted improperly by failing to disclose a condemnation action at the property that
was pending when the lease was signed. A trial as to liability only has been concluded and post-trial briefs have been filed, but no decision has been rendered. One of the plaintiffs in the matter has filed for bankruptcy protection and as a result,
the judge in our case has stayed further proceedings in the case. If we are found liable once the stay has been lifted, a trial will be held to determine the amount of damages. Based on the information available to us, we believe there is a
reasonable possibility that we will be found liable. If a verdict is rendered against us, we may seek indemnification from the third party management company that negotiated the lease on our behalf. We cannot assess with any certainty at this time
the potential damages for which we would be liable if a verdict is rendered against us or the potential amounts we might recover against the third party management company; however, if a verdict is rendered against us, there may be a material
adverse impact on our net income in the period in which it becomes both probable that we will have to pay the damages and such damages can be reasonably estimated. In any event, management does not believe it will have a material impact on our
financial position.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SHAREHOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of our
shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.



PART II

ITEM  5.

MARKET FOR OUR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS   AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “FRT.” Listed below are the high and low closing prices of our common shares as reported
on the New York Stock Exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated.

(1)

Includes regular dividend of $0.555 and special dividend of $0.20 resulting from the sales of condominiums at Santana Row.

On February 22, 2008, there were 4,385 holders of record of our common shares.

Our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our REIT status and distribute to shareholders at least 100% of our
REIT taxable income. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income. State income taxes are not material to our
operations or cash flows.

Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for
common shareholders, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Board of Trustees deems relevant. We have paid quarterly dividends to our
shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 40 consecutive years.

Our total annual
dividends paid per common share for 2007 and 2006 were $2.335 per share and $2.440 per share (including a $0.20 special dividend), respectively. The annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes.
Distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and
profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares, to the extent thereof, and thereafter as taxable capital gain. Distributions that are treated as a reduction of the
shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain, or reducing the amount of loss, recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares. No assurances can be given regarding what portion, if any, of
distributions in 2008 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. During a year in which a REIT earns a net long-term capital gain, the REIT can elect under Code Sec. 857(b)(3) to designate a portion of
dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends. If this election is made, then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as long-term capital gains.



The following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders:

(1)

Includes a special dividend of $0.20 resulting from the sales of condominiums at Santana Row.

Distributions on our 5.417% Series 1 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares were paid at the rate of $1.354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of March 8, 2007. We do not believe that the
preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common
shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.

Distributions on our 8.5% Series B Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Shares were paid at the rate of $2.125 per share per annum, prior to distributions on our common shares. On November 27, 2006, the Trust redeemed all 5,400,000 outstanding shares of our 8.5% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Shares at their redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date of $0.159 per share.

Recent Sales
of Unregistered Shares

All equity securities sold by us during 2007 that were not registered have been previously reported in a Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

No equity securities were purchased by us during 2007. However, 2,326 common shares were placed into treasury as a result of restricted shares forfeited by former
employees.



ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table includes certain financial information on a
consolidated historical basis. You should read this section in conjunction with “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.” Our selected operating data, other data and balance sheet data for the years ended 2003 through 2006 has been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the year ended 2007.



(1)

Property operating income consists of rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes. This measure is used internally
to evaluate the performance of our regional operations, and we consider it to be a significant measure.

(2)

Determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows.

(3)

The 2006 and 2005 dividends declared per common share each include a special dividend of $0.20 resulting from the sales of condominiums at Santana Row.

(4)

Funds from Operations (“FFO”) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performances. The National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with the U.S. GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains on the sale of real estate. We
compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and we have historically reported our FFO available for common shareholders in addition to our net income.

We consider FFO available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption
that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of GAAP and the recording of depreciation. We use FFO primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in
comparison with other REITs. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. Additional
information regarding our calculation of FFO is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

The reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows:



(5)

Includes $3.1 million and $8.0 million of insurance recoveries in 2004 and 2003, respectively, attributable to rental income lost at Santana Row as a result of the August 2002
fire. Insurance recoveries received in 2005 were insignificant.

The SEC has stated that EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure as calculated in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that means net income or loss plus net interest expense,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate and impairments of real estate if any. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe that it provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to service
debt and because it approximates a key covenant in material notes. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as presented
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other REITs.

The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net
income for the periods presented is as follows:

Fixed charges consist of interest on borrowed funds (including capitalized interest), amortization of debt discount and expense and the portion of rent expense representing an
interest factor. Preferred share dividends consist of dividends paid on preferred shares and preferred stock redemption costs. Our Series A preferred shares were redeemed in full in June 2003 and our Series B preferred shares were redeemed in
full in November 2006.

ITEM  7.    MANAGEMENT’S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Overview

We are an equity real estate investment
trust specializing in the ownership, management, development and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2007, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and
mixed-use properties which are operated as 82 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 18.2 million square feet. These properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic
metropolitan markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States, as well as in California. In total, these 82 real estate projects were 96.7% leased at December 31, 2007. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned
seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 1.0 million square feet as of December 31, 2007. In total, the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 98.3% leased at December 31, 2007. We have paid
quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 40 consecutive years.



Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which we refer to as GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain
circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past and current
events and economic conditions. In addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary,
information obtained from consultations with third party experts. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report.
Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate or accrual results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

The most significant accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that
differ from estimates, are as follows:

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease. Base rents are recognized on a straight-line
basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease, net of valuation adjustments, based on management’s assessment of credit, collection and other business risk. We make estimates of the collectibility of our
accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income taking into account our expertise in the retail sector, tenant credit information both internally and externally available, payment
history, industry trends, tenant credit-worthiness and the length of remaining lease terms over which certain of these amounts will be collected. In some cases, primarily relating to straight-line rents, the collection of these amounts extends
beyond one year. Our experience relative to unbilled straight-line rents is that a certain portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications,
bankruptcies and other factors. Accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of
such income is reasonably assured. If our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straight-line revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized, the additional straight-line rental income is recognized as
revenue. If our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straight-line rental income is no longer collectible, a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, accounts receivable
include approximately $32.0 million and $24.8 million, respectively, related to straight-line rents. These estimates have a direct impact on our net income.

Historically, we have recognized bad debt expense between 0.4% and 1.4% of rental income and it was 0.4% in 2007. An increase in our bad debt expense would decrease our net income. For example, if we had experienced an increase in bad debt
of 0.5% of rental income in 2007, our net income would have been reduced by approximately $2.3 million.

Real Estate

The nature of our business as an owner, redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixed-use properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital.
Depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole. We capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them in accordance with GAAP and consistent with industry
standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives. The cost of our real estate investments, less



salvage value, if any, is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the asset using straight-line rates for financial statement purposes. We
periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes, as necessary, to these estimates and, therefore, to our depreciation rates. These reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets, the
repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets, the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors. A newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically
have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years, but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings, estimating the useful lives of assets that are long-lived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment.
Certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize
the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues. These assessments have a direct impact on
our net income. The longer the economic useful life, the lower the depreciation charged to that asset in a fiscal period will be, which in turn will increase our net income. Similarly, having a shorter economic useful life would increase the
depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income.

Land, buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost. We compute
depreciation using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant work and other
major improvements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are
capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15 years. Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real estate, including applicable salaries and the related direct
costs, are capitalized. The capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement. Capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease.
Unamortized leasing costs are charged to operating expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease. Undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced.

When applicable, as lessee, we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” We are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term, the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in
applying the provisions of SFAS No. 13. These estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset.

Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and
expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use. Generally, rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements, but no later
than one year from completion of major construction activity. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in
calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period.

Real Estate Acquisitions

Upon acquisition of operating real estate
properties, we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements), identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above-market and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant
relationships), and assumed debt in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the



applicable assets and liabilities. We utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and
liabilities. We evaluate the useful life of each amortizable intangible asset each reporting period and account for any changes in such estimated useful life over the revised remaining useful life.

Long-Lived Assets

There are estimates and assumptions made by
management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets, including our properties that have been acquired or
developed. Management must evaluate properties for possible impairment of value and, for those properties where impairment may be indicated, make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and
development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over very long periods. Because our properties typically have a very long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value
requires significant management judgment.

SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” requires that one
accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly-acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash
flows that can be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity. As a result, the sale of a property, or the classification of a property as held for sale, requires us to report the results of
operations of that property as “discontinued operations.”

We are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining whether
there is an impairment of an asset. Actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. These estimates have a direct impact on net income, because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income.

Contingencies

We are sometimes involved in lawsuits,
warranty claims, and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters.

Any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income. In addition, we reserve for
estimated losses, if any, associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale, taking any insurance policies into account. These warranties may extend up to ten years and the
calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment. Any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income.

Self-Insurance

We are self-insured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim, and
we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. We currently do not maintain third party stop-loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. Our accrual for self-insurance
liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Management considers a number of factors, including third-party actuary valuations and future increases in costs of claims,
when making these determinations. If our liability costs differ from these accruals, it will increase or decrease our net income.



New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, except for share-based payments under SFAS No. 123(R). We are
required to adopt the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are re-measured at least annually effective January 1,
2008; we are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 157 for all other nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective January 1, 2009. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is
effective for the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not intend to make this fair value election and, therefore, we do not expect SFAS No. 159 to have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141 (R)”) and
Statement No. 160 “

Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51”

(“SFAS No. 160”). The new standards significantly change the accounting
and reporting of business combination transactions and minority interests in the consolidated financial statements; these changes include expensing all acquisition related transaction costs, recognizing contingent consideration arrangements at their
acquisition date fair values with subsequent changes generally reflected in earnings, recognizing 100% of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions of less than 100% controlling interest and recognizing a
non-controlling interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 141 (R) for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009 and SFAS No. 160 on
January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.



Property Acquisitions and Dispositions

A summary of our significant acquisitions in 2007 and 2006 is as follows:

(1)

Approximately $0.4 million and $1.8 million of the net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for “above market leases” and liabilities for “below market
leases,” respectively.

(2)

The White Marsh Portfolio was purchased using $11.5 million of cash plus a combination of common stock and convertible preferred stock, downREIT operating partnership units, and the
assumption of mortgage loans through a merger with Nottingham Properties, Inc. The acquisition also included ground leases covering 50,000 square feet of office space and a hotel which are not included in gross leasable area.

(3)

Approximately $3.6 million and $9.3 million of the net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for “above market leases” and liabilities for “below market
leases,” respectively.

(4)

Approximately $0.8 million and $2.1 million of the net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for “above market leases” and liabilities for “below market
leases,” respectively.

(5)

On October 26, 2007, we completed an exchange transaction whereby we sold our leasehold interests in six New Jersey properties and acquired the fee interests in Mid-Pike Plaza
and Huntington Shopping Center. Prior to the transaction, we held leasehold interests in all eight properties. The transaction was completed as a 1031 tax-deferred exchange and involved a cash payment of $17.2 million. All eight properties were
previously encumbered by capital lease obligations which were extinguished as part of the transaction.

(6)

We acquired an additional 30,000 square feet of gross leasable area in 2007.



(7)

The Trust controls and consolidates Melville Mall at its approximate fair value of $60.0 million. We gained control of Melville Mall through a 20-year master lease and $34.1 million
secondary financing to the owner. The master lease includes a purchase option in 2021 for $5.0 million plus the assumption of the owner’s first mortgage that has a balance of $25.1 million at December 31, 2007.

Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised
through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. On occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, or downREIT units as well as through the assumption of mortgages.

On November 16, 2007, we purchased the 10% minority interest in three properties located at our Fifth Avenue, Hermosa Avenue and Third Street Promenade projects for
$5.7 million. We now own 100% of these properties.

The Linden Square acquisition is currently undergoing redevelopment. After the initial phases of the
redevelopment are completed the project will include approximately 222,000 square feet of retail, 17,000 square feet of office, seven affordable residential units, and a car dealership. The initial phases of redevelopment are expected to be complete
in 2008.

The following table provides a summary of acquisitions made by our unconsolidated real estate partnership in 2007 and 2006:

(1)

The property acquired is adjacent to and operated as part of Barcroft Plaza which is also owned by the Partnership.

(2)

This property was acquired from the Trust.



A summary of our significant dispositions in 2007 and 2006 is as follows:

(1)

Gain of $0.6 million is net of $0.3 million in taxes.

(2)

Gain of $0.4 million is net of $0.1 million in taxes.

(3)

Gain of $0.5 million is net of $0.1 million in taxes.

(4)

We sold two of three retail buildings located in Forest Hills, NY.

(5)

On October 26, 2007, we completed an exchange transaction whereby we sold our leasehold interests in six New Jersey properties and acquired the fee interests in Mid-Pike Plaza
and Huntington Shopping Center. The transaction was completed as a 1031 tax-deferred exchange and involved a cash payment of $17.2 million. All eight properties were previously encumbered by capital lease obligations which were extinguished as part
of the transaction.

(6)

As of August 25, 2006, we had sold all of the 219 condominium units we planned to sell at Santana Row.

(7)

Gain of $16.5 million is net of $2.4 million in taxes.

(8)

This property was contributed to our real estate partnership in which we own a 30% interest. Accordingly, we recognized a partial gain of $7.4 million on this sale related to the
70% equity interest contributed.



The proceeds from our dispositions were used to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate
purposes.

Warranty reserves for condominium units sold at Santana Row were established to cover potential costs for materials, labor and other items
associated with warranty-type claims that may arise within the ten-year statutorily mandated latent construction defect warranty period. Our warranty and latent construction defect reserves are calculated based upon historical industry experience
and current known factors. Variables used in the calculation of the warranty reserves, as well as the adequacy of the reserves based on the number of condominium units still under warranty, are reviewed on a periodic basis.

During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we became aware of certain facts and circumstances that caused us to reassess our initial reserve for damages related to
defective work done by third party contractors while upgrades were made to the units being prepared for sale. Based on current estimates, we believe the range of possible incremental cost is between $5.1 million and $9.3 million, net of taxes of
$1.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, before insurance recoveries. The full extent of damages and required repairs on any particular unit cannot be determined until we have evaluated whether there was defective work in the unit and determined
the extent of damages (if any) caused by the defective work. We are still in the process of evaluating units for potential damage arising from the defective work and, to date, have completed the repairs caused by the defective work in only a limited
number of units. The extent of the damages encountered in those units, and the resulting costs to repair, varied considerably. Accordingly, our current estimates are based on limited and varying actual costs. We are continuing our evaluation of this
matter, and in 2007, we increased our reserves by $5.1 million, net of taxes of $1.9 million, to the low end of our estimated range of potential obligation related to these particular damages. This range excludes any amounts we may recover from
insurance or the contractors responsible for the defective work. In the event that our evaluation allows us to develop a better estimate of these damages, we will adjust our estimate accordingly. This increase reduces our gain on sale of condominium
units that were sold during 2005 and 2006. The increase in the reserve is included in “Discontinued operations—gain on sale of real estate”. The reserve is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Although we consider the
reserve to be adequate, there can be no assurance that the reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to the difference between the assumptions used to estimate the reserve and actual losses.

2007 Significant Debt, Equity and Other Transactions

On
March 8, 2007, as part of the consideration to acquire the White Marsh portfolio, we issued (i) 884,066 common shares at $88.18 per share, par value $0.01 per share, (ii) 399,896 shares of 5.417% Series 1 Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Shares (“Series 1 Preferred Shares”) at the liquidation preference of $25 per share, par value $0.01 per share, and (iii) 185,504 downREIT operating partnership units at $88.18 per share. The Series 1 Preferred Shares accrue
dividends at a rate of 5.417% per year and are convertible at any time by the holders to our common shares at a conversion rate of $104.69 per share. The Series 1 Preferred Shares are also convertible under certain circumstances at our
election. The holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares have no voting rights.

In connection with the acquisition of the White Marsh portfolio and
Shoppers’ World, we assumed five mortgage notes as follows:

(1)

The aggregate face amount of the mortgage notes is $79.7 million. However, in accordance with GAAP, these mortgage notes were recorded at their fair value of $80.0 million.



On April 10, 2007, our unconsolidated real estate partnership entered into a mortgage note for approximately $4.2
million. The mortgage note is secured by the Lake Barcroft property which was acquired in February 2007 and by Barcroft Plaza. The Lake Barcroft property is adjacent to and operated as part of Barcroft Plaza. The note matures on July 1, 2016,
bears interest at 5.71% per annum and requires monthly payments of interest only.

On October 26, 2007, we acquired the fee interest in Mid-Pike
Plaza and Huntington Shopping Center and sold our leasehold interest in six properties, Allwood, Blue Star, Brunswick, Clifton, Hamilton and Rutgers Shopping Centers. Prior to the transaction, we had capital lease obligations totaling $76.4 million
on all eight properties. The capital lease obligations were extinguished as part of the transactions.

On November 9, 2007, we entered into a $200
million unsecured term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 57.5 basis points. The loan matures on November 6, 2008, subject to a one-year extension at our option and is prepayable without penalty. The spread over LIBOR is subject to adjustment
based on our credit rating.

On November 15, 2007, we repaid our 6.125% senior notes with a principal amount of $150.0 million. These notes were
repaid with funds borrowed on our $200 million unsecured term loan.

On December 27, 2007, we issued 2.0 million common shares at $81.21 per
share, for cash proceeds of approximately $162.4 million before other expenses of the offering. The proceeds were used on an interim basis to repay our revolving credit facility.

Effective December 31, 2007, Larry Finger, our former Chief Financial Officer, was no longer employed by the Trust. Under his existing severance agreement, his departure was treated as a termination without
cause. As a result, we recognized approximately $0.6 million related to the accelerated vesting of unvested shares and options and $0.4 million related to a cash payment to Mr. Finger. These amounts are included in general and administrative
expenses in the consolidated statement of income.

Outlook

General

We anticipate our 2008 income from continuing operations to grow in comparison to our 2007 income from continuing operations. We
expect this income growth primarily to be generated by a combination of the following:

•

increased earnings in our same-center portfolio and from properties under redevelopment; and

•

increased earnings as we expand our portfolio through property acquisitions.

On October 31, 2007, we announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share on our common shares, resulting in an indicated annual rate of $2.44 per share. The regular common dividend was payable on
January 15, 2008, to common shareholders of record as of January 2, 2008.

We continue to see a positive impact on our income as a result of the
redevelopment of our shopping centers and higher rental rates on existing spaces as leases on these spaces expire. For example, leases signed in 2005, 2006 and 2007 on spaces for which there was a previous tenant have on average been renewed at
double digit cash base rent increases. On spaces where the tenant leases are expiring over the next few years, our analysis of current market rents as compared to rents on the existing leases leads us to expect that the base rents on new leases will
have double-digit weighted average increases over the cash basis base rents currently in place. We anticipate investments in redevelopment projects of approximately $104 million and $55 million to stabilize in 2008 and 2009, respectively. As
redevelopment properties are completed, spaces that were out of service begin generating revenue; in addition, spaces that were not out of service and that have expiring leases may generate higher revenue because we generally receive higher rent on
new leases.



At December 31, 2007 the leasable square feet in our shopping centers was 95.4% occupied and 96.7% leased. The
leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved, or that are awaiting permits and therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. Our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over
time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies.

Acquisitions

We anticipate further growth in earnings from the acquisition of neighborhood and community shopping centers in our primary
markets in the East and West regions, as well as a reduction in earnings from selective dispositions. We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions in additional markets.

Any growth in earnings from acquisitions is contingent, however, on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates also may
affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisitions.

Results of Operations

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2007 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006

Same-center

Throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a “same-center” basis. Information provided on a same-center basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both



periods being compared except for properties for which significant development, redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being
compared and properties classified as discontinued operations.

Property Revenues

Total property revenue increased $58.4 million, or 13.6%, to $485.9 million in 2007 compared to $427.5 million in 2006. The percentage leased at our shopping centers increased to 96.7% at December 31,
2007 compared to 96.5% at December 31, 2006. Changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.

Rental Income

Rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost recoveries from tenants and percentage rent. Rental income increased $53.5 million, or 12.9%, to $468.5
million in 2007 compared to $415.0 million in 2006, due primarily to the following:

•

an increase of $32.0 million attributable to properties acquired in 2007 and 2006 and the completion of the power-center at Assembly Square Mall,

•

an increase of $11.6 million at same-center properties due to increased rental rates on new leases and increased cost recoveries,

•

an increase of $8.9 million at redevelopment properties due to increased occupancy, increased rental rates on new leases and increased cost recoveries,

•

an increase of $2.2 million at Santana Row residential due primarily to leasing of residential units,

partially offset by

•

a decrease of $0.8 million related to the sale of Greenlawn Plaza to our unconsolidated real estate partnership in June 2006.

Other Property Income

Other property income increased $5.4 million,
or 72.0%, to $12.8 million in 2007 compared to $7.5 million in 2006. Included in other property income are items which, although recurring, tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period, such as lease termination fees. In
2007, the increase is primarily due to an increase in lease and other termination fees at our same-center properties, an increase in marketing income, and an increase in management fee income.

Property Expenses

Total property expenses increased $21.7 million,
or 17.2%, to $147.6 million in 2007 compared to $126.0 million in 2006. Changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.

Rental
Expenses

Rental expenses increased $15.6 million, or 18.4%, to $100.4 million in 2007 compared to $84.8 million in 2006. This increase
is due primarily to the following:

•

an increase of $5.7 million attributable to properties acquired in 2007 and 2006 and the completion of the power-center at Assembly Square Mall,

•

an increase of $4.6 million in repairs and maintenance at same-center and redevelopment properties due primarily to higher snow removal and maintenance costs,



•

an increase of $1.3 million in bad debt expense at same-center and redevelopment properties due to amounts recovered in 2006 of receivables previously deemed
uncollectible,

•

an increase of $1.1 million in utilities at same-center and redevelopment properties,

•

an increase of $0.9 million in legal fees related to the litigation at a shopping center in New Jersey and at Santana Row,

•

an increase of $0.8 million in insurance at same-center and redevelopment projects, and

•

an increase of $0.7 million attributable to Santana Row residential.

As a result of the changes in rental income, rental expenses and other property income described above, rental expenses as a percentage of rental income plus other property income increased to 20.9% in 2007 from 20.1%
in 2006.

Real Estate Taxes

Real estate tax expense
increased $6.0 million, or 14.7%, to $47.2 million in 2007 compared to $41.2 million in 2006. This increase is due primarily to increased taxes of $3.8 million related to properties acquired in 2007 and 2006 and Assembly Square Mall and $2.4
million related to higher assessments at our same-center, redevelopment and Santana Row residential properties.

Property Operating Income

Property operating income increased $36.7 million, or 12.2%, to $338.3 million in 2007 compared to $301.6 million in 2006. This increase is
due primarily to the following:

•

earnings attributable to properties acquired in 2007 and 2006 and the completion of the power-center at Assembly Square Mall,

•

growth in same-center earnings,

•

growth in earnings at redevelopment properties, and

•

growth in earnings at Santana Row residential.

Other

Interest Expense

Interest
expense increased $16.1 million, or 16.9%, to $111.4 million in 2007 compared to $95.2 million in 2006. This increase is primarily due to the following:

•

an increase of $23.4 million due to higher borrowings to finance our acquisitions,

partially offset by

•

an increase of $3.8 million in capitalized interest,

•

a decrease of $1.8 million due to a lower overall weighted average borrowing rate, and

•

a decrease of $1.4 million due to the termination of the Mid-Pike and Huntington capital leases on October 26, 2007, as part of the acquisition of the fee
interests in these properties.

Gross interest costs were $119.2 million and $99.3 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Capitalized interest amounted to $7.9 million and $4.1 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalized interest increased due primarily to redevelopment at Linden Square, which was acquired in 2006, and redevelopment at Arlington East
(Bethesda Row).



General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense increased $4.2 million, or 19.8%, to $25.6 million in 2007 compared to $21.3 million in 2006. This is primarily due to an increase in personnel, primarily in our asset
management department, and increased share-based and other compensation expense. Approximately $1.0 million of the increase is due to additional stock and other compensation expense related to the departure of Larry Finger, our Chief Financial
Officer, effective December 31, 2007.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.9 million, or 9.6%, to $101.7 million in 2007 from $92.8 million in 2006. This increase is due primarily to acquisitions and capital improvements at
same-center and redevelopment properties.

Minority Interests

Income to minority partners increased $1.2 million, or 28.4%, to $5.6 million in 2007 from $4.4 million in 2006. This increase is due primarily to an increase in earnings at properties held in non-wholly owned partnerships
and an increase in operating partnership units issued to acquire the White Marsh portfolio in March 2007.

Discontinued Operations—Income

Income from discontinued operations represents the income of properties that have been disposed, or will be disposed, which is required to be reported
separately from results of ongoing operations. The reported income of $4.4 million and $4.2 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, represent the income for the period during which we owned properties sold, or deemed held for sale, in 2007
and 2006.

Discontinued Operations

Gain on Sale of Real Estate

The gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations of $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 is due to a $100.2 million gain primarily related
to the sales of Bath Shopping Center, Key Road Plaza, Riverside Plaza, two properties in Forest Hills, and Allwood, Blue Star, Brunswick, Clifton, Hamilton and Rutgers Shopping Centers, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in the
reserve, net of taxes, for the reassessment of damages in 2007 of defective work completed when making upgrades to certain condominiums sold in 2006 and 2005 at Santana Row. The gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations of $16.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2006, was due to the sale of condominiums at Santana Row.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate

The gain on sale of real estate includes properties in which we maintained continuing involvement through our unconsolidated real estate partnership. No properties in
which we maintained continuing involvement were sold in 2007. One property, Greenlawn Plaza, was sold in 2006 to our unconsolidated real estate partnership, which resulted in a $7.4 million gain.



YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005

Property Revenues

Total property revenues increased $36.7 million, or 9.4%, to $427.5 million in 2006 compared to $390.8 million in 2005. The percentage leased at our commercial properties increased to 96.5% at December 31, 2006 compared to
96.3% at December 31, 2005 due primarily to new leases signed at existing properties. Changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.

Rental income

Rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost recoveries from tenants, and percentage rent. Rental income increased
$39.1 million, or 10.4%, to $415.0 million in 2006 compared to $375.9 million in 2005. This increase is due primarily to the following:

•

an increase of $17.8 million attributable to the properties acquired in 2006 and 2005,

•

an increase of $10.1 million at same-center properties due primarily to increased rental rates on new leases and increased occupancy,

•

an increase of $6.6 million at redevelopment properties due primarily to increased occupancy and increased rental rates on new leases, and

•

an increase of $6.5 million at Santana Row due primarily to leasing newly constructed residential units, increased rental rates on new retail leases, and increased
occupancy,

partially offset by

•

a decrease of $1.0 million related to the sale of Greenlawn Plaza to our unconsolidated real estate partnership in June 2006.



Other Property Income

Other property income decreased $2.1 million, or 21.6%, to $7.5 million in 2006 compared to $9.5 million in 2005. Included in other property income are items which, although recurring, tend to fluctuate more than rental
income from period to period, such as lease termination fees and temporary tenant income. In 2006, the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in lease termination fees.

Property Expenses

Total property operating expenses increased $7.5 million, or 6.3%, to $126.0 million in 2006
compared to $118.5 million in 2005. Changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.

Rental Expenses

Rental expenses increased $2.7 million, or 3.3%, to $84.8 million in 2006 compared to $82.1 million in 2005. This increase is primarily due to the
following:

•

an increase of $2.9 million in expenses attributable to properties acquired in 2006 and 2005,

•

an increase of $2.5 million at Santana Row due primarily to higher repair and maintenance expenses and common area costs associated with newly constructed
residential units placed into service, and

•

an increase of $0.9 million in utility costs at same-center and redevelopment properties,

partially offset by

•

a decrease of $1.2 million in bad debt expense due to recoveries in 2006 of receivables previously deemed uncollectible, and

•

a decrease of $1.0 million in repairs and maintenance expense at same-center and redevelopment properties due primarily to a decrease in snow removal costs.

As a result of these changes in rental expenses, rental income and other property income, rental expense as a percentage of rental
income plus other property income decreased to 20.1% in 2006 from 21.3% in 2005.

Real Estate Taxes

Real estate tax expense increased $4.7 million, or 13.0%, to $41.2 million in 2006 compared to $36.4 million in 2005. The increase is due to the following:

•

an increase of $2.3 million attributable to properties acquired in 2006 and 2005,

•

an increase of $2.1 million at Santana Row due primarily to higher assessments and a change in estimated real estate taxes recorded in June 2005. This change in
estimate resulted from our receipt of the final real estate tax assessments, which decreased our real estate taxes for retail real estate and increased our real estate taxes for residential units at Santana Row by $1.1 million in 2005. The related
residential units impacted by this change in estimate were sold as condominiums and, therefore, the increase in residential real estate taxes is included in discontinued operations as discussed below, and

•

an increase of $0.4 million due to higher assessments at same-center properties.

Property Operating Income

Property operating income increased $29.3 million, or 10.7%, to $301.6 million in
2006 compared to $272.3 million in 2005. This increase is due primarily to the following:

•

earnings attributable to properties acquired in 2006 and 2005,



•

growth in same-center earnings, and

•

growth in earnings at redevelopment properties and Santana Row.

Other

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $13.6 million, or 16.7%, to $95.2 million in 2006 compared to $81.6 million in 2005. This increase is due primarily to the following:

•

an increase of $8.0 million due to higher borrowings to finance our acquisitions,

•

an increase of $3.6 million due to higher interest rates on certain borrowings,

•

an increase of $1.6 million due to a decrease in capitalized interest.

Gross interest costs were $99.3 million and $87.3 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized interest amounted to $4.1 million and $5.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalized
interest decreased due primarily to the placement into service of newly constructed residential rental units at Santana Row and retail development at Assembly Square, partially offset by capitalized interest related to construction at Linden Square,
which was acquired in 2006.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 7.2%, to $21.3 million in 2006 compared to $19.9 million in 2005. This is primarily due to an increase in compensation (including increased grant expense under
SFAS No. 123(R)), partially offset by an increase in compensation capitalized as a result of increased redevelopment activities.

Depreciation and
Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.3 million, or 9.8%, to $92.8 million in 2006 compared to $84.5 million in 2005.
This increase is due primarily to depreciation on acquired properties, improvements at same-center properties, the placement into service of the newly constructed residential rental units at Santana Row, and retail development at Assembly Square.

Minority Interests

Income to minority partners
decreased $0.9 million, or 16.8%, to $4.4 million in 2006 from $5.2 million in 2005. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in earnings at a property under redevelopment which is held in a non-wholly owned partnership, and a
decrease in operating units held by partners in certain of our “downREIT” partnerships.

Discontinued Operations—Income

Income from discontinued operations represents the income of properties that have been disposed or will be disposed, which is required to be reported separately from
results of ongoing operations. The reported income of $4.2 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, represents the income for the period during which we owned properties sold or to be sold between
2005 and 2007.

Discontinued Operations

Gain on Sale of Real Estate

The gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations of $16.5 million for 2006 is due to the sale of condominiums at Santana Row. The gain on sale of real estate
from discontinued operations of $30.7 million for 2005 was due to the sales of properties in Tempe, Arizona and Winter Park, Florida, Shaw’s Plaza in Carver, Massachusetts and condominiums at Santana Row in San Jose, California.



Gain on Sale of Real Estate

The gain on sale of real estate includes properties in which we maintained continuing involvement through our unconsolidated real estate partnership. One property, Greenlawn Plaza, was sold in 2006 to our unconsolidated real estate
partnership, which resulted in a $7.4 million gain. No properties in which we maintained continuing involvement were sold in 2005.

Segment Results

We operate our business on an asset management model, where asset management teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets. We manage our portfolio as
two operating regions: East and West. Property management teams consist of asset managers, leasing agents, development staff and financial personnel, each of whom has responsibility for a distinct portfolio.

The following selected key segment data is presented for 2007, 2006 and 2005. The results of properties classified as discontinued operations have been excluded from
rental income, total revenue, and property operating income from the following table.

(1)

Property operating income consists of rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes. This measure is used internally
to evaluate the performance of our regional operations, and we consider it to be a significant measure.

East

Rental income for the East region increased $45.5 million, or 14.3%, to $363.7 million in 2007 compared to $318.2 million in 2006 due primarily to the following:

•

an increase of $31.3 million attributable to properties acquired in 2007 and 2006 and the completion of the power-center at Assembly Square Mall,

•

an increase of $9.0 million at same-center properties due to increased rental rates on new leases and increased cost recoveries, and

•

an increase of $6.4 million at redevelopment properties,

partially offset by

•

a decrease of $0.8 million related to the sale of Greenlawn Plaza to our unconsolidated real estate partnership in June 2006.



Property operating income for the East region increased $30.7 million in 2007 due primarily to the increase in rental
income discussed above and an increase of $2.8 million in lease and other termination fees. These increases in income were partially offset by a $13.7 million increase in rental expense due to the acquisition of properties, increased snow removal
costs, repairs and maintenance costs, insurance costs, and additional legal costs and a $5.5 million increase in real estate taxes due primarily to the acquisition of properties and higher assessments on our same-center and redevelopment properties.
As a result of these changes, the ratio of property operating income to total revenue for the East region decreased to 71.2% in 2007 from 72.7% in 2006.

Rental income for the East region increased $25.5 million, or 8.7%, to $318.2 million in 2006 compared to $292.7 million in 2005 due primarily to the following:

•

an increase of $12.4 million attributable to properties acquired in 2006 and 2005,

•

an increase of $9.4 million at same-center properties due to increased rental rates on new leases and increased cost recoveries, and

•

an increase of $6.6 million at redevelopment properties,

partially offset by

•

a decrease of $1.0 million related to the sale of Greenlawn Plaza to our unconsolidated real estate partnership in June 2006.

Property operating income for the East region increased $22.6 million in 2006 due primarily to the increase in rental income discussed above. These increases in income
were partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in rental expense primarily due to the acquisition of properties offset by lower snow removal costs, and a $2.5 million increase in real estate taxes due primarily to the acquisition of properties and
increased assessments at same-center properties. As a result of these changes, the ratio of property operating income to total revenue for the East region increased to 72.7% in 2006 from 71.5% in 2005.

West

Rental income for the West region increased $8.0 million, or
8.3%, to $104.8 million in 2007 from $96.8 million in 2006 due primarily to the following:

•

an increase of $4.0 million at Santana Row due to leasing residential units throughout 2006, increased retail occupancy and increased rental rates on new retail
leases, and

•

an increase of $2.5 million at a redevelopment project.

Property operating income for the West region increased $6.0 million in 2007 due primarily to the increase in rental income discussed above, partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in rental expense and real estate taxes primarily at
Santana Row and a $0.4 million decrease in mortgage interest income due to an amendment of our $17.7 million mortgage note receivable secured by the hotel at our Santana Row project in San Jose, California, which was executed on
August 14, 2006 and decreased the interest rate from 14% per annum to 9% per annum. As a result of these changes, the ratio of property operating income to total revenue for the West region increased to 64.1% in 2007 from 63.6% in
2006.

Rental income for the West region increased $13.6 million, or 16.3%, to $96.8 million in 2006 from $83.2 million in 2005 due primarily to the
following:

•

an increase of $6.5 million at Santana Row due to leasing residential units throughout 2006 and increased retail occupancy, and

•

an increase of $5.4 million attributable to the acquisition of Crow Canyon Commons in 2005.



Property operating income for the West region increased $6.7 million in 2006 due primarily to the increase in rental
income discussed above, partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in rental expense and real estate taxes primarily at Santana Row and a $2.5 million decrease in other property income primarily due to a decrease in lease termination fees. The
ratio of property operating income to total revenue for the West region stayed constant at 63.6% in 2006 and 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Due to the nature of our business and strategy, we generally generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is
primarily paid to our shareholders in the form of dividends. As a REIT, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.

Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases, normal recurring operating expenses, regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to
additional or replacement debt, as well as scheduled debt maturities), recurring expenditures, non-recurring expenditures (such as tenant improvements and redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. Overall capital
requirements in 2008 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of future phases of existing properties.

Our long-term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our long-term debt agreements, development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions.
We expect to fund these through a combination of sources which we believe will be available to us, including additional and replacement unsecured and secured borrowings, issuance of additional equity, joint venture relationships relating to existing
properties or new acquisitions, and property dispositions.

The cash needed to execute our strategy and invest in new properties, as well as to pay our
debt at maturity, must come from one or more of the following sources:

•

cash provided by operations that is not distributed to shareholders,

•

proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity securities, or

•

proceeds from property dispositions.

It is
management’s intention that we continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business. As a result, we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain
strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. We may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds by the following means:

•

additional equity offerings,

•

unsecured debt financing and/or secured mortgage financings, and

•

other debt and equity alternatives, including formation of joint ventures, in a manner consistent with our intention to operate with a conservative debt structure.

The following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements:

•

we may be unable to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, as a result of our financial condition or market conditions at the time we seek
additional financing;

•

restrictions in our debt instruments or preferred stock equity may prohibit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at all, or on acceptable terms under
then-prevailing market conditions; and

•

we may be unable to service additional or replacement debt due to increases in interest rates or a decline in our operating performance.



We seek to maintain a staggered schedule of debt maturities such that a disproportionate amount of debt maturities does
not occur in any one year. Consistent therewith, we have less than $220 million of debt maturities occurring through December 31, 2008, $200 million of which can be extended for one-year at our option. Despite the current turmoil in the credit
markets, we believe that we will be able to refinance these maturities.

Cash and cash equivalents were $50.7 million and $11.5 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents are not a good indicator of our liquidity. We have a $300.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures July 27, 2010, subject to a one-year extension at our
option. No amounts were outstanding on the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2007. We intend to utilize our revolving credit facility to finance the initial acquisition of properties and meet other short-term working capital
requirements.

Summary of Cash Flows for 2007 and 2006

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $27.6 million to $214.2 million during the year ended
December 31, 2007 from $186.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to:

•

$10.0 million higher net income before gain on sale of real estate, depreciation and amortization, minority interest and other non-cash items, and

•

$17.6 million increase in cash provided for working capital due primarily to lower prepaid expenses and other assets and higher prepaid rent balances.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased approximately $166.0 million to $151.4 million during the year ended December 31,
2007 from $317.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was due primarily to:

•

$197.5 million decrease in acquisitions of real estate,

partially offset by

•

$17.7 million increase in capital expenditures due primarily to an increase in development and redevelopment activities, and

•

$15.5 million increase in capital contributions to our unconsolidated real estate partnership to fund acquisitions.

Net cash used in financing activities increased approximately $157.2 million to $23.6 million used during the year ended December 31, 2007 from $133.6 million
provided during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was due primarily to:

•

$509.9 million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2006 and no issuances of senior notes in 2007,

•

$139.2 million increase in net repayments on our revolving credit facility,

•

$109.5 million increase in repayment of senior notes, and



•

$2.2 million increase in distributions to minority interests,

partially offset by

•

$397.9 million decrease in repayment of mortgages, capital leases and notes payable,

•

$135.0 million redemption of Series B preferred shares in 2006,

•

$49.5 million increase in net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable,

•

$12.7 million increase in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares, and

•

$8.4 million decrease in dividends paid to shareholders due primarily to $10.6 million of special common dividends paid in 2006 and a $13.0 million decrease in
preferred share dividends paid offset by an increase in the common dividend rate in 2007.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Other than the restaurants and joint venture funding commitments described in the next paragraph and items disclosed in the Contractual Commitments
Table below, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2007 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.

We are joint venture partners in eight restaurants at Santana Row. Our investment balance in the restaurant joint
ventures was approximately $7.9 million and $8.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our equity in earnings from the restaurant joint ventures was $2.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

We have a joint venture arrangement with affiliates of Clarion Lion Properties Fund (“Clarion”), a discretionary fund created and
advised by ING Clarion Partners. We own 30% of the equity in the partnership, and Clarion owns 70%. We are the manager of the Partnership and its properties, earning fees for acquisitions, management, leasing, and financing. We also have the
opportunity to receive performance-based earnings through our Partnership interest. We account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method. In total, at December 31, 2007, the Partnership had $81.5 million of mortgage notes
outstanding.

Contractual Commitments

The following
table provides a summary of our fixed, noncancelable obligations as of December 31, 2007:

In addition to the amounts set forth in the table above, the following potential commitments exist:

(a) Under the terms of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement, from and after January 1, 1986, an unaffiliated third party has the right to
require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between



one-half to all of its 29.47% interest in Congressional Plaza at the interest’s then-current fair market value. Based on management’s current
estimate of fair market value as of December 31, 2007, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $46 million to $51 million.

(b) Under the terms of one other partnership which owns a project in southern California, if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the
property owned by the partnership, the other partner may require us to purchase their partnership interest at a formula price based upon property operating income. The purchase price for the partnership will be paid using our common shares or,
subject to certain conditions, cash. If the other partner does not redeem their interest, we may choose to purchase the limited partnership interest upon the same terms.

(c) Street Retail San Antonio LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust, entered into a Development Agreement (the “Agreement”) in 2000 with the City of San Antonio, Texas (the “City”) related to
the redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along Houston Street. Under the Agreement, we are required to issue an annual letter of credit, commencing on October 1, 2002 and ending on September 30, 2014, that covers our designated
portion of the debt service should the incremental tax revenue generated in the Zone not cover the debt service. We posted a letter of credit with the City on September 25, 2002 for $0.8 million, and the letter of credit remains outstanding. As
of December 31, 2007, we have funded approximately $1.3 million related to this obligation. In anticipation of further shortfalls of incremental tax revenues to the City, we have accrued approximately $0.3 million as of
December 31, 2007 to cover additional payments we may be obligated to make as part of the project costs.

(d) Under the terms of
various other partnership agreements for entities, the partners have the right to exchange their operating units for cash or the same number of our common shares, at our option. As of December 31, 2007, a total of 380,938 operating units are
outstanding.

(e) In addition to our contractual obligations, we have other short-term liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal
recurring operating expenses, regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt), recurring corporate expenditures including compensation agreements, non-recurring corporate expenditures (such as
tenant improvements and redevelopments) and dividends to common and preferred shareholders. Overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing
and cost of future phases of existing properties, including Santana Row and Assembly Square.

(f) At December 31, 2007, we had letters
of credit outstanding of approximately $10.6 million. The majority of these letters of credit are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the Trust.



Debt Financing Arrangements

The following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2007:

(1)

Mortgage loans do not include our 30% share ($24.5 million) of the $81.5 million debt of the partnership with Clarion Lion Properties Fund.

(2)

The stated interest rate represents the weighted average interest rate for two mortgage loans secured by this property. The loan balance represents an interest-only note of $4.35
million at a stated rate of 6.18% and the remaining balance at a stated rate of 5.96%.



(3)

The Trust acquired control of Melville Mall through a 20-year master lease and secondary financing. Because the Trust controls this property and retains substantially all of the
economic benefit and risk associated with it, this property is consolidated and the mortgage loan is reflected on the balance sheet, though it is not a legal obligation of the Trust.

(4)

The interest rate is fixed at 5.66% for the first ten years and then will be reset to a market rate in 2013. The lender has the option to call the loan on April 15, 2013 or any
time thereafter.

(5)

The term note offers a one-year extension option. The weighted average effective interest rate, before amortization of debt fees, was 5.27% for the period from November 9, 2007
through December 31, 2007.

(6)

The revolving credit facility offers a one-year extension option. The maximum amount drawn under the facility during 2007 was $244.0 million. The weighted average effective
interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility, before amortization of debt fees, was 5.63% for the year ended December 31, 2007.

(7)

The bonds require monthly interest only payments through maturity. The bonds bear interest at a variable rate determined weekly, which would enable the bonds to be remarketed at
100% of their principal amount. The property is not encumbered by a lien.

(8)

Beginning on August 15, 2008, the debentures are redeemable by the holders thereof at the original purchase price of $1,000 per debenture.

Our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. As of December 31, 2007,
we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants. If we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and, if the
debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. Many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under
those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations. As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse
effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.

Below are the
aggregate principal payments required as of December 31, 2007 under our debt financing arrangements by year. Scheduled principal installments and amounts due at maturity are included.

Our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur.

(1)

Includes $200 million outstanding on our term note which is subject to a one-year extension at our option.

(2)

Our $300 million four-year revolving credit facility is subject to a one-year extension at our option. As of December 31, 2007, there is $0 drawn under this credit facility.

(3)

Includes the Mount Vernon projected mortgage loan balance of $10.0 million as of April 15, 2013 that may be required to be paid on or after April 15, 2013. Amount also
includes $50 million of unsecured debt that may be called by the holders beginning August 15, 2008.

(4)

Total debt maturities differs from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to unamortized discounts and premiums as of December 31, 2007.



Interest Rate Hedging

As of December 31, 2007, we have no outstanding hedging instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks that qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” We generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. We do not purchase
derivatives for speculation. Our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value. The effective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects
earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected. We assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Hedge ineffectiveness did
not have a significant impact on earnings in 2007, 2006 and 2005, and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future.

In August
2002, in anticipation of a $150 million senior unsecured note offering, we entered into a treasury lock that fixed the five year treasury rate at 3.472% through August 19, 2002. On August 16, 2002, we priced the senior unsecured notes with
a scheduled closing date of August 21, 2002 and closed on the associated rate lock. Five-year treasury rates declined between the pricing period and the settlement of the rate lock and therefore, we paid $1.5 million to settle the rate lock. As
a result of the August 19, 2002 fire at Santana Row, we did not proceed with the note offering at that time. However, we consummated a $150 million, 6.125% Senior Unsecured Note offering on November 2002, and thus, the hedge loss was amortized
into interest expense over the life of these notes which matured on November 15, 2007.

REIT Qualification

We intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT under Section 856(c) of the Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on
income we distribute to generally our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the Code, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders.

Funds From Operations

Funds from operations (“FFO”) is a
supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with the U.S.
GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains on the sale of real estate. We compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and we have historically reported our FFO available for
common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. It should be noted that FFO:

•

does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other
events in the determination of net income);

•

should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and

•

is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.

We consider FFO available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it
excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of GAAP and the recording of depreciation. We use FFO primarily as one of several means of assessing our
operating performance in comparison with other REITs. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used
by such REITs.



An increase or decrease in FFO available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease
in aggregate distributions because our Board of Trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain REIT status. However, we must generally distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income to remain
qualified as a REIT. Therefore, a significant increase in FFO will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis.

The reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows:



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our use of financial instruments,
such as debt instruments, subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows, as well as the fair value of our assets. Market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices. We
manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating, investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments, dividends to common and preferred shareholders, investments,
capital expenditures and other cash requirements.

As of December 31, 2007, we were not party to any open derivative financial instruments. We may
enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk. We use interest rate protection and swap agreements, for example, to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis or to hedge
anticipated financing transactions. We use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

The following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on
interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt, including our fixed-rate debt. Interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. Quoted market
prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to
estimate the fair value of financial instruments. This analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt, such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of
economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change. This analysis assumes no change in our financial structure.

Fixed Interest Rate Debt

The majority of our outstanding debt obligations (maturing at various times through 2031 or through 2106 including
capital lease obligations) have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates. However, interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2007 we had $1.4 billion
of fixed-rate debt outstanding. If interest rates on our fixed-rate debt instruments at December 31, 2007 had been 1.0% higher, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately $70.1 million. If
interest rates on our fixed-rate debt instruments at December 31, 2007 had been 1.0% lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately $71.0 million.

Variable Interest Rate Debt

We believe that our primary interest
rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2007, we had $209.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding. Based upon this amount of variable rate debt, if interest rates increased by 1.0% our
annual interest expense would increase by approximately $2.1 million, and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately $2.1 million. Conversely, if interest rates decreased by 1.0%, our annual interest expense would
decrease by approximately $2.1 million, and our net income and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately $2.1 million.

TROLS

AND PROCEDURES

Quarterly Assessment

We carried out an assessment as of December 31, 2007 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal
control over financial reporting. This assessment was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the
conclusions of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and the conclusions of our management about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Certifications

Included as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forms of “Certification” of our principal executive officer and our
principal financial officer. The forms of Certification are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K that you currently are reading is the information
concerning the assessment referred to in the Section 302 certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Rules
adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, and effected by our employees, including management and our Board of Trustees, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This process includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets in reasonable detail;



•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorization procedures we have established; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of any of our assets in circumstances that
could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating our control system, management recognized that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, that may affect our operation have been or
will be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts
of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management’s override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time, or the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Scope of the Evaluations

The evaluation by our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of procedures and our internal audit, as well as discussions with our Disclosure Committee,
independent public accountants and others in our organization, as appropriate. In conducting this evaluation, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework.

In the course of the evaluation, we sought to identify data errors, control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action, including process improvements, were being undertaken.
The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis, so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

Our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our
Accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over
financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary. Our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated (including with improvements and
corrections) as conditions warrant. Among other matters, we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting, or
whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting. This information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the Section 302
certifications require that our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer disclose that information to the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees and our



independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board’s Auditing Standard No. 5, a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet
important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting. A “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A “material weakness” is defined in Auditing Standard No. 5 as a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation, and in any case in which a problem was identified, we considered what revision, improvement and/or correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our on-going procedures.

Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recent
fiscal year. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of our most recent fiscal year.

Management Assessment Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Federal Realty is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Establishing and maintaining internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, and effected by our employees, including
management and our Board of Trustees, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
This process includes policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets in reasonable detail;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorization procedures we have established; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of any of our assets in circumstances that
could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating our control system, management recognized that any control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, that may affect our operation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management’s override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, based on
those criteria, as of December 31, 2007.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Trustees and Shareholders of Federal Realty Investment Trust

We have audited
Federal Realty Investment Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) and subsidiaries’ (the Trust) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Federal Realty Investment Trust’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Assessment Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Federal Realty
Investment Trust’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Federal Realty Investment Trust and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by COSO

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Federal Realty Investment Trust and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 and our report dated February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Trustees and Shareholders of Federal Realty Investment Trust

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Federal Realty Investment Trust (a Maryland real estate investment trust) and subsidiaries (the Trust) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits of the basic financial statements included the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a) (1) and (2). These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Trust’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Trust adopted SFAS
No. 123R “

Share-Based Payment”

, effective January 1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion.

NOTE 1.
  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business and Organization

Federal Realty Investment Trust (the “Trust”) is an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership, management, development and redevelopment of retail and mixed-use properties. Our
properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States, as well as in California.

We operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a real estate investment trust (or REIT) for federal income tax purposes. A REIT that distributes at least 90%
of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Therefore, federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income have been
and are generally expected to be immaterial. We are obligated to pay state taxes, generally consisting of franchise or gross receipts taxes in certain states. Such state taxes also have not been material.

We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, which we refer to as a TRS. In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business
and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. The sales of condominiums at Santana Row, which
occurred between August 2005 and August 2006, and the sales of Bath Shopping Center, Key Road Plaza and Riverside Plaza in 2007 were conducted through a TRS. Other than these sales, our TRS activities have not been material.

Principles of Consolidation and Estimates

Our consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Trust, its corporate subsidiaries, and all entities in which the Trust has a controlling interest or has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The equity interests of
other investors are reflected as minority interests. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. We account for our interests in joint ventures, which we do not control or manage, using the equity method
of accounting.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
referred to as “GAAP,” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses.
These estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past, current and expected events and economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts in the 2007
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

In June 2006, we sold Greenlawn Plaza to our
unconsolidated real estate partnership resulting in a gain of $7.4 million. In our 2006 Form 10-K, the operations of the property prior to June 2006 and the gain on sale of real estate were included in discontinued operations. However, due to our
continuing involvement in the property, Greenlawn Plaza does not qualify for discontinued operations classification under SFAS No.144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Accordingly, we have reclassified the
results of

F-9


operations through the date of sale to continuing operations and reclassified the gain on sale from “discontinued operations—gain on sale of real
estate” to “gain on sale of real estate.” This reclassification did not impact net income.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times
during the term of the lease. Base rents are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease, net of valuation adjustments, based on management’s assessment of credit, collection
and other business risk. Percentage rents, which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants, are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved
and the percentage rents are collectible. Real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred. We make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts
receivable related to minimum rents, straight-line rents, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income. In some cases, primarily relating to straight-line rents, the collection of these amounts extends beyond one year. Our experience relative
to unbilled straight-line rents is that a certain portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications, bankruptcies and other factors.
Accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably
assured. If our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straight-line revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized, the additional straight-line rental income is recognized as revenue. If our evaluation
of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straight-line rental income is no longer collectible, a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, accounts receivable include approximately $32.0
million and $24.8 million, respectively, related to straight-line rents. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $7.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively.

Real Estate

Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and
depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over
the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the undepreciated balance of any tenant improvements are written off if they are
replaced. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, depreciation expense was $93.4 million, $85.7 million and $77.9 million, respectively, which includes depreciation expense for assets under capital lease obligations.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” sales are recognized at
closing only when sufficient down payments have been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and we have no significant continuing involvement. The application of SFAS No. 66 can be complex and
requires us to make assumptions. We believe the criteria of SFAS No. 66 was met for all real estate sold during 2007, 2006 and 2005.

In accordance
with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” our methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values, replacement cost and appraised values. When we acquire
operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated to land and buildings, intangibles such as in-place leases and to current assets and liabilities acquired, if any. The value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related
lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income.

F-10


We are the lessee of certain land and buildings. We classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital
leases in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.”

In accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for
Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” we capitalize certain costs related to the development and redevelopment of real estate including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, construction costs and
salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved. Additionally, in accordance with SFAS No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Costs,” we capitalize interest costs related to development and redevelopment activities.
Capitalization of these costs begin when the activities and related expenditures commence and cease when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use at which time the project is placed-in service and depreciation commences.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we review for impairment on a property
by property basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written-down to fair value. Properties held for sale are
recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell. SFAS No. 144 also requires the sale or disposal of a “component of an entity” to be treated as discontinued operations. The properties sold
by us typically meet the definition of a component of an entity and as such the revenues and expenses associated with sold properties are reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We define cash and cash equivalents as
cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short term liquid investments with an initial maturity under three months. Cash balances in individual banks may exceed insurable amounts.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets

Prepaid expenses and other assets
consist primarily of lease costs, prepaid property taxes and acquired above market leases. Capitalized lease costs are direct costs incurred which were essential to originate a lease and would not have been incurred had the leasing transaction not
taken place and include third party commissions and salaries and related costs of personnel directly related to time spent obtaining a lease. Capitalized lease costs are amortized over the life of the related lease. If a tenant vacates its space
prior to the contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any lease costs are written off. Other assets also include the premiums paid for split dollar life insurance covering several officers and former officers which were
approximately $4.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Debt Issuance Costs

Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are capitalized and are amortized as interest expense over the estimated life of the related issue using the straight-line method which approximates the effective
interest method.

Derivative Instruments

We enter into
interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks that qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” We generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to
variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. We do not purchase derivatives for speculation. Our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value. The effective portion of
changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recognized in
earnings in the period affected. We

F-11


assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future.

In January 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap
to fix the LIBOR portion of our $150 million term loan issued in October 2003. This swap fixed the LIBOR portion at 2.401% through October 2006. The full notional amount of this swap qualified as a cash flow hedge until we repaid the $150 million
term loan on July 17, 2006. We did not redesignate this swap and the related $1.2 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income was recognized into earnings.

In August 2002, in anticipation of a $150 million senior unsecured note offering, we entered into a treasury lock that fixed the five year treasury rate at 3.472% through August 19, 2002. On August 16, 2002,
we priced the senior unsecured notes with a scheduled closing date of August 21, 2002 and closed on the associated rate lock. Five-year treasury rates declined between the pricing period and the settlement of the rate lock and therefore, we
paid $1.5 million to settle the rate lock. As a result of the August 19, 2002 fire at Santana Row, we did not proceed with the note offering at that time. However, we consummated a $150 million, 6.125% Senior Unsecured Note offering in November
2002, and thus, the hedge loss was amortized into interest expense over the life of these notes through maturity on November 15, 2007.

We also
purchased an interest rate swap that terminated March 2006, with a notional amount of $40.5 million upon issuance of our 6.99% Medium Term Notes, which reduced the effective interest rate from 6.99% to 6.894%.

Acquisition, Development and Construction Loan Arrangements

We have
made certain mortgage loans that, because of their nature, qualify as loan receivables. At the time the loans were made, we did not intend for the arrangement to be anything other than a financing and did not contemplate a real estate investment.
Using guidance set forth in the Third Notice to Practitioners issued by the AICPA in February 1986 entitled “ADC Arrangements” (“the Third Notice”), we evaluate each investment to determine whether the loan arrangement
qualifies under the Third Notice as a loan, joint venture or real estate investment and the appropriate accounting thereon. Such determination affects our balance sheet classification of these investments and the recognition of interest income
derived therefrom. Generally, we receive additional interest on these loans, however we never receive in excess of 50% of the residual profit in the project (as defined in the Third Notice) and because the borrower has either a substantial
investment in the project or has guaranteed all or a portion of our loan (or a combination thereof) the loans qualify for loan accounting. The amounts under ADC arrangements are presented as mortgage notes receivable at December 31, 2007 and
2006.

Share Based Compensation

Prior to
January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principle Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Under APB No. 25, no stock based compensation costs were recognized in the Statement of Operations for stock options as our options granted
had an exercise price equal to the market value of our common shares on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” using the
modified-prospective-transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized beginning January 1, 2006 includes: (a) compensation costs for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of
January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Prior to January 1, 2006, we used the Black-Scholes model to value stock options and we continue to use this model to value stock options issued
subsequent to January 1, 2006.

F-12


On January 1, 2006, we recorded the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). This cumulative effect
resulted in decreasing accrued liabilities by $3.3 million and increasing shareholders’ equity by $3.3 million. These balance sheet changes related to deferred compensation on unvested shares. Under SFAS No. 123(R), deferred compensation
is no longer recorded at the time unvested shares are issued. Share-based compensation expense is now recorded over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to equity (generally additional paid-in capital).

If we had not adopted SFAS No. 123(R), our net income for 2006 would have excluded share-based compensation related to options of $1.3 million and included variable
stock compensation related to our performance shares of $1.5 million. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the compensation associated with our unvested performance shares is now fixed at their grant-date fair value. Accordingly, if we had not adopted SFAS
No. 123(R), our income from continuing operations, net income, basic earnings per share and dilutive earnings per share for 2006 would not have been materially different. While there are certain differences between SFAS No. 123 and 123(R),
we believe the pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123 presented below approximate the effect of SFAS No. 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to our stock based compensation, prior to January 1,
2006.

Redemption of Preferred Stock

On November 27, 2006, we redeemed our $135 million 8.5% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at their face value. The original issuance costs of
$4.8 million were charged to shareholders’ equity when the shares were issued. On July 31, 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force provided clarification on the treatment of the difference between the redemption value and the carrying
value, adjusting for issuance costs, for GAAP financial reporting. As a result, our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects a charge of $4.8 million in “Preferred stock redemption costs”
as a reduction of net income in computing net income available for common shareholders.

Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (“FIN 46-R”),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” FIN 46-R clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, for certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest (“variable interest entities”). Variable interest
entities within the scope of FIN 46-R are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to

F-13


be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected returns, or both. We have evaluated the
applicability of FIN 46-R to our investments in certain restaurant joint ventures and our real estate partnership with affiliates of Clarion Lion Properties Fund and determined that these joint ventures do not meet the requirements of a variable
interest entity and, therefore, consolidation of these ventures is not required. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. We have also evaluated the applicability of FIN 46-R to our mortgage loans receivable and determined that
they are not variable interest entities.

Our investment balance in these restaurant joint ventures was approximately $7.9 million and $8.6 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our equity in earnings from these restaurant joint ventures was $2.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our investment balances and earnings from mortgage notes
receivable and our real estate partnership are presented in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations.

From
December 29, 2005 to June 5, 2006, a third party intermediary was the legal owner of Crow Canyon Commons, but we controlled the property and retained all of the economic benefit and risk associated with the property. Accordingly, we
consolidated the property and its operations beginning December 29, 2005.

On October 16, 2006, we acquired the leasehold interest in Melville
Mall under a 20 year master lease. Additionally, we loaned the owner of Melville Mall $34.2 million secured by a second mortgage on the property. We have an option to purchase the shopping center on or after October 16, 2021 for a price of $5.0
million plus the assumption of the first mortgage and repayment of the second mortgage. We have determined that this property is held in a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, beginning October 16,
2006, we consolidated this property and its operations.

From May 30, 2007 to October 11, 2007, a third party intermediary was the legal owner of
Shoppers’ World, but we controlled the property and retained all of the economic benefit and risk associated with the property. Accordingly, we consolidated the property and its operations beginning May 30, 2007.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows – Supplemental Disclosures

The following table provides additional information related to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

Accounting for Income Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
FIN 48 was issued to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of recognition, disclosure and measurement related to accounting for uncertain income tax positions. We adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The adoption
of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We recognize penalties and interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. With few exceptions, we are no longer
subject to U.S. federal, state, and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003. As of December 31, 2007, we had no material unrecognized tax benefits.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value
Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, except for share-based payments under SFAS No. 123(R). We are required to adopt the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 157 for
financial assets and financial liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are re-measured at least annually effective January 1, 2008; we are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 157 for all other
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective January 1, 2009. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after November 15,
2007. We do not intend to make this fair value election and, therefore, we do not expect SFAS No. 159 to have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141 (R)”) and Statement No. 160
“

Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51”

(“SFAS No. 160”). The new standards significantly change the accounting and reporting of business
combination transactions and minority interests in the consolidated financial statements; these changes include expensing all acquisition related transaction costs, recognizing contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair
values with subsequent changes generally reflected in earnings, recognizing 100% of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions of less than 100% controlling interest and recognizing a non-controlling interest as
equity in the consolidated financial statements. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 141 (R) for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009 and SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009. We are
currently evaluating the impact SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

NOTE 2.   REAL ESTATE

A summary of our real estate investments and related encumbrances is as follows:

Retail and mixed-use properties includes the residential portion of Santana Row. The residential property
investments are comprised of our investments in Rollingwood Apartments and Crest Apartments at Congressional Plaza.

A
summary of our significant acquisitions in 2007 and 2006 is as follows:

F-16


(1)

Approximately $0.4 million and $1.8 million of the net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for “above market leases” and liabilities for “below market
leases,” respectively.

(2)

The White Marsh Portfolio was purchased using $11.5 million of cash plus a combination of common stock and convertible preferred stock, downREIT operating partnership units, and the
assumption of mortgage loans through a merger with Nottingham Properties, Inc. The acquisition also included ground leases covering 50,000 square feet of office space and a hotel which are not included in gross leasable area.

(3)

Approximately $3.6 million and $9.3 million of the net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for “above market leases” and liabilities for “below market
leases,” respectively.

(4)

Approximately $0.8 million and $2.1 million of the net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for “above market leases” and liabilities for “below market
leases,” respectively.

(5)

On October 26, 2007, we completed an exchange transaction whereby we sold our leasehold interests in six New Jersey properties and acquired the fee interests in Mid-Pike Plaza
and Huntington Shopping Center. Prior to the transaction, we held leasehold interests in all eight properties. The transaction was completed as a 1031 tax-deferred exchange and involved a cash payment of $17.2 million. All eight properties were
previously encumbered by capital lease obligations which were extinguished as part of the transaction.

(6)

We acquired an additional 30,000 square feet of gross leasable area in 2007.

(7)

The Trust controls and consolidates Melville Mall at its approximate fair value of $60.0 million. We gained control of Melville Mall through a 20-year master lease and $34.1 million
secondary financing to the owner. The master lease includes a purchase option in 2021 for $5.0 million plus the assumption of the owner’s first mortgage that has a balance of $25.1 million at December 31, 2007.

On November 16, 2007, we purchased the 10% minority interest in three properties located at our Fifth Avenue, Hermosa Avenue and Third Street Promenade projects for
$5.7 million. We now own 100% of these properties.

A summary of our significant dispositions in 2007 and 2006 is as
follows:

F-17


(1)

Gain of $0.6 million is net of $0.3 million in taxes.

(2)

Gain of $0.4 million is net of $0.1 million in taxes.

(3)

Gain of $0.5 million is net of $0.1 million in taxes.

(4)

We sold two of three retail buildings located in Forest Hills, NY.

(5)

On October 26, 2007, we completed an exchange transaction whereby we sold our leasehold interests in six New Jersey properties and acquired the fee interests in Mid-Pike Plaza
and Huntington Shopping Center. The transaction was completed as a 1031 tax-deferred exchange and involved a cash payment of $17.2 million. All eight properties were previously encumbered by capital lease obligations which were extinguished as part
of the transaction.

(6)

As of August 25, 2006, we had sold all of the 219 condominium units we planned to sell at Santana Row.

(7)

Gain of $16.5 million is net of $2.4 million in taxes.

(8)

This property was contributed to our real estate partnership in which we own a 30% interest. Accordingly, we recognized a partial gain of $7.4 million on this sale related to the
70% equity interest contributed.

NOTE 3.   MORTGAGE NOTES RECEIVABLE

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had mortgage notes receivable with an aggregate carrying amount of $40.6 million and $40.8 million, respectively, which are
net of a valuation allowance of $4.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These mortgage notes are due over various terms from August 2016 to May 2021. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our mortgages had a weighted average interest rate of
10.0%. Interest income is accrued as earned. Under the terms of certain of these mortgages, we receive additional interest based upon the gross income of the secured properties and, upon sale of the properties, we will share in the appreciation of
the properties.

On August 4, 2006, we amended the $17.7 million second mortgage note receivable which is secured by a hotel in San Jose, California.
The amended note decreased the interest rate from 14% to 9% per annum, requires monthly payments of principal and interest based on a 15-year amortization schedule and matures on August 20, 2016.

NOTE 4.   REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIP

We have a joint venture
arrangement (“the Partnership”) with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ING Clarion Partners. We own 30% of the equity in the Partnership, and Clarion owns 70%. We are the manager of the Partnership and its
properties, earning fees for acquisitions, management, leasing, and financing. We also have the opportunity to receive performance-based earnings through our Partnership interest. As of December 31, 2007, we have made total contributions of
$34.8 million and received total distributions of $4.4 million. We account for our interest in the Partnership using the equity method.

The following are the summarized operating results and the financial position of the Partnership:

F-18


For mortgages payable totaling $36.7 million that are secured by three properties owned by subsidiaries of the
Partnership, we were the guarantor for the obligations of the joint venture which are commonly referred to as “non-recourse carve-outs.” The guarantees do not have a finite term; however, once the lenders have been repaid in accordance
with the loan documents, the only likely basis for a claim on the guarantee is for loss to the lender as a result of potential future environmental liability at the properties to which the loans relate. We were not guaranteeing repayment of the debt
itself. The Partnership would indemnify us for any loss we were to incur under these guarantees. As of November 2007, we are no longer the guarantor on the loans.

The following table provides a summary of acquisitions made by our unconsolidated real estate partnership in 2007 and 2006:

(1)

The property acquired is adjacent to and operated as part of Barcroft Plaza which is also owned by the Partnership.

(2)

This property was acquired from the Trust.

On April 10, 2007, our
unconsolidated real estate partnership entered into a mortgage note for approximately $4.2 million. The mortgage note is secured by the Lake Barcroft property, which was acquired in February 2007, and by Barcroft Plaza. The Lake Barcroft property is
adjacent to and operated as part of Barcroft Plaza. The note matures on July 1, 2016, bears interest at 5.71% per annum and requires monthly payments of interest only.

F-19


NOTE 5.   ACQUIRED IN-PLACE LEASES

Acquired above market leases are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and had a balance of $17.6 million and $16.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and accumulated amortization of
$4.7 million and $2.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Acquired below market leases are included in other liabilities and deferred credits and had a balance of $46.0 million and $41.4 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively, and accumulated amortization of $13.3 million and $8.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as additional rental
income for below market leases or a reduction of rental income for above market leases in the statement of operations. Rental income included net amortization from acquired in-place leases of $2.9 million, $2.5 million and $1.6 million in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The remaining weighted-average amortization period as of December 31, 2007, is 9.8 years and 13.4 years for above market leases and below market leases, respectively.

The amortization for acquired in-place leases during the next five years and thereafter, assuming no early lease terminations, is as follows:

F-20


NOTE 6.  DEBT

The following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:

F-21


In connection with the acquisition of the White Marsh portfolio and Shoppers’ World, we assumed five mortgage notes
as follows:

(1)

The aggregate face amount of the mortgage notes is $79.7 million. However, in accordance with GAAP, these mortgage notes were recorded at their fair value of $80.0 million.

With the exception of one of the mortgage notes on White Marsh Plaza, all of the mortgage notes assumed require monthly payments of
principal and interest. The $4.5 million mortgage note on White Marsh Plaza is interest only through the maturity date.

On October 26, 2007, we
acquired the fee interest in Mid-Pike Plaza and Huntington Shopping Center and sold our leasehold interest in six properties, Allwood, Blue Star, Brunswick, Clifton, Hamilton and Rutgers Shopping Centers. Prior to the transaction, we had capital
lease obligations totaling $76.4 million on all eight properties. The capital lease obligations were extinguished as part of the transaction. The capital lease obligations for the six properties sold are included in “capital lease obligations
of assets held for sale” on the balance sheet.

On November 9, 2007, we entered into a $200 million unsecured term loan bearing interest at LIBOR
plus 57.5 basis points. The loan matures on November 6, 2008, subject to a one-year extension at our option and is prepayable without penalty. The spread over LIBOR is subject to adjustment based on our credit rating. The loan had a weighted
average interest rate of 5.3% for 2007.

On November 15, 2007, we repaid our 6.125% senior notes with a principal amount of $150.0 million. These
notes were repaid with funds borrowed on our $200 million unsecured term loan.

The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our $300 million
revolving credit facility during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $244.0 million, $297.0 million and $159.7 million, respectively. The weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was $154.3 million, $106.0 million and $105.1 million for 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Our revolving credit facility had a weighted average interest rate, before amortization of debt fees, of 5.6%, 5.6% and 3.7% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, we are required to pay an annual facility fee of
$0.5 million. The loan matures on July 27, 2010, subject to a one-year extension at our option.

Our credit facility and certain notes require us to
comply with various financial covenants, including the maintenance of minimum shareholder’s equity and debt coverage ratios and a maximum ratio of debt to net worth. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all loan covenants.

F-22


Scheduled principal payments on mortgage loans, notes payable, senior notes and debentures as of December 31, 2007
are as follows:

(1)

Includes $200 million outstanding on our term note which is subject to a one-year extension at our option.

(2)

Our $300 million four-year revolving credit facility is subject to a one-year extension at our option. As of December 31, 2007, there is $0 drawn under this credit facility.

(3)

Includes the Mount Vernon projected mortgage loan balance of $10.0 million as of April 15, 2013 that may be required to be paid on or after April 15, 2013. Amount also
includes $50 million of unsecured debt that may be called by the holders beginning August 15, 2008.

The total debt maturities differs from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized discount or premium on certain senior notes, debentures and
mortgage payables.

Future minimum lease payments and their present value for property under capital leases as of December 31, 2007, are
as follows:

Certain of our capital lease obligations required payments based on the performance of the related properties in
addition to the minimum payment amounts set forth above. The additional performance based payments were $4.1 million, $5.6 million and $4.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively and is included in “discontinued
operations–income.” All capital leases with performance based payments were extinguished in October 2007.

NOTE 7.  FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Except as disclosed below, the carrying amount of our financial instruments approximates their fair value. The fair value of our
mortgages payable, notes payable, and senior notes and debentures is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. Quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow
analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and

F-23


notes payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. The estimates of fair value presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments. A summary of the carrying amount and fair value of our mortgages payable, notes payable and senior notes and debentures is as follows:

NOTE 8.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are currently a party to various legal proceedings. Other than as described below, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters, either individually or
in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations; however, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Also under our leases, tenants are typically obligated to
indemnify us from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses imposed upon or asserted against us (1) as owner of the properties due to certain matters relating to the operation of the properties by the tenant, and (2) where
appropriate, due to certain matters relating to the ownership of the properties prior to their acquisition by us.

We are involved in a litigation matter
relating to a shopping center in New Jersey where a former tenant has alleged that we and our management agent acted improperly by failing to disclose a condemnation action at the property that was pending when the lease was signed. A trial as to
liability only has been concluded and post-trial briefs have been filed, but no decision has been rendered. One of the plaintiffs in the matter has filed for bankruptcy protection and as a result, the judge in our case has stayed further proceedings
in the case. If we are found liable once the stay has been lifted, a trial will be held to determine the amount of damages. Based on the information available to us, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we will be found liable. If a
verdict is rendered against us, we may seek indemnification from the third party management company that negotiated the lease on our behalf. We cannot assess with any certainty at this time the potential damages for which we would be liable if a
verdict is rendered against us or the potential amounts we might recover against the third party management company; however, if a verdict is rendered against us, there may be a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in which it
becomes both probable that we will have to pay the damages and such damages can be reasonably estimated. In any event, management does not believe it will have a material impact on our financial position.

We also have one litigation matter filed against us in May 2003 which alleges that a one page document entitled “Final Proposal,” which included language that
it was subject to approval of formal documentation, constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our Santana Row property and gave the plaintiff the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in
accordance with a formula included in the “Final Proposal.” A trial as to liability only was held in June 2006 and a jury rendered a verdict against us. A trial on the issue of damages has been set for April 2008. The complaint did not
specify the amount of damages claimed. We have now received reports from our experts and the plaintiff’s experts which show potential damages ranging from $600,000 to $24 million. We cannot make a reasonable estimate of potential damages until
discovery is completed on the damages issue and the court rules on various legal issues impacting the calculation of damages. We intend to appeal the jury verdict; however, no appeal of the judgment can be taken until the trial on damages has been
completed. If we are not successful in overturning the jury verdict, we will be liable for damages. Depending on the amount of damages awarded, it is possible there could be a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in which it
becomes both probable that we will have to pay the damages and such damages can be reasonably estimated. In any event, management does not believe it will have a material impact on our financial position.

F-24


We reserve for estimated losses, if any, associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time real estate is sold or
other potential liabilities relating to that sale, taking any insurance policies into account. These warranties may extend up to ten years and require significant judgment. Any increases to our estimated warranty losses would usually result in a
decrease in net income.

Warranty reserves for condominium units sold at Santana Row were established to cover potential costs for materials, labor and
other items associated with warranty-type claims that may arise within the ten-year statutorily mandated latent construction defect warranty period. Our warranty and latent construction defect reserves are calculated based upon historical industry
experience and current known factors. Variables used in the calculation of the warranty reserves, as well as the adequacy of the reserves based on the number of condominium units still under warranty, are reviewed on a periodic basis.

During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we became aware of certain facts and circumstances that caused us to reassess our initial reserve for damages related to
defective work done by third party contractors while upgrades were made to the units being prepared for sale. Based on current estimates, we believe the range of possible incremental cost is between $5.1 million and $9.3 million, net of taxes of
$1.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, before insurance recoveries. The full extent of damages and required repairs on any particular unit cannot be determined until we have evaluated whether there was defective work in the unit and determined
the extent of damages (if any) caused by the defective work. We are still in the process of evaluating units for potential damage arising from the defective work and, to date, have completed the repairs caused by the defective work in only a limited
number of units. The extent of the damages encountered in those units, and the resulting costs to repair, varied considerably. Accordingly, our current estimates are based on limited and varying actual costs. We are continuing our evaluation of this
matter, and in 2007, we increased our reserves by $5.1 million, net of taxes of $1.9 million, to the low end of our estimated range of potential obligation related to these particular damages. This range excludes any amounts we may recover from
insurance or the contractors responsible for the defective work. In the event that our evaluation allows us to develop a better estimate of these damages, we will adjust our estimate accordingly. This increase reduces our gain on sale of condominium
units that were sold during 2005 and 2006. The increase in the reserve is included in “Discontinued operations—gain on sale of real estate”. The reserve is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Although we consider the
reserve to be adequate, there can be no assurance that the reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to the difference between the assumptions used to estimate the reserve and actual losses.

We are self-insured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained
liability. We currently do not maintain third party stop-loss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. Our accrual for self-insurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed
and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Management considers a number of factors, including third-party actuary valuations and future increases in costs of claims, when making these determinations. If our liability costs exceed
these accruals, it will reduce our net income.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our reserves for warranties and general liability costs were
$16.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively. Any potential losses which exceed our estimates would result in a decrease in our net income. During 2007 and 2006, we made payments from these reserves of $2.4 million and $1.0 million,
respectively.

At December 31, 2007, we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately $10.6 million. The majority of these letters of credit are
collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the Trust.

Under the terms of the Congressional Plaza partnership agreement, from and after
January 1, 1986, an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between one-half to all of its 29.47% interest in Congressional Plaza at the interest’s then-current fair market
value. Based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of December 31, 2007, our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately $46 million to $51 million.

F-25


Street Retail San Antonio LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust, entered into a Development Agreement (the
“Agreement”) in 2000 with the City of San Antonio, Texas (the “City”) related to the redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along Houston Street. Under the Agreement, we are required to issue an annual letter of credit,
commencing on October 1, 2002 and ending on September 30, 2014, that covers our designated portion of the debt service should the incremental tax revenue generated in the Zone not cover the debt service. We posted a letter of credit with
the City on September 25, 2002 for $0.8 million, and the letter of credit remains outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, we have funded approximately $1.3 million related to this obligation. In anticipation of further shortfalls of
incremental tax revenues to the City, we have accrued approximately $0.3 million as of December 31, 2007 to cover additional payments we may be obligated to make as part of the project costs.

Under the terms of various other partnership agreements for entities, the partners have the right to exchange their operating units for cash or the same number of our
common shares, at our option. As of December 31, 2007, a total of 380,938 operating units are outstanding.

We have three leases in which the lessor
has a put option, which would require us to purchase the properties during the remaining lease term. If the lessor were to exercise this option in 2008, the purchase price would be approximately $44.0 million.

A master lease for Mercer Mall includes a fixed purchase price option for $55 million in 2023. If we fail to exercise our purchase option, the owner of Mercer Mall has a
put option which would require us to purchase Mercer Mall for $60 million in 2025.

A master lease for Melville Mall includes a fixed purchase price option
in 2021 for $5 million and the assumption of the owner’s debt which is $25.1 million at December 31, 2007. If we fail to exercise our purchase option, the owner of Melville Mall has a put option which would require us to purchase Melville
Mall in 2023 for $5 million and the assumption of the owner’s debt.

As of December 31, 2007 in connection with renovation and development
projects, the Trust has contractual obligations of approximately $55.1 million.

We are obligated under ground lease agreements on several shopping centers
requiring minimum annual payments as follows, as of December 31, 2007:

NOTE 9.  SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

On March 8, 2007, as part of the consideration to acquire the White Marsh portfolio, we issued (i) 884,066 common shares at $88.18 per share, par value $0.01 per share, (ii) 399,896 shares of 5.417%
Series 1 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares (“Series 1 Preferred Shares”) at the liquidation preference of $25 per share, par value $0.01 per share, and (iii) 185,504 downREIT operating partnership units at $88.18 per share. The
Series 1 Preferred Shares will accrue dividends at a rate of 5.417% per year and are convertible at any time by the holders to our common

F-26


shares at a conversion rate of $104.69 per share. The Series 1 Preferred Shares are also convertible under certain circumstances at our election. The holders
of the Series 1 Preferred Shares have no voting rights.

On December 27, 2007, we issued 2.0 million common shares at $81.21 per share, for cash
proceeds of approximately $162.4 million before other expenses of the offering. The proceeds were used on an interim basis to repay our revolving credit facility.

We have a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, whereby shareholders may use their dividends and optional cash payments to purchase shares. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, 32,615 shares, 44,077 shares and 62,579 shares, respectively, were issued under the
Plan.

NOTE 10.   DIVIDENDS

A summary of dividends declared and paid per share is as follows:

(1)

Includes a special dividend declared and paid of $0.20 resulting from the sales of condominiums at Santana Row.

(2)

On March 8, 2007, as part of the consideration to acquire the White Marsh portfolio, we issued 399,896 shares of 5.417% Series 1 Cumulative Convertible Preferred shares. The
Series 1 Preferred are paid dividends on a quarterly basis at a rate of 5.417% per year.

(3)

On November 27, 2006, the Trust redeemed all 5,400,000 outstanding shares of its Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Shares
ceased to accrue on November 27, 2006.

A summary of the income tax status of dividends per share paid
is as follows:

F-27


On October 31, 2007, the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per common share, payable
January 15, 2008 to common shareholders of record on January 2, 2008.

NOTE 11.   OPERATING LEASES

Our 82 predominantly retail shopping center and mixed use properties at December 31, 2007 are located in 12 states and the District of Columbia. There are
approximately 2,400 leases with tenants providing a wide range of retail products and services. These tenants range from sole proprietorships to national retailers; no one tenant or corporate group of tenants accounts for more than 2.5% of
annualized base rent.

Our leases with commercial property and residential tenants are classified as operating leases. Commercial property leases generally
range from three to ten years (certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer), and in addition to minimum rents, usually provide for percentage rents based on the tenant’s level of sales achieved and cost recoveries for the tenant’s
share of certain operating costs. Leases on apartments are generally for a period of one year or less.

Minimum future commercial property rentals from
noncancelable operating leases, before any reserve for uncollectible amounts and assuming no early lease terminations, at our operating properties as of December 31, 2007 are as follows:

NOTE 12.   COMPONENTS OF RENTAL INCOME AND EXPENSE

The principal components of rental income are as follows:

Minimum rents include $8.2 million, $5.7 million and $7.9 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to
recognize minimum rents on a straight-line basis. Straight-line rental income in 2005 includes the impact of changes in estimates of the collectibility of certain long-term receivables which increased straight-line rental income by $1.2 million. In
addition, minimum rents include $2.9 million, $2.5 million and $1.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to recognize income from the amortization of in-place leases in accordance with SFAS No. 141.

F-28


The principal components of rental expense are as follows:

NOTE 13.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Results of properties sold constitute discontinued operations and as such, the operations of these properties are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. A summary of the financial information
for the discontinued operations is as follows:

NOTE 14.   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

A summary of share-based compensation expense included in net income is as follows:

As of December 31, 2007, we have grants outstanding under two share-based compensation plans. In May 2007,
our shareholders approved an amendment to the 2001 Long Term Incentive Plan (“the 2001 Plan”), originally established in May 2001, which increased the authorization to grant share options, common shares and other share-based awards from
1,750,000 shares of common stock to 3,250,000 shares of common stock. Our 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘the 1993 Plan”) authorized the grant of share options, common shares and other share-based awards for up to 5,500,000 shares of
common stock. The 1993 Plan expired in May 2003.

Option awards under the 2001 Plan and the 1993 Plan are required to have an exercise price at least equal
to the closing trading price of our common shares on the date of grant. Options and share awards under these plans

F-29


generally vest over 3 to 5 years and option awards typically have a 10-year contractual term. We pay dividends on unvested shares. Certain options and share
awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control. Additionally, the vesting on certain option and share awards can accelerate in part or in full upon retirement based on the age of the retiree or upon termination without cause.

As a result of the exercise of options, we had notes outstanding from our officers and employees for $0.8 million and $1.5 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These notes bear interest at LIBOR plus a market-rate spread with the rate adjusted annually on the anniversary date. These notes are collateralized by the shares with recourse to the borrower and have
five-year terms. Option awards made in 2001 and later do not provide for employees to be able to exercise their options with a loan from the Trust.

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. Expected volatilities, term, dividend yields, employee exercises and employee terminations are primarily based on historical data. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of each share award is determined based on the closing trading price of our common shares on the grant date.

The following table provides a summary of the weighted-average assumption used to value options:

The
following table provides a summary of option activity for 2007:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $14.48 per share,
$7.97 per share and $7.01 per share, respectively. The total cash received from options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $5.1 million, $8.8 million and $10.9 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the
year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $4.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively.

F-30


The following table provides a summary of share activity for 2007:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock awarded in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $91.13, $68.18 and $51.35,
respectively. The total vesting-date fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $10.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2007, there was $12.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements (i.e. options and unvested shares) granted under our plans. This
cost is expected to be recognized over the next 4.9 years with a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.

Effective December 31, 2007, Larry Finger, our
former Chief Financial Officer, was no longer employed by the Trust. Under his existing severance agreement, his departure was treated as a termination without cause. As a result, we recognized approximately $0.6 million related to the accelerated
vesting of unvested shares and options and $0.4 million related to a cash payment to Mr. Finger. These amounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income.

On February 10, 2008, common shares and options were awarded under various incentive compensation plans as

follows:

NOTE 15.   SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLANS

We have a savings and retirement plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, employees can elect, at their
discretion, to contribute a portion of their compensation up to a maximum of $15,500, $15,000 and $14,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Under the plan, we contribute 50% of each employee’s first 5% of contributions. In addition, we may
make discretionary contributions within the limits of deductibility set forth by the Code. Our employees are immediately eligible to become plan participants. Effective as of January 1, 2005 employees are eligible to receive matching
contributions immediately on their participation, however, these matching payments will not vest until their first anniversary of employment. Our expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $365,000, $342,000
and $333,000, respectively.

A non-qualified deferred compensation plan for our officers and certain other employees was established in 1994. The plan
allows the participants to defer income until the earlier of age 65 or termination of employment. As of December 31, 2007, we are liable to participants for approximately $6.2 million under this plan. Although this is an unfunded plan, we have
purchased certain investments to match this obligation. Our obligation under this plan and the related investments are both included in the accompanying financial statements.

F-31


NOTE 16.    EARNINGS PER SHARE

We calculate basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share.” Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net
income available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised
or converted into common shares and then shared in our earnings. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, operating partnership units and Series 1 Preferred Shares were excluded from diluted EPS as the conversion of these units would have resulted in an
anti-dilutive effect.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation between basic and diluted EPS:

F-32


NOTE 17.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

We operate our portfolio of properties in two geographic operating regions: East and West, which constitute our segments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information.”

A summary of our operations by geographic region is presented below:
