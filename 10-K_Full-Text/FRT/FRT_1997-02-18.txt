  PART I & II
  -----------

  Item 1.   Business
  -------   --------


       Federal Realty Investment Trust is an owner, operator and redeveloper of
  retail properties.  Founded in 1962 as a District of Columbia business trust
  of unlimited duration, the Trust is a self-administered equity real estate
  investment trust.  The Trust consolidates the financial statements of three
  wholly owned subsidiaries, eleven partnerships and a joint venture.  At
  December 31, 1996 the Trust owned 86 retail properties and one apartment
  complex.

       The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
  estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856- 860 of the Internal Revenue
  Code.  Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 95% of its real
  estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which
  meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its
  taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  Therefore, no
  provision for Federal income taxes is required.

       An important part of the Trust's strategy is to acquire older, well-
  located  properties in prime, densely populated and affluent areas and to
  enhance their operating performance through a program of renovation,
  expansion, reconfiguration and retenanting.  The Trust's traditional focus has
  been on community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by
  supermarkets, drug stores or high volume, value oriented retailers that
  provide consumer necessities.  Late in 1994 the Trust expanded this strategy
  to include retail buildings and shopping centers in prime established main
  street shopping areas.  The Trust continually evaluates its properties for
  renovation, retenanting and expansion opportunities.  Similarly, the Trust
  regularly reviews its portfolio and from time to time considers selling
  certain of its properties.

       The Trust's portfolio of properties has doubled from 43 as of January 1,
  1992 to 87 at December 31, 1996.  During this five year period the Trust
  acquired 48 retail properties for approximately $414 million. Eleven of the
  seventeen acquisitions in 1996 were in California and two were in Florida,
  which are new markets for the Trust. During this same period four shopping
  centers were sold. Also during this period the Trust spent over $183 million
  to renovate, expand, improve and retenant its properties.  All but four of the
  acquisitions were funded primarily by cash.  Of the four properties not fully
  acquired by cash, one was acquired by means of capital and ground leases, one
  was acquired for common shares of the Trust and the assumption of a mortgage,
  one was acquired for cash and the assumption of a municipal bond issue and the
  fourth was acquired for cash with a minority investment by a third party. This
  growth was financed through borrowing and equity offerings, since each year
  the Trust has distributed all or the majority of its cash provided by
  operating activities to its shareholders.


 
      The Trust's 86 retail properties, consisting of 57 shopping centers and 29
  main street retail buildings, are located in 14 states and the District of
  Columbia, primarily along the East Coast between the Boston metropolitan area
  and Richmond, Virginia.  Nineteen of the shopping centers are located in the
  Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; eleven are in Pennsylvania, primarily in
  the Philadelphia area; nine are in New Jersey; five are in Illinois; three are
  in Virginia; three are in Massachusetts; and there is one in each of the
  following states: California, Connecticut, Georgia, Michigan, New York, North
  Carolina and Tennessee.  The main street retail buildings are located in
  California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey. No
  single property accounts for over 10% of the Trust's revenues.

       The Trust has approximately 1,800 tenants, ranging from sole proprietors
  to major national retailers; no one tenant or corporate group of tenants
  accounts for 5% or more of revenue.  The Trust's leases with these tenants are
  classified as operating leases and typically are structured to include minimum
  rents, percentage rents based on tenants' sales volumes and reimbursement of
  certain operating expenses and real estate taxes.

       The Trust is seeking to increase its pace of acquiring older, well-
  located shopping centers and retail buildings and then enhancing their revenue
  potential through a program of renovation, retenanting and remerchandising.
  The Trust is also studying sites which are suitable for the development of new
  shopping centers.  During the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994,
  retail properties have contributed 96%, 96% and 95%, respectively of the
  Trust's total revenue.

       The Trust amended its by-laws in 1996 to permit investments west of the
  Mississippi River.  Investments are not required to be based on specific
  allocation by type of property.  The extent to which the Trust might mortgage
  or otherwise finance investments varies with the investment involved and the
  economic climate.

       The success of the Trust depends upon, among other factors, the trends of
  the economy, including interest rates, construction costs, retailing trends,
  income tax laws, increases or decreases in operating expenses, governmental
  regulations, population trends, zoning laws, legislation and the ability of
  the Trust to keep its properties leased at profitable levels.  The Trust
  competes for tenants with other real estate owners and the Trust's properties
  account for only a small fraction of the retail space available for lease.
  The Trust competes for investment opportunities and debt and equity capital
  with individuals, partnerships, corporations, financial institutions, life
  insurance companies, pension funds, trust funds and other real estate
  investment trusts.

       Investments in real property create a potential for environmental
  liability on the part of the current and previous owners of, or any mortgage
  lender on, such real property.  If hazardous substances are discovered on or
  emanating from any


 
  property, the owner or operator of the property may be held liable for costs
  and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances.  Effective September 1,
  1996 the Trust obtained environmental insurance on sixty of its properties.
  Subject to certain exclusions and deductibles, the insurance provides coverage
  for unidentified, pre-existing conditions and for future contamination caused
  by tenants and third parties.

       The Trust's current policy is to obtain an environmental study on each
  property it seeks to acquire.  On recent acquisitions, any substances
  identified prior to closing which present an immediate environmental hazard
  have been or are in the process of remediation.  Costs related to the
  abatement of asbestos which increase the value of Trust properties are
  capitalized.  Other costs are expensed.  In 1996 and 1995 approximately
  $970,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, of which $540,000 and $796,000,
  respectively, was capitalized abatement costs, was spent on environmental
  matters.  The Trust has budgeted approximately $3.0 million for 1997 for
  environmental matters, a majority of which is projected for asbestos
  abatement.  (See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)


  Current Developments
  --------------------

        In 1996 the Trust acquired $105.6 million of retail property.  Three
  shopping centers were acquired: Saugus Plaza Shopping Center, located in
  metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts for $12.7 million in cash; Wynnewood
  Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for $21.8 million in
  cash; and Escondido Promenade in suburban San Diego, California for $14.2
  million in cash and the assumption of $9.4 million of municipal bonds.
  Fourteen retail buildings were acquired: two buildings in Winter Park, Florida
  for a cost of $6.8 million; two buildings in Greenwich, Connecticut for $12.7
  million; and ten buildings, located in Pasadena, Santa Monica and San Diego,
  California, for cash of $17.6 million with minority interests contributing
  another $10.4 million.

       During 1996 the Trust spent $42.2 million in renovating, expanding and
  retenanting its properties.  These improvements included $11.5 million on the
  final tenant work and construction of an additional 30,000 square feet at
  Congressional Plaza, which includes the Trust's corporate offices; $4.7
  million on the redevelopment and expansion of a portion of Bethesda Row; $3.9
  million for the renovation of Brick Plaza in Brick, New Jersey; and $2.3
  million to buy out below market leases.  In addition the Trust invested $23.4
  million in mortgage notes receivable, most of which are convertible into
  ownership interests in the properties by which they are secured.

       The Trust initially funded the majority of its 1996 acquisitions, capital
  improvement projects and investments in mortgages with borrowings under its
  revolving credit facilities with four banks.  Borrowings on these revolving
  credit facilities were then repaid from long term debt and equity issues.  In
  August 1996 the Trust issued $50.0 million of 7.48% Debentures due August 15,
  2026, netting approximately $49.8 million.  In May


 
  the Trust sold 1.8 million shares of beneficial interest ("shares") at $22 per
  share to an institutional investor, netting approximately $39.3 million. In
  December the Trust sold another 1.6 million shares to the public at $27 7/8
  per share, netting $42.9 million. Another three million shares were sold to an
  institutional investor on February 4, 1997 for $28 per share, netting $83.9
  million.

       At December 31, 1996 the Trust had 205 full-time employees.

  (1) Determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
  Statement No. 95.

  (2) Defined as income before depreciation and amortization of real estate
  assets and before extraordinary items and significant nonrecurring events less
  gains on sale of real estate. Funds from operations differs from net cash
  provided by operating activities primarily because funds from operations does
  not include changes in operating assets and liabilities. Funds from operations
  is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a
  measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a
  measure of liquidity.


 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
  Operations

  Liquidity and Capital Resources
  -------------------------------

       Federal Realty meets its liquidity requirements through net cash provided
  by operating activities, long term borrowing through debt offerings and
  mortgages, medium and short term borrowing under revolving credit facilities,
  and equity offerings. Because a significant portion of the Trust's net cash
  provided by operating activities is distributed to shareholders, capital
  outlays for property acquisitions, renovation projects and debt repayments
  require funding from borrowing or equity offerings.

       Operating activities generated $65.6 million in 1996, $65.1 million in
  1995 and $45.2 million in 1994 of which $52.1 million, $47.9 million and
  $44.0 million, respectively, was distributed to shareholders. Despite a $5.6
  million increase in net income in 1996 over 1995 and a $3.4 million increase
  in non-cash charges such as depreciation in 1996 over 1995, net cash provided
  by operating activities increased only $500,000 because these increases to
  cash were offset by an increased usage of $8.5 million in 1996 over 1995 for
  other operating purposes, primarily increases in accounts receivable, prepaid
  expenses and decreases in accrued expenses. Cash generated from operating
  activities was $19.9 million greater in 1995 than in 1994.  The increase of
  $2.6 million in net income and an increase of $4.4 million in non-cash charges
  such as depreciation were augmented by a decreased usage of $12.9 million in
  other operating activities, primarily due to increases in accounts payable and
  accrued expenses.

       During the three year period 1994 through 1996, the Trust expended over
  $357 million in cash to acquire properties and to improve its properties. In
  addition, in 1996 the Trust invested $23.4 million in mortgage notes
  receivable, most of which are convertible into ownership interests in the
  properties by which they are secured. At December 31, 1996 the Trust had
  deposits of $23.4 million on real estate, primarily for the purchase in
  January 1997 of the fee interest on four properties which it held subject to
  capital leases. These expenditures were primarily funded from the proceeds of
  various debt and equity transactions.

       The Trust is actively expanding its acquisition efforts. In 1996 the
  Trust amended its bylaws to permit investments west of the Mississippi River.
  The Trust acquired $105.6 million of retail property in 1996, comprised of
  three shopping centers and fourteen retail buildings. With certain of these
  purchases the Trust made its first acquisitions in Florida and California. On
  October 1, the Trust acquired Saugus Plaza Shopping Center, located in
  metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts for $12.7 million in cash. On October 29,
  1996 Wynnewood Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was
  purchased for a total cash cost of $21.8 million. On December 31, 1996 the
  Trust acquired the controlling interest in a Limited Liability Company formed
  to own Escondido Promenade in suburban San Diego, California for $14.2 million
  in cash. The $23.5 million center is encumbered by $9.4 million of municipal
  bonds. The bonds, which mature October 1, 2016, bear interest at a variable
  rate determined weekly to be the interest rate which would enable


 
  the bonds to be remarketed at 100% of their principal amount. The bonds are
  redeemable on demand by the holders and if they cannot be resold, will be due.
  The other member of the Limited Liability Company, who is related to the
  developer of the property, has a minor interest in the profits of the company.

       On February 28, 1996 the Trust purchased, for cash, two retail buildings
  in Winter Park, Florida for a cost of $6.8 million. In 1996 the Trust
  purchased two buildings in Greenwich, Connecticut, one for $3.2 million in
  cash on May 6 and another for $9.5 million in cash on June 4. On December 31,
  1996 the Trust made an investment of $17.6 million for the general partnership
  interest in two partnerships (the "CIM partnerships"), one of which owns ten
  main street retail buildings and the other of which owns a purchase option on
  a street retail building. The ten buildings, valued at $28 million, are
  located in Pasadena, Santa Monica and San Diego, California. Nine of the ten
  buildings are scheduled to be renovated and retenanted. The Trust will
  contribute 90% of future capital costs. The limited partners who contributed
  $10.4 million to the partnerships will receive a cumulative return of $762,000
  per year. All remaining income and cash available for distribution will be
  allocated 90% to the Trust and 10% to the minority partners until each
  receives a return of 10% on its deemed investment and then 60% to the Trust
  and 40% to the minority partner.

       During 1996 the Trust invested $42.4 million in improvements to its
  properties; these improvements included: (1) $11.5 on the final tenant work
  and construction of an additional 30,000 square feet at Congressional Plaza,
  which includes the Trust's corporate offices; (2) $4.7 million on the
  redevelopment and expansion of a portion of Bethesda Row; (3) $3.9 million on
  the redevelopment of Brick Plaza which was begun in 1995; and (4) $2.3 million
  to buy out below market leases.

       In 1995 the Trust purchased 19 retail properties. The Trust also
  purchased a building abutting Flourtown Shopping Center, one of its existing
  centers, for $3.1 million. The Finley Square Shopping Center in suburban
  Chicago, Illinois was purchased on April 27, 1995 for approximately $18.8
  million in cash; Bristol Shopping Center in Bristol, Connecticut was purchased
  on September 22, 1995 for $19.6 million, by assuming a $11.3 million mortgage
  and by issuing common shares valued at $7.3 million with the balance in cash;
  Park & Shop Center in Washington, D.C. was purchased on December 1, 1995 for
  $11.2 million in cash; and on December 21, 1995 Shirlington Shopping Center in
  Arlington, Virginia was purchased for $23.5 million in cash. The retail
  building acquisitions during 1995 were as follows: seven buildings in West
  Hartford, Connecticut for $15.3 million; two buildings in Greenwich,
  Connecticut for $14.9 million; one building in Westport, Connecticut for $5.7
  million; one building in Brookline, Massachusetts for $3.8 million; one
  building in Westfield, New Jersey for $2.2 million; two buildings in Evanston,
  Illinois for $3.6 million; and a building contiguous to Bethesda Row in
  Bethesda, Maryland for $2.0 million.
 
       During 1995, $33.8 million was expended on improvements to Trust
  properties. These improvements included $3.8 million on the


 
  redevelopment of Congressional Plaza in Rockville, Maryland, $5.5 million to
  complete the redevelopment and retenanting of Gaithersburg Square in
  Gaithersburg, Maryland and $5.8 million for the first phase of the renovation
  of Brick Plaza in Brick, New Jersey.

       During 1994 the Trust purchased four shopping centers and one retail
  building, Idylwood Plaza in Falls Church, Virginia, North Lake Commons in Lake
  Zurich, Illinois, Garden Market Shopping Center in Western Springs, Illinois,
  Queen Anne Plaza in Norwell, Massachusetts and the Ship's Building in
  Westport, Connecticut. In addition, the Trust purchased a 3.9 acre parcel of
  land, on which there is a supermarket, which adjoins its Bala Cynwyd Shopping
  Center. These properties were acquired for a total cash investment of $48.3
  million and a $1.1 million note.

       During 1994, $42.3 million was expended on improvements to Trust
  properties. These improvements included $15.5 million on the renovation and
  expansion of Congressional Plaza in Rockville, Maryland, $4.1 million to
  complete the redevelopment of Ellisburg Circle Shopping Center in Cherry Hill,
  New Jersey, and $3.9 million to begin the redevelopment and retenanting of
  Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

       The majority of these acquisitions and improvements, as well as debt
  repayment requirements, were initially financed with borrowings under the
  Trust's revolving credit facilities. The Trust uses these credit facilities to
  fund acquisitions and other cash requirements until conditions are favorable
  for issuing equity or long term debt. In August 1996, the Trust amended these
  unsecured medium term revolving credit facilities, increasing the aggregate
  amount available from $130 million to $135 million, extending the maturity
  from three years to five years, and decreasing the interest rate from LIBOR
  (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 75 to 100 basis points to LIBOR plus 75
  basis points. The facilities require fees and have covenants requiring a
  minimum shareholders' equity and a maximum ratio of debt to net worth. At
  December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, $59.4 million, $40.1 million and $54.7
  million, respectively, was borrowed under these facilities. The maximum amount
  borrowed under these facilities during 1996, 1995 and 1994 was $76.2 million,
  $66.8 million and $54.7 million, respectively. The weighted average interest
  rate on borrowings during 1996, 1995 and 1994 was 6.4%, 6.9%, and 5.6%,
  respectively.

       Borrowings on these revolving credit facilities were repaid from a
  variety of long term debt and equity issues. In August 1996 the Trust issued
  $50.0 million of 7.48% Debentures due August 15, 2026, netting approximately
  $49.8 million. The debentures, which pay interest semiannually on February 15
  and August 15, are redeemable at par at the option of the holders on August
  15, 2008 and by the Trust at any time thereafter. On May 24, 1996 the Trust
  sold 1.8 million shares at $22 per share to an institutional investor, netting
  approximately $39.3 million. On December 13, 1996 the Trust sold another 1.6
  million shares to the public at $27 7/8 per share, netting $42.9 million.
  Another three million shares were sold to an institutional investor on
  February 4, 1997 for $28 per share, netting $83.9 million.


 
       During 1995 the Trust issued $165 million of senior notes: $100.0 million
  at 8 7/8% interest in January, netting proceeds of approximately $98.9
  million; $25.0 million at 8% interest in April, netting approximately $24.9
  million; and $40.0 million at 6 5/8% interest in December, netting
  approximately $39.6 million. In January 1995 the Trust repaid a $22.5 million
  mortgage which had been borrowed in 1994 and a $1.1 million note issued in
  connection with the purchase of Queen Anne Plaza in 1994.

       In order to minimize the risk of changes in interest rates, in connection
  with certain of these debt issues the Trust entered into interest rate hedge
  agreements. All agreements have been terminated and the cost or gain on the
  hedges is being recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of
  the financing.
 
       In April 1994 the Trust raised net proceeds of $61.3 million from a
  public offering of 2.5 million common shares of beneficial interest
  ("shares").  In a concurrent offering of 840,000 shares to an institutional
  investor, the Trust raised net proceeds of $21.7 million.  In April 1994 the
  Trust redeemed $39.8 million principal amount of its 5 1/4% convertible
  subordinated debentures due 2002 at a price equal to 120% of their principal
  amount or $47.8 million.  In November 1994 the Trust spent $4.2 million to
  exercise the option to purchase the land at Northeast Shopping Center, $3.4
  million of which had been recorded as a capital lease obligation.

       The Trust has budgeted $44.0 million for capital improvements to its
  properties in 1997. These improvements include: (1) $6.0 million for the next
  phase of the redevelopment and expansion of Brick Plaza; (2) $6.1 million to
  renovate and retenant Troy Shopping Center; (3) $4.1 million to renovate
  Feasterville Shopping Center; and (4) $3.5 million to complete the renovation
  and expansion of a portion of Bethesda Row.

       The Trust's long term debt has varying maturity dates and in a number of
  instances includes balloon payments or other contractual provisions that could
  require significant repayments during a particular period. The next
  significant maturity is approximately $53.5 million of mortgage obligations
  which are due in 1998.

       The Trust is seeking to increase its pace of acquisitions, both shopping
  centers and main street retail buildings. In addition, the Trust is searching
  for site acquisitions in its core markets to permit the Trust to build new
  shopping centers.

       The Trust will need additional capital in order to fund these
  acquisitions, expansions and refinancings. Sources of this funding may be
  proceeds from the sale of existing properties, additional debt and additional
  equity. The timing and choice between additional debt or equity will depend
  upon many factors, including the market price for the Trust's shares, interest
  rates and the Trust's ratio of debt to net worth. The Trust believes that it
  will be able to raise this capital as needed, based on its past success in so
  doing.


 
  Contingencies
  -------------

       As previously reported, certain of the Trust's shopping centers have some
  environmental contamination. The Trust has retained an environmental
  consultant to investigate contamination at a center in New Jersey. The Trust
  is evaluating whether it has insurance coverage for this matter. At this time,
  the Trust has not determined what the range of remediation costs might be, but
  does not believe that the costs will have a material effect upon the Trust's
  financial condition. The Trust has also identified chlorinated solvent
  contamination at another property. The contamination appears to be linked to
  the current and/or previous dry cleaner. The Trust intends to look to the
  responsible parties for any remediation effort. Evaluation of this situation
  is preliminary and it is impossible, at this time, to estimate the range of
  remediation costs, if any.

       The Trust reserved $2.0 million at closing in 1993 for environmental
  issues associated with Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center. Pursuant to an
  indemnity agreement entered into with the seller at closing, the Trust agreed
  to take certain actions with respect to identified chlorinated solvent
  contamination. The seller indemnified the Trust for certain third party claims
  and government requirements related to contamination at adjacent properties.
  During the fourth quarter of 1996, the reserve was reduced to $200,000 with a
  corresponding reduction in the basis of land at the shopping center. The Trust
  estimates that $200,000 is the cost to monitor the contaminant concentrations
  in groundwater for ten years, thereby satisfying regulatory requirements, to
  the best of the Trust's knowledge.

       Pursuant to the provisions of the respective partnership agreements, in
  the event of the exercise of put options by the other partners, the Trust
  would be required to purchase the 99% limited partnership interest at
  Loehmann's Plaza at its then fair market value and a 22.5% interest at
  Congressional Plaza at its then fair market value.

       Under the terms of the CIM partnerships, if certain leasing and revenue
  levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships, the limited
  partners may require the Trust to purchase their partnership interests at a
  formula price based upon net operating income. The purchase price may be paid
  in cash or common shares of the Trust, at the election of the limited
  partners. If the limited partners do not redeem their interest, the Trust may
  choose to purchase the limited partnership interests upon the same terms.

       Recently unfavorable trends in the retail environment have led to a
  number of retail bankruptcies. A further weakening of the retail environment,
  additional bankruptcies and further retail consolidations could adversely
  impact the Trust, by increasing vacancies and decreasing rents. In past
  difficult retail and real estate environments, the Trust has been able to
  replace weak and bankrupt tenants with stronger tenants; management believes
  that due to the quality of the Trust's properties there will continue to be
  demand for its retail space.


 
  Results of Operations
  ---------------------

       Net income and funds from operations have been affected by the Trust's
  recent acquisition, redevelopment and financing activities. The Trust has
  historically reported its funds from operations in addition to its net income
  and net cash provided by operating activities. Funds from operations is a
  supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating performance which
  excludes historical cost depreciation, since real estate values have
  historically risen and fallen with market conditions rather than over time.
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines
  funds from operations as follows: income before depreciation and amortization
  of real estate assets and before extraordinary items and significant non-
  recurring events less gains on sale of real estate. Funds from operations does
  not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by
  operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Rather, funds from operations
  has been adopted by real estate investment trusts to provide a consistent
  measure of operating performance in the industry.

       The reconciliation of net income to funds from operations is as follows:

                                                                    

       The Trust's retail leases generally provide for minimum rents, with
  periodic increases. Most retail tenants pay a majority of on-site operating
  expenses and real estate taxes. Many leases also contain a percentage rent
  clause which calls for additional rents based on tenant sales, so that at a
  given sales volume, if prices increase, so does rental income. These features
  in the Trust leases reduce the Trust's exposure to higher costs caused by
  inflation, although inflation has not been significant in recent years.

       Rental income, which consists of minimum rent, percentage rent, and cost
  recoveries, increased 11.5% in 1995 to $142.8 million from $128.1 million in
  1994 and 15.4% in 1996 to $164.9 million. If centers acquired and sold in
  1994, 1995 and 1996 are excluded, rental income increased 4.3% from 1994 to
  1995 and 6.6% from 1995 to 1996.

       Minimum rents increased 14% in 1995 to $113.9 million from $99.9 million
  in 1994 and 15.5% in 1996 to $131.5 million. If


 
  centers acquired and sold in 1994, 1995 and 1996 are excluded, minimum rents
  increased 6.7% from 1994 to 1995 and 6.2% from 1995 to 1996. Fifty percent of
  the increase in minimum rent in 1996 was from Congressional Plaza, Brick Plaza
  and Gaithersburg Square, which have been redeveloped and retenanted. Thirty-
  four percent of the increase in minimum rent in 1995 was from Congressional
  Plaza.

       Cost reimbursements consist of tenant reimbursements of real estate taxes
  (real estate tax recovery) and common area maintenance expenses (CAM
  recovery). After removing the effect of properties purchased and sold during
  the past three years, real estate tax recovery increased 6.2% from 1994 to
  1995 and 9.7% from 1995 to 1996. Forty-nine percent of the increase from 1994
  to 1995 was attributable to Congressional Plaza as its occupancy increased
  after being vacated for renovation. Sixty-four percent of the increase in 1996
  was attributable to Congressional Plaza, Brick Plaza and Gaithersburg Square.
  CAM recovery on the portfolio, adjusted to remove the effect of properties
  purchased in 1994, 1995 and 1996, was $13.2 million in 1994, $11.5 million in
  1995 and $13.2 million in 1996. These fluctuations correspond to fluctuations
  in CAM expenses, primarily snow removal and related repairs which were high in
  1994 and 1996 due to heavy snowfalls in those years.

       Other property income includes items which tend to fluctuate from period
  to period, such as utility reimbursements, telephone income, merchant
  association dues, lease termination fees, late fees and temporary tenant
  income. The increases from 1994 to 1996 were due primarily to the fluctuating
  nature of the income. Major increases in 1995 over 1994 resulted from lease
  termination fees, an unexpected recovery from a bankrupt tenant, merchant
  association dues and a commission on telephone services. The increase from
  1995 to 1996 was due to lease termination fees.
 
       Rental expenses went from $35.8 million in 1994 to $35.1 million in 1995
  to $40.7 million in 1996, which represents 26.8% of property income (rental
  income plus other property income) in 1994, 23.4% in 1995 and 23.3% in 1996.
  If rental expenses are adjusted to remove the effect of properties purchased
  and sold in 1994, 1995 and 1996, rental expenses ranged from $35.1 million in
  1994 to $32.6 million in 1995 to $35.3 million in 1996. The primary reason for
  the decrease from 1994 to 1995 was a decrease in snow removal and other
  related expenses, such as roof and parking lot repairs. The increase from 1995
  to 1996 was caused by an increase in snow related expenses and by an increase
  in the write-off of tenant work and lease commissions, often connected with
  tenants whose leases were terminated. Real estate taxes have ranged from 9.0%
  of property income in 1994 to 9.6% in 1995 to 9.4% in 1996. The lower
  percentage in 1994 was primarily due to Congressional Plaza, which received a
  refund of prior year taxes in 1994.

       Depreciation and amortization expenses have increased because of the
  recent acquisitions and also because of the depreciation on recent tenant work
  and property improvements.
 
       Interest income has increased slightly over the past three years. The
  Trust's major sources of interest income are on its mortgage notes receivable,
  its notes to officers, and its available cash balances. Increases in interest
  income due to the issuance of


 
  $14.3 million in mortgage notes receivable in 1996 were offset by decreases in
  interest on investments in marketable securities which the Trust sold in 1995.
  Included in interest income in 1995 is the effect of the sale in December 1995
  of the Trust's investment in Olympia and York Senior First Mortgage Notes and
  other real estate investment trusts, both of which were written down to market
  value in prior years.

       Interest expense increased to $45.6 million in 1996 from $39.3 million in
  1995, due to interest on the $50 million of senior debentures issued in 1996
  and the $165 million of senior notes issued in 1995, due to interest from
  increased usage of the revolving credit facilities and due to interest on the
  mortgage assumed upon the purchase of Bristol Shopping Center. Interest
  expense increased from $31.5 million in 1994 to $39.3 million in 1995,
  primarily due to interest on the three issues of senior notes in 1995. The
  ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.59x, 1.55x and 1.61x in 1996, 1995
  and 1994, respectively. The ratio of funds from operations to fixed charges
  was 2.35x, 2.35x, and 2.52x in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

       Administrative expenses have increased as the Trust has grown and as it
  has accelerated its acquisition and development efforts. Administrative
  expenses as a percentage of total income, however, were fairly constant, at
  5.1%, 4.7% and 4.8%, in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The $1.8 million
  increase from 1995 to 1996 was primarily due to the write-off of costs
  associated with unconsummated acquisition and development efforts and due to
  costs related to the move of the Trust's corporate office.  The major
  components of the increase in 1995 over 1994 were in payroll and in costs
  related to a business combination that the Trust decided not to pursue.

       Investors' share of operations represents the minority interest in
  Congressional Plaza, Loehmann's Plaza and North City Plaza. In 1995 minority
  net losses at Loehmann's and North City exceeded the minority net income at
  Congressional Plaza which was under redevelopment in 1995.

       Income before loss on sale of real estate and extraordinary item
  increased from $20.5 million in 1994 to $23.7 million in 1995 to $28.7 million
  in 1996, reflecting not only the contribution to net income from the Trust's
  acquisitions but also the contribution from improved operating results of the
  core portfolio.

       Loss or gain on the sale of real estate is dependent on the extent and
  timing of sales. The Trust regularly reviews its portfolio and does from time
  to time sell properties. In 1996 the Trust sold Town & Country Plaza in
  Hammond, Louisiana for $4.9 million, resulting in a loss of $12,000. In 1995
  the Trust sold North City Plaza for $1.8 million resulting in a loss on sale
  of $545,000.

       As a result of the foregoing items, net income rose from $20.5 million in
  1994 to $23.1 million in 1995 to $28.7 million in 1996.


 
       The Trust intends to increase its pace of acquisitions in 1997. If
  successful in so doing, these acquisitions should contribute to growth in
  rental income and expenses and, thereby, net income. The growth of the core
  portfolio, however, is, in part, dependent on controlling expenses, some of
  which are beyond the complete control of the Trust, such as snow removal, and
  trends in the retailing environment. Recently there have been a number of
  retailer bankruptcies and consolidations. These bankruptcies and a further
  weakening of the retail environment could adversely impact the Trust, by
  increasing vacancies and by decreasing rents. In past weak retail and real
  estate environments, the Trust has been able to replace weak and bankrupt
  tenants with stronger tenants; management believes that due to the quality of
  the Trust's properties there will continue to be demand for its retail space.

  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
  CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

  Trustees and Shareholders
  Federal Realty Investment Trust

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Federal Realty
  Investment Trust as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related
  consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
  for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996.  These
  financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust's management.  Our
  responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
  our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
  material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
  also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
  estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
  statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
  for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
  all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Federal Realty
  Investment Trust as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the consolidated results
  of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for each of the three years
  in the period ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted
  accounting principles.

  Federal Realty Investment Trust
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994


  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       Federal Realty Investment Trust invests in income-producing real estate
  properties. Traditionally it focused on community and neighborhood shopping
  centers, but beginning in late 1994 the Trust expanded its investments to
  main street retail properties, retail buildings and shopping centers in
  densely developed urban and suburban areas.  The Trust's leases with tenants
  are classified as operating leases and rental income is recognized on an
  accrual basis over the terms of the related leases.

       The Trust uses the straight-line method in providing for depreciation.
  Estimated useful lives range from three to 25 years on apartment buildings and
  improvements, and from three to 35 years on retail properties and 
  improvements.  Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as
  incurred.  Major improvements are capitalized.  The gain or loss resulting
  from the sale of  properties is included in net income at the time of sale.
  The Trust has adopted FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of".  The Trust does not hold
  any assets that meet the impairment criteria of FAS 121.

       The Trust capitalizes certain costs directly related to the acquisition,
  improvement and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and other
  related costs.  The capitalized costs associated with unsuccessful
  acquisitions are charged to operations when that determination is made.  The
  capitalized costs associated with improvements and leasing are depreciated or
  amortized over the life of the improvement and lease, respectively.

      Costs related to the issuance of debt instruments are capitalized and are
  amortized as interest expense over the life of the related issue using the
  interest method.  Upon conversion or in the event of redemption, applicable
  unamortized costs are charged to shareholders' equity or to operations,
  respectively.

       The Trust operates in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a real
  estate investment trust under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code
  (the "Code").  Under those sections, a trust which distributes at least 95% of
  its real estate trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which
  meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its
  taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  Therefore, no
  provision for Federal income taxes is required.

       The Trust consolidates the financial statements of three wholly owned
  subsidiaries, eleven partnerships, and a joint venture which are controlled by
  the Trust. The equity interests of other investors are reflected as investors'
  interest in

                                      F7

 
  consolidated assets.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances
  are eliminated.

       The Trust defines cash as cash on hand, demand deposits with financial
  institutions and short term liquid investments with an initial maturity under
  three months.  Cash balances may exceed insurable amounts.

       The Trust occasionally enters into derivative contracts with terms up to
  90 days prior to a scheduled financing or refinancing in order to minimize the
  risk of changes in interest rates.  The cost or gain on these transactions is
  recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the financing.

       Earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of
  shares outstanding during the respective periods, including options. Options
  are accounted for in accordance with APB 25, whereby if options are priced at
  fair market value or above at the date of grant, no compensation expense is
  recognized.

       Inherent in the preparation of the Trust's financial statements are
  certain estimates.  These estimates are prepared using management's best
  judgment, after considering past and current events.


  NOTE 1: REAL ESTATE AND ENCUMBRANCES

            A summary of the Trust's properties at December 31, 1996 is as
  follows:



       The Trust's 86 retail properties are located in 14 states and the
  District of Columbia, primarily along the East Coast between the Boston
  metropolitan area and Richmond, Virginia.  There are approximately 1,800
  tenants providing a wide range of retail products and services.  These tenants
  range from sole proprietorships to national retailers;  no one tenant or
  corporate group of tenants account for 5% or more of revenue.

       In 1996 the Trust acquired $105.6 million of retail property, comprised
  of three shopping centers and fourteen retail buildings.  With certain of
  these purchases the Trust made its first acquisitions in Florida and
  California.

                                      F8

 
       On October 1, 1996 the Trust acquired Saugus Plaza Shopping Center,
  located in the metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts area, for a total cash cost
  of $12.7 million. On October 29, 1996 Wynnewood Shopping Center in suburban
  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was purchased for a total cash cost of $21.8
  million. On December 31, 1996  the Trust acquired the controlling interest in
  a Limited Liability Company formed to own Escondido Promenade in suburban San
  Diego, California for $14.2 million in cash.  The $23.5 million center is
  encumbered by  $9.4 million of municipal bonds. The bonds, which mature
  October 1, 2016, bear interest at a variable rate determined weekly to be the
  interest rate which would enable the bonds to be remarketed at 100% of their
  principal amount.  The bonds are redeemable on demand by the holders and if
  they cannot be resold, will be due.  The other member of the Limited Liability
  Company, who is related to the developer of the property, has a minor interest
  in the profits of the property.

        On February 28, 1996 the Trust purchased, for cash, two retail buildings
  in Winter Park, Florida for a cost of $6.8 million.  In 1996 the Trust
  purchased two buildings in Greenwich, Connecticut, one  for $3.2 million in
  cash on May 6 and another for $9.5 million in cash on June 4.  On December 31,
  1996 the Trust made an investment of $17.6 million for the general partnership
  interest in two partnerships (the "CIM partnerships"), one of which owns ten
  street retail buildings and the other of which owns a purchase option on a
  street retail building.  The ten buildings, valued at $28 million, are located
  in Pasadena, Santa Monica and San Diego, California.  Nine of the ten
  buildings are scheduled to be renovated and retenanted.  The Trust will
  contribute 90% of future capital costs.  The limited partners who contributed
  $10.4 million to the partnerships will receive a cumulative return of $762,000
  per year.  All remaining income and cash available for distribution will be
  allocated 90% to the Trust and 10% to the minority partner until each receives
  a return of 10% on its deemed investment and then 60% to the Trust and 40% to
  the minority partner.

       The Trust purchased 19 retail properties during 1995 for a total cost of
  $120.6 million.  The Trust also purchased a building abutting Flourtown
  Shopping Center, one of its existing centers, for $3.1 million.  Finley Square
  Shopping Center in suburban Chicago was purchased on April 27, 1995 for $18.8
  million in cash; Bristol Shopping Center in Bristol, Connecticut was purchased
  on September 22, 1995 for $19.6 million, by assuming a $11.3 million mortgage
  and by issuing 337,527 common shares valued at $7.3 million with the balance
  in cash; Park & Shop Center in Washington, D.C. was purchased on December 1,
  1995 for $11.2 million in cash; and on December 21, 1995 Shirlington Shopping
  Center in Arlington, Virginia was purchased for $23.5 million in cash.  The
  retail building acquisitions during 1995 were as follows: seven buildings in
  West Hartford, Connecticut for $15.3 million; two buildings in Greenwich,
  Connecticut for $14.9 million; one building in Westport, Connecticut for $5.7
  million; one building in Brookline, Massachusetts for $3.8 million; one
  building in Westfield, New Jersey for $2.2 million; two buildings in Evanston,
  Illinois for $3.6 million and one building in Bethesda, Maryland, for $2.0
  million.

                                      F9

 
       In connection with certain of these purchases in 1996 and 1995, brokerage
  commissions of $172,000 and $671,000, respectively, were incurred to a company
  that is  owned by a brother of the Trust's president.  These commissions were
  paid pursuant to a brokerage contract on terms comparable to terms contained
  in contracts which the Trust has with brokers providing similar services in
  other geographic areas.

       On December 31, 1996 the Trust sold Town and Country Shopping Center in
  Hammond, Louisiana for $4.9 million, resulting in a loss of $12,000.

       On August 1, 1995 the Trust sold North City Shopping Center in New
  Castle, Pennsylvania for $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of $545,000.

       The Trust purchased four shopping centers in 1994.  Idylwood Plaza in
  Falls Church, Virginia was purchased for $14.3 million in cash;  North Lake
  Commons in Lake Zurich, Illinois was purchased for $10.9 million in cash;
  Garden Market Shopping Center in Western Springs, Illinois was purchased for
  $7.6 million in cash; and Queen Anne Plaza in Norwell, Massachusetts was
  purchased for $10.7 million in cash and a $1.1 million note which was paid in
  January 1995.  In addition the Trust purchased a 3.9 acre parcel of land
  underlying a supermarket which adjoins its Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center for
  cash of $1.1 million and a retail building in Westport, Connecticut for cash
  of $3.8 million.

       On April 22, 1996 the Trust made a $9.2 million convertible participating
  loan to a partnership, secured by retail properties in Philadelphia,
  Pennsylvania.  The loan bears interest at 10% plus additional interest based
  upon the gross income of the secured properties.  In addition, upon sale of
  the properties, the Trust will share in the appreciation of the properties.
  From and after April 2006, which date may be extended to April 2008, the Trust
  has the option to convert the loan into a partnership interest in the
  properties.  In 1995 and 1996 the Trust made additional loans, totalling $1.8
  million, secured by properties in Philadelphia, to partnerships with common
  ownership to the partnership above. One loan bears interest at the greater of
  prime plus 2% or 10% and the other bears interest at 5%. Both loans are due in
  November 1997.

       On July 2, 1996 the Trust was granted a purchase option on a parcel of
  land in Bethesda, Maryland in exchange for a refundable deposit of $50,000 and
  a $3.6 million loan secured by the land.  The loan requires monthly payments
  of interest at 9% until March 31, 1997 and 9.5% thereafter.  The Note is due
  on the earlier of the exercise of the purchase option or March 31, 1998.

       The Trust held two other mortgage loans at December 31, 1996, 1995 and
  1994.  The notes, which total approximately $13.2 million, bear interest at
  10% and were issued in connection with  the acquisition of Trust properties.

                                      F10

 
       In January 1994 a $22.5 million one year mortgage was placed on Northeast
  Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia.  The mortgage, which bore interest at LIBOR (London
  Interbank Offered Rate), plus 100 to 150 basis points was repaid in January
  1995.

       At December 31, 1996 the Trust had contracted to purchase the fee
  interest in Shillington, Troy and Feasterville Shopping Centers in January
  1997 for $1.8 million, $5.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively.  The Trust
  had also contracted to purchase the fee interest in Lawrence Park Shopping
  Center in June 1998 for $8.5 million.  In connection with the purchase
  agreement for Lawrence Park, the Trust, in January 1997, lent the seller $8.8
  million at 8% which is due in June 1998.  Future minimum lease payments due
  for Lawrence Park are $847,000 in 1997 and $438,000 in 1998 of which $346,000
  and $158,00, respectively represent interest.  These properties are subject to
  capital lease obligations of $7.6 million at December 31, 1996.

       In November 1994 the Trust exercised an option to purchase the ground
  underlying the Northeast Shopping Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for
  $4.2 million, $3.4 million of which had been recorded as a capital lease
  obligation.

       Mortgages payable and capital lease obligations are due in installments
  over various terms extending to 2060 with actual or imputed interest rates
  ranging from 7.9% to 11.25%.  Certain of the mortgage and capital lease
  obligations require additional interest payments based upon property
  performance.

       Aggregate mortgage principal payments due during the next five years are
  $1.4 million, $54.5 million, $532,000, $583,000, and $30.7, respectively.

       Future minimum lease payments and their present value for property under
  capital leases as of December 31, 1996, excluding the four leases to be
  purchased in 1997 and 1998, are as follows:



  Leasing Arrangements
  --------------------

       The Trust's leases with retail property and apartment tenants are
  classified as operating leases.  Leases on apartments are generally for a
  period of one year, whereas retail property leases generally range from three
  to 10 years and usually provide for contingent rentals based on sales and
  sharing of certain operating costs.

                                      F11

 
       The components of rental income are as follows:

 

       The components of rental expense are as follows:



       Minimum future retail property rentals on noncancelable operating leases
  as of December 31, 1996 are as follows:

 

  NOTE 2. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
  -------------------------------------------

       The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by the
  Trust, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.
  Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimates of fair value.  The
  estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that
  could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.

       The Trust estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using the
  following methods and assumptions: (1) quoted market prices, when available,
  are used to estimate the fair value of investments in marketable debt and
  equity securities; (2) quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair
  value of the Trust's marketable convertible subordinated debentures; (3)
  discounted cash flow analyses are used to

                                      F12

 
  estimate the fair value of long term  notes receivable and payable, using the
  Trust's estimate of current interest rates for similar notes; (4) carrying
  amounts in the balance sheet approximate fair value for cash and short term
  borrowings.  Notes receivable from officers are excluded from fair value
  estimation since they have been issued in connection with employee stock
  ownership programs.


 
  NOTE 3. NOTES PAYABLE
  ---------------------

       At December 31, 1996 and 1995 the Trust had notes payable of $66.1
  million and $50.0 million, respectively.  Of these balances, $59.4 million in
  1996 and $40.1 million in 1995 were issued under the Trust's revolving credit
  facilities.

       The remaining balance of notes payable was issued in connection with the
  acquisition, leasing or renovation of properties.  A $2.5 million noninterest
  bearing note was issued in September 1995 in connection with a lease
  transaction at Barracks Road. The due date of this note has been extended from
  December 1996 to July 15, 1997.  A note, with a balance of $1.3 million at
  December 31, 1996 and $1.4 million at December 31, 1995, was issued in
  connection with the buy out of a tenant at Queen Anne Plaza in January 1995.
  The noninterest bearing note of $2.2 million, due in annual installments of
  $200,000 for eleven years, was recorded at its discounted value using an
  interest rate of 8 7/8%.

        A 10% note, payable in equal monthly installments with a final maturity
  in 2013, issued in connection with the renovation of Perring Plaza had a
  balance of $2.9 million in 1996 and 1995.  A $3 million note issued in
  connection with the acquisition of Federal Plaza, bearing interest at 11%, was
  paid in 1996.

       In August 1996 the Trust amended its unsecured medium term revolving
  credit facilities with four banks, increasing the aggregate amount available
  from $130 million to $135 million, extending the maturity from three years to
  five, and decreasing the interest rate from LIBOR plus 75 to 100 basis points
  to LIBOR plus 75 basis points.  The facilities require fees and have covenants
  requiring a minimum shareholders' equity and a maximum ratio of debt to net
  worth.

                                      F13

 
       The maximum drawn under these facilities during 1996, 1995 and 1994 was
  $76.2 million, $66.8 million, and $54.7 million, respectively. In 1996, 1995
  and 1994 the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 6.4%, 6.9% and
  5.6%, respectively, and the average amount outstanding was $47.2 million,
  $26.7 million and $26.3 million, respectively.


  NOTE 4. DIVIDENDS
  -----------------

       On November 20, 1996 the Trustees declared a quarterly cash dividend of
  $.42 per share, payable January 15, 1997 to shareholders of record January 2,
  1997. For the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, $.21, $.43 and
  $.75 of dividends paid per share, respectively, represented a return of
  capital.

  NOTE 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
  -------------------------------------

       Pursuant to the provisions of the Loehmann's Plaza Limited Partnership
  Agreement, on or after September 1, 1995 the limited partner may require the
  Trust to purchase his interest in the Partnership at its then fair market
  value.

       The Congressional Plaza Shopping Center Joint Venture Agreement provides
  that upon six months advance notice the Trust can be required to purchase its
  pro rata share of one venturer's 22.5% or greater joint venture interest for a
  purchase price based on the appraised fair market value of the shopping
  center, but no less than the percentage of joint venture interest being sold
  multiplied by the difference between $17.5 million and the remaining principal
  balance of any liabilities of the Joint Venture.

       Under the terms of the CIM partnerships, if certain leasing and revenue
  levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships, the limited
  partners may require the Trust to purchase their partnership interests at a
  formula price based upon net operating income. The purchase price may be paid
  in cash or common stock of the Trust at the election of the limited partners.
  If the limited partners do not redeem their interest, the Trust may choose to
  purchase the limited partnership interests upon the same terms.

       As previously reported, certain of the Trust's shopping centers have some
  environmental contamination. The Trust has retained an environmental
  consultant to investigate contamination at a shopping center in New Jersey.
  The Trust is evaluating whether it has insurance coverage for this matter. At
  this time, the Trust has not determined what the range of remediation costs
  might be, but does not believe that the costs will have a material effect upon
  the Trust's financial condition. The Trust has also identified chlorinated
  solvent contamination at another property. The contamination appears to be
  linked to the current and/or previous dry cleaner. The Trust intends to look
  to the responsible parties for any remediation effort. Evaluation of this
  situation is preliminary and it is impossible, at this time, to estimate the
  range of remediation costs, if any.

                                      F14

 
            The Trust reserved approximately $2.0 million at closing in 1993 for
  environmental issues associated with Gaithersburg Square Shopping Center.
  Pursuant to an indemnity agreement entered into with the seller at closing,
  the Trust agreed to take certain actions with respect to identified
  chlorinated solvent contamination. The seller indemnified the Trust for
  certain third party claims and government requirements related to
  contamination at adjacent properties. During the fourth quarter of 1996, the
  reserve was reduced to $200,000 with a corresponding reduction in the basis of
  land at the shopping center. The Trust estimates that $200,000 is the cost to
  monitor contaminant concentrations in groundwater for ten years, thereby
  satisfying regulatory requirements, to the best of the Trust's knowledge.

       A nonqualified deferred compensation plan for Trust officers was
  established in 1994. The plan allows the officers to defer future income until
  the earlier of age 65 or termination of employment with the Trust. As of
  December 31, 1996, the Trust is liable to participants for approximately
  $671,000 under this plan. Although this is an unfunded plan, the Trust has
  purchased certain investments with which to match this obligation.

       The Trust has entered into agreements with certain key employees whereby
  if these employees voluntarily or involuntarily leave the employment of the
  Trust within six months after a "change of control" (defined as control of 35%
  or more of outstanding shares) of the Trust, they will be entitled to a lump
  sum cash payment equal to one to three times their annual salary as of the
  date of termination and have their health and welfare benefits and executive
  privileges continued for a period of one to three years. In the event of a
  change of control, the Trust also agreed that all restrictions on the exercise
  or receipt of any stock options and stock grants shall lapse upon termination
  of employment and that all shares owned at termination shall be redeemed by
  the Trust at a formula price.

       The Trust had previously entered into employment agreements with its
  President and certain other key employees for terms of up to three years,
  which automatically renewed at the end of each month unless either party
  notified the other that it elected not to extend the term. During 1994 the
  Trust offered certain of the employees covered under these agreements, other
  than the President, a severance agreement in lieu of the employment agreement.
  Two employees retained their employment agreements, which agreements now have
  a fixed declining term. The severance agreement prescribes that, among other
  things, if the employee is terminated without cause, he/she is entitled to
  salary for up to 18 months and benefits for up to nine months.

       As of December 31, 1996 in connection with the renovation of certain
  shopping centers, the Trust has contractual obligations of $3.2 million. In
  addition the Trust is contractually obligated under leases to provide up to
  $10.1 million in building and tenant improvements.

                                      F15

 
  The Trust is obligated under ground lease agreements on several shopping
  centers requiring minimum annual payments as follows:

 
  NOTE 6. 5 1/4% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES
  ---------------------------------------------------

       In October 1993 the Trust issued $75.0 million of 5 1/4% convertible
  subordinated debentures, realizing cash proceeds of approximately $73.0
  million. The debentures were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
  and were not publicly distributed within the United States. The debentures,
  which mature in 2003, are convertible into shares of beneficial interest at
  $36 per share. The debentures are redeemable by the Trust, in whole, at any
  time after October 28, 1998 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
  interest.


      At December 1996 and 1995 the Trust had outstanding $289,000 of 5 1/4%
  convertible subordinated debentures due 2002. The debentures which are
  convertible into shares of beneficial interest at $30.625 were not registered
  under the Securities Act of 1933 and were not publicly distributed within the
  United States. In April 1994, $39.8 million of the debentures were redeemed at
  a price equal to 120% of their principal amount or $47.8 million, in
  accordance with a premium put. A principal amount of $53,000 of these
  debentures was converted into 1,729 shares in 1994.

  NOTE 7. SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES
  -----------------------------------

       On August 16, 1996 the Trust issued $50.0 million of 7.48% Debentures due
  August 15, 2026, netting approximately $49.8 million after adjusting for
  underwriting discounts and other costs. The debentures, which were issued at a
  price of 99.96%, pay interest semiannually on February 15, and August 15. The
  debentures are redeemable at par at the option of the holders on August 15,
  2008 and by the Trust at any time thereafter.

       On January 19, 1995 the Trust issued $100.0 million of 8 7/8% Notes, due
  January 15, 2000. The notes, which were issued at a price of 99.815%, pay
  interest semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 and are not redeemable prior
  to maturity. After deducting the underwriting discount and other costs, the
  Trust netted approximately $98.9 million. In January 1995 the Trust executed a
  five year interest rate swap on $25.0 million, whereby the Trust swapped fixed
  interest payment obligations of 8.1% for a floating rate interest payment of
  three month LIBOR. The floating rate during the first quarter of 1995 was
  6.2%. In May 1995 the swap was terminated and the Trust sold the swap for $1.5
  million, which is being amortized as a deduction to interest expense over the
  remaining term.

                                      F16

 
       On April 21, 1995 the Trust issued $25.0 million of senior notes, netting
  $24.9 million after deducting discounts and costs. The notes, which are due
  April 21, 2002 and bear interest at 8%, payable semiannually on April 21 and
  October 21, were issued at a price of 99.683%.

       On December 8, 1995 the Trust issued an additional $40.0 million of
  senior notes, netting $39.6 million after deducting costs. The notes, which
  mature on December 1, 2005 and bear interest at 6 5/8%, payable June 1 and
  December 1, were issued at a price of 99.3%.


  NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
  ----------------------------

       On May 24, 1996 the Trust sold, to an institutional investor, 1.8 million
  shares of beneficial interest ("shares") at $22 per share, netting $39.3
  million. On December 13, 1996 the Trust sold another 1.6 million shares to the
  public at $27 7/8 per share, netting $42.9 million.

       In September 1995 the Trust issued 337,527 shares of beneficial interest
  valued at $7.3 million in partial consideration for the purchase of Bristol
  Shopping Center.

       In April 1994 the Trust raised net proceeds of $61.3 million from a
  public offering of 2.5 million shares of beneficial interest. In a concurrent
  offering of 840,000 shares to an institutional investor, the Trust raised net
  proceeds of $21.7 million.

       The Trust has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, whereby shareholders may use
  their dividends to purchase shares. In 1996, 1995, and 1994, 181,274 shares,
  193,965 shares, and 162,466 shares, respectively, were issued under the Plan.

       On January 1, 1994 under the terms of the 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan,
  an officer of the Trust purchased 40,000 common shares at $25 per share with
  the assistance of a $1.0 million loan from the Trust. The loan, which has a
  term of 12 years, bears interest at 6.24%. Forgiveness of up to 75% of the
  loan is subject to the future performance of the Trust. One eighth of the loan
  was forgiven on January 31, 1995; another one sixteenth was forgiven on each
  of January 31, 1996 and 1997 as certain performance criteria of the Trust were
  met.

       In January 1991 the Trustees adopted the Federal Realty Investment Trust
  Share Purchase Plan. Under the terms of this plan, officers and certain
  employees of the Trust purchased 446,000 common shares at $15.125 per share
  with the assistance of loans of $6.7 million from the Trust. Originally, the
  Plan called for one sixteenth of the loan to be forgiven each year for eight
  years, as long as the participant was still employed by the Trust. The loans
  for all participants, but two, were modified in 1994 to extend the term an
  additional four years and to tie forgiveness in 1995 and thereafter to certain
  performance criteria of the Trust. One sixteenth of the loan was forgiven in
  1995 and 1996. The Trust has loaned participants $1.1 million to pay the taxes
  due in connection with the plan. The purchase

                                      F17

 
  loans and the tax loans bear interest at 9.39%. The shares purchased under the
  plan may not be sold, pledged or assigned until both the purchase and tax
  loans are satisfied and the term has expired.

        In connection with a restricted share grant, the Trust accepted from its
  President a noninterest bearing note for $210,000. One installment of $105,000
  was paid on the note in 1992 and the second installment is due April 15, 2001.
  This loan, tax loans issued in connection with 108,000 shares granted to
  officers and key employees under the terms of the 1988 Share Bonus Plan, the
  last $16,000 of which were forgiven in 1996, and the tax loans issued under
  the Share Purchase Plan are recorded as notes receivable -officers.

       At December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, the Trust had 62,386
  shares, 61,328 shares and 60,200 shares in treasury at a cost of $1.2 million,
  $1.2 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.

       On April 13, 1989, the Trustees adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (the
  Plan). Under the Plan, one right was issued for each outstanding share of
  common stock held as of April 24, 1989, and a right will be attached to each
  share issued in the future. The rights are exercisable into common shares upon
  the occurrence of certain events, including acquisition by a person or group
  of certain levels of beneficial ownership or a tender offer by such a person
  or group. The rights are redeemable by the Trust for $.01 and expire on April
  24, 1999.

  NOTE 9. STOCK OPTION PLAN
  -------------------------

       The 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan ("Plan") authorized the grant of
  options and other stock based awards for up to 6.0 million shares. Options
  granted under the plan have ten year terms and vest in one to three years.
  Under the Plan, on each annual meeting date during the term of the plan, each
  nonemployee Trustee will be awarded 2,500 options. Accordingly, on each of May
  2, 1996, May 10, 1995 and May 4, 1994, 22,500, 20,000 and 20,000 options,
  respectively, were awarded to nonemployee Trustees. In 1996, 81,181 options at
  $21 to $21 5/8 per share were granted to employees of the Trust. On February
  15, 1995, 719,000 stock options at $20.75 per share were granted to employees
  of the Trust.
 
       The option price to acquire shares under the 1993 Plan and previous plans
  is required to be at least the fair market value at the date of grant. As a
  result of the exercise of options, the Trust had outstanding from its officers
  and employees notes for $2.2 million at December 31, 1996 and $1.9 million at
  December 31, 1995. The notes issued under the 1993 plan bear interest at the
  dividend rate on the date of exercise divided by the purchase price of such
  shares. The notes issued under the previous plans bear interest at the lesser
  of (i) the Trust's borrowing rate or (ii) the current indicated annual
  dividend rate on the shares acquired pursuant to the option, divided by the
  purchase price of such shares. The notes are collateralized by

                                      F18

 
  the shares and are with recourse. The loans have a term extending to the
  employee's or officer's retirement date.

       FAS Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" requires
  pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share as if the
  Trust accounted for its stock options under the fair value method of that
  Statement. The fair value for options issued in 1996 and 1995 has been
  estimated as $120,000 and $1.4 million, respectively, as of the date of grant,
  using a binomial model with the following weighted-average assumptions for
  1996 and 1995, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 5.7% and 7.3%;
  volatility factors of the expected market price of the Trust's shares of 19%
  and 19%; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 5.6 years and
  6.3 years.

       Because option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
  assumptions, such as the expected stock price volatility, and because changes
  in these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
  estimate, the existing model may not necessarily provide a reliable single
  measure of the fair value of its stock options.

       For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
  options are amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The pro
  forma information is as follows:

   

       A summary of the Trust's stock option activity for the years ended
  December 31, is as follows:

  

        At December 31, 1996 and 1995, options for 942,270 shares and 609,300
  shares, respectively, were exercisable. The average remaining contractual life
  of options outstanding at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was 7.1 years and 7.8
  years, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value per option for
  options

                                      F19

 
  granted in 1996 and 1995 was $1.47 and $1.83, respectively.  The exercise
  price of options outstanding at December 31, 1996 ranged from $17.25 per share
  to $26.00 per share.


  NOTE 10. SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN
  ------------------------------------

       The Trust has a savings and retirement plan in accordance with the
  provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees'
  contributions range, at the discretion of each employee, from 1% to 17% of
  compensation up to a maximum of $9,500. Under the plan, the Trust, out of its
  current net income, contributes 50% of each employee's first 5% of
  contributions. In addition, the Trust may make discretionary contributions
  within the limits of deductibility set forth by the Code. Employees of the
  Trust, who work over 1,000 hours annually, are eligible to become plan
  participants. The Trust's expense for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995
  and 1994 was $179,000, $158,000 and $147,000, respectively. In 1996 and 1995
  the Trust recorded a liability for an additional contribution of 1.5% and 1%
  of salary, respectively, for all nonofficer employees who are eligible for the
  401(k) plan. In addition, 1.5% of salary in 1996 and 1% of salary in 1995 was
  accrued for all eligible nonofficer employees as a bonus.

  NOTE 11. INTEREST EXPENSE
  -------------------------

       The Trust incurred interest expense totaling $46.4 million, $40.2 million
  and $31.8 million, in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, of which $871,000,
  $975,000, and $348,000, respectively, was capitalized. Interest paid was $44.2
  million in 1996, $33.4 million in 1995, and $39.9 million in 1994 which
  included $8.0 million of the premium on the 5 1/4% convertible subordinated
  debentures which were redeemed in April 1994.

  NOTE 12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
  --------------------------

       On January 31, 1997, 22,000 restricted shares were granted to an officer
  and two employees of the Trust.  The shares vest over three years.

       On January 6, 1997 as described in Footnote 1, the Trust purchased the
  fee interest on three shopping centers and exercised an option to purchase the
  fee on another shopping center.  The Trust previously held these properties
  under a capital lease. On January 22, 1997 the Trust purchased a retail
  building in Chicago, Illinois for cash of $4.2 million.

       On February 4, 1997 the Trust sold 3.0 million shares to an institutional
  investor for $28 per share, netting $83.9 million.

                       NON-EXCLUSIVE BROKERAGE AGREEMENT
                       ---------------------------------



This Agreement is made and entered into on this third day of December, 1996 by
and between Federal Realty Investment Trust, an unincorporated business trust
organized under the business laws of the District of Columbia and Street Retail,
Inc., a Maryland corporation (collectively, "Client"), and Westport Realty
Advisors, Inc. and Jack Alan Guttman (collectively, "Broker").

In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree as follows:

1.  This Agreement replaces the Exclusive Brokerage Agreement by and between
Client and Broker dated August 20, 1995 ("Prior Agreement") in its entirety.  As
of August 21, 1996, the Prior Agreement is terminated and its terms and
provisions, including Section 6, but excluding Section 7, thereof, are null and
void.

2.  Client hereby appoints Broker as its non-exclusive real estate broker for
the purchase of urban retail buildings and traditional "strip" shopping centers
and shopping malls (collectively, "Properties") located in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, New York and New Jersey (collectively, "Broker Area").  Broker
shall perform the duties of a real estate broker; specifically, Broker shall
conduct searches for Properties which fit the criteria established by Client and
assist Client with all aspects of the due diligence process in order to enable
Client to evaluate the desirability and feasibility of acquiring such Properties
or any interest therein; such assistance shall include collecting and providing
Client with market information such as demographics, information on competing
Properties, comparable rentals and sales and assistance in the appraisal and
underwriting of the Properties.  Client shall have a right of first refusal,
which refusal must be in writing, on all Properties identified or located by
Broker in Broker's Area before Broker can identify, offer or show such
Properties to any other potential purchaser.  Client must respond to Broker
indicating interest in pursuing or not pursuing such Properties within 14 days
of receipt of Broker's identification of such Properties.  Client's indication
of interest in such Properties shall not bind Client in any way to purchase such
Properties, and no Commission (as that term is defined herein) shall be paid to
Broker unless the conditions precedent to the payment of a Commission set forth
in Section 6 hereof have been met.  Client shall notify Broker if it later
determines not to continue investigating the possibility of a purchase of any
such Properties.  Following such notification of refusal, Broker may identify,
offer or show any such Properties to any other potential purchaser.

3.  Broker represents and warrants that:

     a)   Broker will act in accordance with the highest professional standards
          of the industry and in compliance with all applicable laws,
          regulations, codes, ordinances and orders.



                                      F29

 
Non-Exclusive Brokerage Agreement


     b)   There are no obligations, commitments, or impediments of any kind that
          will limit or prevent the Broker's performance of its services and
          obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

     c)   The Broker is duly licensed as a real estate broker in the States of
          Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.

     d)   Broker will perform its services in a professional manner and in the
          most expeditious and economical manner consistent with the interest of
          Client.

     e)   Broker is an independent contractor and not an employee of Client.

     f)   Broker solely represents Client in any transaction pursuant to this
          Agreement and must disclose Broker's sole representation of Client to
          all third parties contacted in connection with this Agreement.

     g)   Broker shall NOT disclose to any prospective seller or anyone else
          information obtained within the confidentiality and trust of the
          fiduciary relationship with Client, nor disclose to the prospective
          seller or anyone else information similarly obtained from Client
          without the consent of Client.

     h)   Broker shall NOT receive any fees, commissions or other remuneration
          other than the Commission (as hereinafter defined) from any seller,
          broker or any other source in connection with any property purchased
          by Client pursuant to this Agreement

4.   Broker's authority is limited to performing the services in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.  Broker does not have any authority to enter into
or execute any agreement for or on behalf of Client.  No written proposals,
offers or other information concerning Client shall be distributed without
Client's prior written consent, which may be withheld in Client's sole and
absolute discretion.  Client shall have the right to specify Broker's degree of
involvement, if any, with respect to any negotiation of any contract of sale
("Contract of Sale").  Broker acknowledges that entering into a Contract of Sale
involves negotiation of complex provisions and issues, including business, tax
and operational issues and liabilities relating to a property, and that Client,
therefore, expressly reserves the right to reject any and all proposals for a
Contract of Sale and to approve any and all terms and conditions of any proposed
Contract of Sale as Client sees fit, in Client's sole and absolute discretion.

5.   The term of this Agreement ("Term") shall commence on August 21, 1996 and
end at midnight on August 21, 1997, unless sooner terminated in accordance with
the provisions of this


                                      F30

 
Non-Exclusive Brokerage Agreement


Agreement.

6.   For transactions less than $10,000,001, Client shall pay Broker a
     commission (the "Commission") equal to:

     (i)    2.25% of the portion of the aggregate gross sales price ("Purchase
            Price") of the Properties acquired subject to this Agreement up to
            $2,000,000;

     (ii)   1.75% of the portion of the Purchase Price exceeding $2,000,000 up
            to $5,000,000;

     (iii)  1.50% of the portion of the Purchase Price exceeding $5,000,000 up
            to $10,000,000.

     For transactions exceeding $10,000,000, Client shall pay Broker a
commission (The "Commission") equal to:

     (i)    1.25% of the portion of the Purchase Price up to $15,000,000;

     (ii)   1.00% of the portion of the Purchase Price exceeding $15,000,000 up
            to $20,000,000;

     (iii)  .75% of the portion of the Purchase Price exceeding $20,000,000 up
            to $30,000,000;

     (iv)   .50% of the portion of the Purchase Price exceeding $30,000,000 up
            to $75,000,000;

     (v)    .25% of the portion of the Purchase Price exceeding $75,000,000.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
following shall be conditions precedent to Client's obligation to pay the
Commission:

     a)     The execution and delivery by Client and seller of a Contract of
            Sale for one or more Properties acceptable in form and substance to
            Client, in Client's sole and absolute discretion; and

     b)     The actual closing of the sale, including Client's payment of all
            monies due at closing, and transfer of title, or other evidence of
            ownership, to Client.


                                      F31

 
Non-Exclusive Brokerage Agreement

Failure of either of these conditions shall preclude any claim for a Commission
by Broker.  In no event shall Broker ever receive any fees, commissions, or
other remuneration from any seller, broker or other person or entity in
connection with properties purchased by Client pursuant to this Agreement.

Except following the occurrence of an Event of Default as described in Section
9, it is further understood that the Commission shall be paid to Broker if, (i)
within One Hundred Eighty (180) days after the expiration or termination of the
Term, Client enters into a Contract of Sale for one or more Properties presented
by Broker during the Term and named in a written list ("List") delivered to
Client by Broker within ten (10) days following the expiration of the Term or
the date of termination of this Agreement ("Period End"), provided that, no more
than five (5) Properties are included on the List, Broker is actively engaged in
negotiating the purchase by Client of each Property included on the List, all
Properties included on the List shall be agreed to by Client (which agreement
shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the owner of each Property included on
the List shall provide a letter to Client by the Period End indicating active
interest in selling such Property to Client, (ii) such purchase is ultimately
consummated, and (iii) the two conditions precedent to Client's obligation to
pay the Commission, as set forth above, have been met.  Broker's Commission
shall be the sole compensation paid to Broker and Broker shall not be entitled
to reimbursement for any expenses or any other sums Broker incurs related to or
involving the performance of the services.  The Commission shall be paid to
Broker at closing and Client hereby authorizes the attorney or title company
conducting the closing to disburse the Commission to Broker at such closing.
The Commission shall be payable if the transfer or sale is structured as a cash
sale, like-kind exchange, partial sale, joint venture, newly formed partnership
or transfer of stock.

7.   In no event shall Client be responsible to pay any persons or entities,
other than Broker, any commissions or other remuneration of any kind in
connection with this Agreement or by virtue of their association with Broker.
Further, Client shall not be obligated to see to the application of the
Commission, if any, due under this Agreement or the payment of any other
remuneration for the benefit of any persons or entities other than Broker and no
other persons or entity shall be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.
Broker shall be solely responsible for the direct payment of any commissions or
other remuneration of any kind due to other persons or entities claiming
entitlement to a share of the Commission or any other remuneration under this
Agreement or by virtue of their association with Broker.  Broker hereby agrees
to indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any and all claims,
demands, obligations, liabilities, losses and damages (including, without
limitation, attorney's fees of counsel selected by Client) arising directly or
indirectly out of or in connection with any claim for commissions or other
remuneration of any kind for any person or entity claiming by, through or under
Broker or relating in any way to this Agreement, or Broker's actions or failure
to act pursuant to this Agreement; it being understood and agreed that Client's
liability hereunder shall be limited to


                                      F32

 
Non-Exclusive Brokerage Agreement


the payment to Broker of the Commission, if any, owed under the Agreement.  In
the event any claims, demands, obligations, liabilities, losses and/or damages
arise in connection with any claim for commissions, fees or other remuneration,
Client may, in its sole and absolute discretion, withhold Commissions otherwise
payable to Broker pending final resolution and may offset against such
Commissions any such claims, demands obligations, liabilities, losses and or

                                    PREFACE

     Reference is made to the Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of June 22,
1993 between the Borrower and the Bank, as amended by the First Amendment to
Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of September 30, 1994 (as amended, the
"Credit Agreement"), and as further amended by the Second Amendment to Revolving
Credit Agreement dated as of October 23, 1995 (as amended the "Credit

not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.

     The Borrower has requested that the Credit Agreement be amended as
hereinafter provided to extend the Termination Date and to modify certain other
terms contained in the Credit Agreement.  The Bank is willing to agree to such
requests, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.  Amendments to the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement is hereby
amended as follows:

          (a)  Section 2.1 (a) of the Credit Agreement is amended by deleting
               the number "$30,000,000" in the fifth line and inserting in lieu
               thereof the number "25,000,000".

          (b)  Section 2.1 (b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
               deleting the date "July 1, 1998" in the first line of such
               subsection and inserting in lieu thereof the date "July 1, 2001".

          (c)  Section 2.3 (a) (vi) is amended by deleting the existing Section
               2.3 (a) (vi) and inserting in lieu thereof the following:

               "The Applicable Margin means the applicable margin set forth in
               the table below used in calculating the interest rate applicable
               to Prime

                                      F48

 
               Rate Loans and Euro-Dollar Loans which shall vary from time to
               time in accordance with the borrower's long-term unsecured debt
               ratings.  The Applicable Margin to be used in calculating the
               interest rate applicable to different Loans shall vary from time
               to time in accordance with Borrower's then applicable (x) Moody's
               debt rating and (y) S&P debt rating as the case may be.  The
               applicable debt ratings and the Applicable Margin are set forth
               in the following table:


               S&P means Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and its successors and
               Moody's means Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and its successors.
               In the event the Borrower receives ratings from S&P and Moody's
               that are not equivalent, the most recent rating in which S&P and
               Moody's had equivalent ratings will be used to determine the
               applicable margin.

          (d)  Section 3.1 (b) of the Credit Agreement is amended by deleting
               the existing Section 3.1 (b) and inserting in lieu thereof the
               following:

               "For the period from the date hereof to but not including the
               Termination Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank a fee at a
               rate in accordance with Borrower's then applicable (x) Moody's
               debt rating, and (y) S&P debt rating as the case may be, on the
               average unused portion of the Commitment, such fee shall be
               payable in arrears on the first day of January, April, July, and
               October of each year, and on the Termination Date.  The
               applicable rating and annual fee are set forth in the table
               below:


               In the event the Borrower receives ratings from S&P and Moody's
               that

                                      F49

 
               are not equivalent, the most recent rating in which S&P and
               Moody's had equivalent ratings will be used to determine the
               Annual Fee.

          (e)  Section 3 of the Credit Agreement is amended by adding a new
               section 3.6 to read as follows:

               "3.6 Reduction of Commitment.  The Borrower shall have the right
               at any time from time to time upon five (5) Business Days prior
               written notice to the Bank to reduce by $1,000,000 or an integral
               multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or terminate entirely
               the unborrowed portion of the then Commitment.  Upon the
               effective date of any such reduction or termination, the Borrower
               shall pay to the Bank the full amount of any fees then accrued on
               the reduction.  No reduction or termination of the Commitment may
               be reinstated."

          (f)  Section 7.15 (a) of the Credit Agreement (as amended by Section
               1(j) of the First Amendment) is amended by deleting the phrase
               "retail shopping centers" in the tenth line and inserting in lieu
               thereof the phrase "retail properties".

          (g)  Section 7.15 (b) of the Credit Agreement is amended by deleting
               the number "5%" in the seventh line and inserting in lieu thereof
               the number "10%".
