CON EDISON

Corporate Overview

Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in 1997, owns all of the outstanding common stock of Consolidated Edison Company
of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R). Con Edison of New York and O&R, which are regulated utilities, are referred to in this report
as the "Utilities" and, together with Con Edison, the "Companies." Con Edison has no significant business operations other than those of the Utilities and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries. See
"Corporate Overview" in Item 7.

Operating Segments

Con Edison's principal business segments are Con Edison of New York's regulated electric, gas and steam utility segments, O&R's regulated electric and gas
utility segments and the unregulated businesses of Con Edison's other subsidiaries. In 2003, the operating revenues of the Utilities were 90 percent of Con Edison's operating revenues. For a
discussion of operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see "Results of Operations" in Item 7. For additional segment information see Note O to the financial statements in Item
8 and the discussions of Utilities below in this Item 1.

Regulation

The Utilities are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including by state utility commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). Con Edison, itself, is not subject to such regulation except to the extent that the rules or orders of these agencies impose restrictions on relationships between Con Edison and the
Utilities. See "Regulation" in the discussion below of Con Edison of New York's business in this Item 1.

Con
Edison is a "holding company" under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Con Edison is exempt from all provisions of PUHCA, except Section 9(a)(2) (which requires SEC
approval for a direct or indirect acquisition of five percent or more of the voting


securities
of any other electric or gas utility company) on the basis that Con Edison and the Utilities are organized and carry on their utility businesses substantially in the State of New York and
that it does not derive any material part of its income from a public utility company organized outside of the State of New York. This exemption is available even though Con Edison subsidiaries that
are neither an "electric utility company" nor a "gas utility company," as defined, under PUHCA engage in interstate activities.

Con
Edison has been and is expected to continue to be impacted by legislative and regulatory developments. The Utilities are subject to extensive regulation in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to Con Edison's subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the Companies. See "Regulatory Matters" in Item 7.

Competition

See "Competition," below in the discussion of the businesses of the Utilities in this Item 1 and "Unregulated Subsidiaries," below.

Unregulated Subsidiaries

Con Edison has four unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells
electricity, gas and energy-related services to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R; Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale
energy supply company; Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects; and Con
Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications), a company that builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The unregulated subsidiaries participate in
competitive supply and services businesses that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the Utilities. The unregulated subsidiaries accounted for
almost 10 percent of consolidated operating revenues and a reduction in consolidated net income of 18 percent in 2003, and 7 percent of consolidated total assets at
December 31, 2003. For a discussion of the unregulated subsidiaries' operating revenues and operating income, see "Results of Operations—Unregulated Subsidiaries and Other" in Item
7.

Capital Requirements and Financing

For information about Con Edison's capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Resources,
Capital Requirements and Financial Market Risks" in Item 7. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities.
A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

State Anti-takeover Law

New York State law provides that a "domestic corporation," such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the
beneficial owner of a 20 percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five


years
after the acquisition of voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporation's board of directors prior to the
acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent "fair price" formula or with the
approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.

Employees

Con Edison has no employees other than those of Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries (which at December 31, 2003 had
12,648, 1,028 and 403 employees, respectively).

The
respective collective bargaining agreements covering about two-thirds of each of the Utilities' employees expire in June 2004.

CON EDISON OF NEW YORK

Corporate Overview

Con Edison of New York, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Con Edison of New
York provides electric service in all of New York City (except part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than eight
million. It also provides gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of Queens and Westchester, and steam service in parts of Manhattan.

Operating Segments

Con Edison of New York's principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses. In 2003, electric, gas and steam operating revenues
were 78 percent, 16 percent and 6 percent, respectively, of its operating revenues. For a discussion of the company's operating revenues and operating income for each segment,
see "Results of Operations" in Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.

Electric Operations

Electric Sales.

Electric operating revenues were $6 billion in 2003 or 78 percent of Con Edison of New York's operating
revenues. The percentages were 80 and 78 percent, respectively, in the two preceding years. In 2003, 57 percent of the electricity delivered by Con Edison of New York in its service
areas was sold by the company to its
full-service customers, 24 percent was sold by other suppliers, including Con Edison Solutions, an unregulated subsidiary of Con Edison, to the company's customers under its
electric retail access program and the balance was delivered to the state and municipal customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and the economic development customers of municipal electric
agencies. The company charges for the delivery of electricity sold by itself and other suppliers to customers in its service area.

For
additional information about electricity sales, see "Operating Statistics," below, and "Results of Operation—Electric" in Item 7.


Electric Peak Load.

The electric peak load in Con Edison of New York's service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The
2003 service area peak load, which occurred on June 26, was 11,875 thousand kilowatts (MW). The 2003 peak load included an estimated 7,220 MW for Con Edison of New York's
full-service customers, 2,725 MW for customers participating in its electric retail access program and 1,930 MW for NYPA's customers and municipal electric agency customers. If adjusted
to historical design weather conditions, the 2003 peak load would have been 12,600 MW. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2004 service area peak load will be 12,825 MW,
including an estimated 7,800 MW for its full-service customers, 2,930 for its electric retail access customers and 2,095 MW for NYPA's customers and municipal electric agency customers.
"Design weather" for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak load is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes.

Electric Supply.

Most of the electricity sold by Con Edison of New York to its customers in 2003 was purchased under firm power contracts
or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The firm power contracts were primarily with non-utility generators (NUGs).

The
company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers with electric energy purchased under contracts with NUGs or others, generated from its electric generating
facilities or purchased through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market.

For
additional information about electric power purchases, see "Regulatory Matters" and "Electric Power Requirements" in Item 7 and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial
statements in Item 8.

For
information about the company's contracts with NUGs for approximately 3,200 MW of electric generating capacity, see Note I to the financial statements in Item 8.

For
information about the company's 630 MW of electric generating facilities, see Item 2.

The
NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and operates most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State, including those of Con Edison of New
York, as an integrated system and administers a wholesale market for electricity in New York State. Pursuant to criteria that are reviewed annually, the NYISO requires that entities supplying
electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (either owned or contracted for) in an amount that is at least 18 percent above the expected peak load for their customers.
In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must have enough New York City-located capacity to cover 80 percent of their New York City
customer peak loads. Con Edison of New York met the requirements applicable to it in 2003 and expects to meet them in 2004.

Gas Operations

Gas Sales.

Gas operating revenues in 2003 were $1 billion or 16 percent of Con Edison of New York's operating revenues. The
percentages were 15 percent in each of the two preceding years. In 2003, 51 percent of the gas delivered by the company in its service area was sold by the


company
to its full-service (firm and interruptible) customers and 49 percent was sold by other suppliers, including Con Edison Solutions. For additional information about gas
sales, see "Operating Statistics," below, and "Results of Operations—Gas" in Item 7.

Gas Requirements.

Firm demand for gas in Con Edison of New York's service area peaks during the winter heating season. The "design
criteria" for the company's gas system assume severe weather conditions, which have not occurred since the 1933-34 winter. Under these criteria, the company estimated that its
requirements to deliver gas to firm customers during the November 2003/March 2004 winter heating season would amount to 78,900 thousand dekatherms (mdths) (including 67,600 mdths
to its firm sales customers and 11,300 mdths to its firm transportation customers). Through January 31, 2004, the company's peak throughput day in this heating season occurred on
January 26, 2004 when it delivered 1,068 mdths of gas (including 750 mdths to its firm sales customers, 17 mdths to NYPA, 190 mdths to its transportation customers and 111 mdths for use by the
company in generating electricity and steam).

Under
its design criteria, the company projects that for the November 2004/March 2005 winter heating season, its requirements for firm gas customers will amount to 79,500 mdths
(including 67,800 mdths to firm sales customers and 11,700 mdths to firm transportation customers) and that the peak day requirements for these customers will amount to 978 mdths. The company expects
to be able to meet these requirements.

Gas Supply.

Con Edison of New York and O&R have established a combined gas supply and capacity portfolio. The combined portfolio is
administered by, and related management services are provided by, Con Edison of New York (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions
approved by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC). See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.

Charges
from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The contracts are for
various terms extending to 2008. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation and storage services. Charges under these contracts are
approved by the FERC. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2013. The Utilities are required to pay certain charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not
the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $129 million in 2003. See "Contractual Obligations" in Item 7. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas
on the spot market and have interruptible gas transportation contracts. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

Steam Operations

Steam Sales.

Con Edison of New York sells steam in Manhattan south of 96th Street, mostly to large office buildings, apartment houses and
hospitals. In 2003, steam operating revenues were $537 million or 6 percent of the company's operating revenues. The percentages were 6 percent in the two preceding years.


For
additional information about Con Edison of New York's steam operations, see "Regulatory Matters—Steam" and "Results of Operations—Steam" in Item 7, the discussion of Con
Edison of New York's steam facilities in Item 2 and "Operating Statistics," below.

Steam Peak Load and Capacity.

Demand for steam in Con Edison of New York's service area peaks during the winter heating season. The
one-hour peak load during the winter of 2003/2004 (through January 31, 2004) occurred on January 16, 2004 when the load reached 10.1 million pounds (mlbs) per hour.
The company's estimate for the winter
of 2004/2005 peak demand of its steam customers is 10.5 mlbs per hour under design criteria, which assume severe weather.

On
December 31, 2003, the steam system had the capability of delivering about 12.6 mlbs of steam per hour. Con Edison of New York estimates that the system will have the capability to deliver
12.8 mlbs of steam per hour in the 2004/2005 winter.

Steam Supply.

52 percent of the steam sold by Con Edison of New York in 2003 was produced in the company's steam-only
generating stations; 36 percent was produced in the company's steam/electric generating stations, where it is first used to generate electricity; and 12 percent was purchased from
others. See Item 2 for a discussion of Con Edison of New York's steam facilities.

Regulation

The PSC regulates, among other things, Con Edison of New York's electric, gas and steam rates, the siting of its transmission lines and the issuance of its
securities. Certain activities of the company are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. In addition, various matters relating to the construction and operations of the company's facilities are
subject to regulation by other governmental agencies. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company. For additional information,
including information about the company's electric, gas and steam rates, see "Regulatory Matters" in Item 7.

The
PSC from time to time conducts "generic" proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Pending proceedings include those relating to
utilities exiting the business of selling electric energy and gas at retail (including an examination of utilities' provider of last resort responsibility and consumer protections); the State's goal
of increasing to 25 percent (from approximately 18 percent at the end of 2003) the portion of electricity used in the State provided from renewable energy resources; and addressing any
rate disincentives against the promotion of energy efficiency and distributed generation. The company typically is an active participant in such proceedings. The company does not expect that the
pending proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

Competition

Con Edison of New York is primarily a "wires and pipes" energy delivery company that:

•

has
sold most of its electric generating capacity;


•

provides
its customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas from other suppliers;

•

purchases
most of the electricity and all of the gas supplies it sells to its full-service customers (the cost of which is recovered pursuant to provisions
approved by the PSC); and

•

provides
energy delivery services to customers pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC.

See
"Rates and Restructuring Agreements" in Note B and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

The
company's electric, gas and steam rates are among the highest in the country.

Competition
from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as fuel cells and micro-turbines) may provide alternatives for Con Edison of New
York delivery customers. The company does not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service where the company already provides service.
Any such other company would need to obtain PSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements and install facilities to provide the service. The new company would also be subject to extensive
ongoing regulation by the PSC.

Capital Requirements and Financing

For information about Con Edison of New York's capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital
Resources, Capital Requirements and Financial and Commodity Market Risks" in Item 7.

Securities
ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at
any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Environmental Matters

Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenals (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of Con Edison of
New York and its predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored. See "Asbestos" and
"Superfund" in the discussion of Con Edison of New York's legal proceedings in Item 3 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.

Con
Edison of New York's capital expenditures for environmental protection facilities and related studies were $87 million in 2003 and are estimated to be $76 million in 2004.

In
April 2000, Con Edison of New York entered into a Stipulation and Order of Consent with the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in connection with its response to
the release of PCB's during the September 1998 transformer fire at the Arthur Kill Generating


Station
site that it sold in 1999. Among other things, the company agreed to maintain an effective environmental compliance program.

Toxic Substances Control Act.

Virtually all electric utilities, including Con Edison of New York, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are
regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.

Water Quality.

Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters
run through portions of Con Edison of New York's service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of
investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

The potential for adverse effects from global warming associated with the atmospheric release of greenhouse
gases (GHG), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), from industrial sources may result in legislation or regulations requiring utilities to reduce GHG emissions from power plants and take other steps to
offset GHG emissions from other sources. Con Edison of New York minimizes GHG emissions from its generating plants through the use of oil and gas fuels and the application of cogeneration technologies
that reduce GHG emissions per unit of energy output. The company's GHG emissions also include sulfur hexafluoride (used for arc suppression at substations) and methane (from operation of its gas
delivery system), which the company is working voluntarily with EPA to reduce. The cost to comply with any new legislation or regulations limiting the company's GHG emissions could be substantial.

Edison of New York has sold most of its electric generating assets. See Note J to the financial statements.


O&R

General Nature and Scope of Business

O & R, a subsidiary of Con Edison incorporated in New York State in 1926, has two wholly-owned utility subsidiaries, Rockland Electric Company (RECO), a
New Jersey corporation, and Pike County Light & Power Company (Pike), a Pennsylvania corporation.

O&R
and its utility subsidiaries provide electric service in southeastern New York and in adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania, an approximately 1,350 square mile service
area. They also provide gas service in southeastern New York and Pennsylvania. O&R's business is subject to regulation by the PSC, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission (PPUC) and the FERC. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to O&R could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

O&R's
principal business segments are its regulated electric and gas utility businesses. In 2003, electric and gas operating revenues were 73 percent and 27 percent, respectively, of its
operating revenues.

Competition

O&R is primarily a "wires and pipes" energy delivery company that:

•

has
sold its electric generating capacity;

•

provides
its customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas from other suppliers;

•

purchases
the electricity and gas it supplies to its full-service customers (the cost of which is recovered pursuant to provisions approved by the PSC, NJBPU or
PPUC); and

•

provides
energy delivery services to customers pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC.

See
"Rates and Restructuring Agreements" in Note B and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

Competition
from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as fuel cells and micro-turbines) may provide alternatives for O&R delivery customers. The company
does not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to
obtain the consent of the applicable state utility commission, satisfy applicable local requirements and install facilities to provide the service. The new company would also be subject to extensive
ongoing regulation by the applicable state utility commission.

For
additional information about O&R's business, see the discussion of O&R's results of operations in Item 7 and the notes to the financial statements in Item 8. For information about O&R's legal
proceedings, see Item 3.

CON EDISON OF NEW YORK

Electric Facilities

Generating Facilities.

Con Edison of New York's electric generating facilities consist of plants located in New York City with an aggregate
capacity of 630 MW. The company expects to have sufficient amounts of gas and fuel oil available in 2004 for use in these facilities. The company intends to add incremental generating capacity of
approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating (or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating) through the repowering of its East River station and the closing of its Waterside
station.

Transmission Facilities.

Con Edison of New York's transmission facilities, other than those located underground, are controlled and
operated by the NYISO. See "Electric Operations—Electric Supply" in Item 1 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). At December 31, 2003, Con Edison of New York's
transmission system had 432 miles of overhead circuits operating at 138, 230, 345 and 500 kV and 138 miles of underground circuits operating at 138 and 345 kV. There are 267 miles of radial
subtransmission circuits operating at 69 kV and above. The company's 14 transmission substations supplied by circuits operated at 69kV and above, have a total transformer capacity of 15,731 MVA. The
company's transmission facilities are located in New York City and Westchester, Orange, Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in New York State.

Con
Edison of New York has transmission interconnections with Niagara Mohawk, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation, O&R, New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, Connecticut Light


and
Power Company, Long Island Power Authority, NYPA and Public Service Electric and Gas Company.

Distribution Facilities.

Con Edison of New York owns various distribution substations and facilities located throughout New York City and
Westchester County. At December 31, 2003, the company's distribution system had a transformer capacity of 24,400 MVA, with 32,840 miles of overhead distribution lines and 90,218 miles of
underground distribution lines.

Gas Facilities

Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to Con Edison of New York at various points in its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through
4,261 miles of mains and 374,622 service lines. The company owns a natural gas liquefaction facility and storage tank at its Astoria property in Queens, New York. The plant can store approximately
1,000 mdth of which a maximum of about 250 mdth can be withdrawn per day. The company has about 1,230 mdth of additional natural gas storage capacity at a field in upstate New York, owned and operated
by Honeoye Storage Corporation, a corporation 28.8 percent owned by Con Edison of New York.

Steam Facilities

Con Edison of New York generates steam for distribution at three steam/electric generating stations and five steam-only generating stations and
distributes steam to customers through approximately 87 miles of mains and 18 miles of service lines. For information about the planned repowering of the East River steam-electric station, see
"Electric Facilities—Generating Facilities," above.

O&R

Electric Transmission and Distribution Facilities

O&R and its utility subsidiaries, RECO and Pike, own, in whole or in part, transmission and distribution facilities which include 602 circuit miles of
transmission lines, 14 transmission substations (with a total transformer capacity of 3,762 MVA), 59 distribution substations (with a transformer capacity of 1,987 MVA), 93,536 in-service
line transformers, 5,120 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 2,688 miles of underground distribution lines.

Gas Facilities

O&R and Pike own their gas distribution systems, which include 1,805 miles of mains.

RECO & Pike Mortgages

Substantially all of the utility plant and other physical property of O&R's utility subsidiaries, RECO and Pike, is subject to the liens of the respective
indentures securing first mortgage bonds of each company.


UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries own interests of 1,668 MW of capacity in electric generating facilities, most of which use gas and/or oil as fuel. These
interests, the capitalized costs of which at December 31, 2003 amounted to $859 million (net of accumulated depreciation), are as follows:

Con
Edison Development's interest in these facilities amounts to 1,668 MW.

Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries are also engaged in two leasing transactions involving gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the
Netherlands. See Note K to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Con
Edison Communications' properties, the capitalized cost of which at December 31, 2003 amounted to $30 million (net of the impairment charge discussed in Note H to the
financial statements in Item 8, which information is incorporated herein by reference), are included in Con Edison's financial statements as non-utility property and construction work in
progress. The properties include network facilities and nearly 400 miles of fiber optic cable that has been installed in the New York City metropolitan area primarily through Con Edison of New York
underground conduits and other rights of way. Con Edison Communication's pays a fee for the use of such conduits and rights of way.


ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

CON EDISON

Northeast Utilities

For information about legal proceedings relating to Con Edison's October 1999 agreement to acquire Northeast Utilities, see Note Q to the
financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Newington Project

For a description of the Newington Project, see Note T to the financial statements included in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by
reference). In September 2002, Duke/Fluor Daniel, the general contractor for the Newington Project, initiated an arbitration proceeding with
respect to its contract claims for an additional payment to it of approximately $100 million for alleged project costs and a 176-day extension of the project's scheduled substantial
completion date. In September 2002, the general contractor commenced an action in Superior Court in the State of New Hampshire, and obtained a pre-judgment attachment on the project
as security for the payment of its claim for additional project costs. The New Hampshire Superior Court subsequently ruled that the attachment was impermissible and ordered it to be removed. This
ruling has been stayed pending an appeal before the New Hampshire Supreme Court.

CON EDISON OF NEW YORK

Nuclear Generation

In February 2004, the PSC approved the December 2003 settlement among Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties regarding the
PSC proceeding investigating a February 2000 to January 2001 outage of the nuclear generating unit the company sold in 2001, its causes and the prudence of Con Edison of New York's
actions regarding the operation and maintenance of the generating unit. The proceeding covered, among other things, Con Edison of New York's inspection practices, the circumstances surrounding prior
outages, the basis for the company's decisions concerning replacement of the unit's steam generators and whether, and to what extent, increased replacement power costs and repair and replacement costs
should be borne by Con Edison's shareholders. Pursuant to the settlement, the company will refund $45.5 million to its customers and provide $2.5 million to fund one or more energy
efficiency programs for its low-income customers. In 2000, the company accrued a $40 million liability for possible refund to customers in connection with this proceeding. In
addition, under the settlement, the company will forego recovery of $89.5 million of replacement power costs that the company had incurred in 2000 but not billed to customers and as to which no
customer account receivable or regulatory asset was established and no income previously recognized. The settlement reduced 2003 net income by $8 million ($5 million after tax).

Asbestos

For information about legal proceedings relating to exposure to asbestos, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is
incorporated herein by reference).


Plaintiff
has agreed with Con Edison of New York to settle for $350,000 the action in New York State Supreme Court, New York County, entitled Robert Croteau v. A.C.& S., Inc. et al. In
March 2003, the jury in this action awarded plaintiff $47 million for asbestos-related injuries. The plaintiff was employed by a subcontractor who did work in the 1970s on two power
plants being constructed for Con Edison of New York.

Superfund

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several
liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites at which Con Edison of New York has been asserted to
have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies' former manufactured gas sites, its Astoria PCB storage facility, the Arthur Kill Generating Station site that it sold in 1999
and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims
against the company under Superfund, including with respect to its manufactured gas sites, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and
remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites.

Con Edison of New York and its predecessors formerly manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for
manufactured gas at sites in New York City and Westchester County, New York (MGP Sites). Many of these sites are now owned by parties other than Con Edison of New York and have been redeveloped by
them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is requiring the company to investigate
and, if necessary to protect public health and the environment from any MGP-related contamination that may be present at them, and to develop and implement remediation programs for the MGP
Sites, which include 33 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites.

The
information available to Con Edison of New York for most of the MGP Sites is incomplete as to the extent of contamination and remediation and monitoring methods, if any, to be used. Investigation
at most of the MGP Sites has not yet started and has been completed at only two of the MGP Sites. Coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants have been detected at
12 MGP Sites, including sites in Manhattan and other parts of New York City and in Westchester County.

Astoria Site.

Con Edison of New York is permitted by the DEC to operate a PCB storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria
section of Queens, New York. Apart from the PCB storage facility, portions of the property were the former location of an MGP and have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric
generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its DEC permit, the
company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found, and where necessary, to conduct corrective action to remediate the contamination. The company has
investigated various sections of the property, but has not yet begun investigating


the
former MGP area. The company has submitted to the DEC and the New York State Department of Health a report identifying the known areas of PCB contamination. The company estimates that its
undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of the known PCB contamination on the property will be at least $19 million.

Arthur Kill Transformer Site.

Following a September 1998 transformer fire at Con Edison of New York's former Arthur Kill Generating
Station, it was determined that oil containing high levels of PCBs was released to the environment during the incident. The company has completed DEC-approved cleanup programs for the
station's facilities and various soil and pavement areas of the site affected by the PCB release. Pursuant to a July 1999 DEC consent order, the company completed a DEC-approved
Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Program to assess the nature and extent of the contamination in, and to recommend a proposed remediation program for, the waterfront area of the station. DEC has
selected the remediation program for the waterfront area and the company will implement it pursuant to an additional consent order expected to be entered into during 2004. The company estimates that
its undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of PCB contamination at the site will be at least $3.5 million. See "Con Edison of New York—Environmental Matters" in
Item 1.

Other Superfund Sites.

Con Edison of New York is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to other Superfund sites where there
are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites.
Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites has been, and is expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is
reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

The
following table lists each of Con Edison of New York's other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the
year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in table under "Start"), the name of the court or agency in which
proceedings with respect to the site are pending, and the company's current estimate of its potential liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring and environmental damages at the site or
the unpaid share of any payments it is required to make under a settlement agreement resolving its liability for the site.

Washington Heights Power Outage

Lawsuits relating to a July 1999 interruption of electric service to customers served by Con Edison of New York's Washington Heights distribution network
were brought in New York State Supreme and Civil Courts, New York County. A number of cases, including purported class action lawsuits, have been dismissed, discontinued or settled for

de minimis

amounts. At December 31, 2003, 14 cases relating to the outage were pending, including suits by the New York City Transit Authority
seeking $20 million and by Columbia University and New York and Presbyterian Hospital seeking $23 million. The company does not expect that the remaining cases will have a material
adverse effect on its financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

Superfund

The sites at which O&R has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites, its West Nyack site and other Superfund sites
discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the company under
Superfund, including with respect to its manufactured gas sites, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery
from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

Manufactured Gas Sites.

O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in
Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Four of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, three of which have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses.
The DEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites.

O&R
has investigated and detected soil and/or groundwater contamination to varying degrees at all of the O&R MGP Sites. In November 2002, O&R initiated an Interim Remedial Measure at one MGP
site that is currently 80% complete. In addition, the DEC has developed a proposed remedial action plan for another O&R MGP site that will be distributed for comment in 2004. Additional investigation
and determination of the remediation and monitoring methods will be required at the other O&R MGP Sites.

West Nyack Site.

In 1994 and 1997, O&R entered into consent orders with the DEC pursuant to which O&R agreed to conduct a remedial
investigation and remediate certain property it owns in West Nyack, New York at which PCBs were discovered. Petroleum contamination related to a leaking


underground
storage tank was found as well. O&R has completed all remediation at the site that the DEC has required to date. The DEC is expected to determine whether any additional groundwater
remediation will be required.

Other Superfund Sites.

O&R is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site
investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these
sites has been, and is expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will
be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

The
following table lists each of O&R's other Superfund Sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the
company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in table under "Start"), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with
respect to the site are pending and the company's current estimate of its potential liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring and environmental damages at the site.

Con Edison of New York provides electric service to over 3.1 million customers and gas service to 1.1 million customers in New York City and
Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in
southeastern New York and adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania.

The
Utilities are primarily "wires and pipes" energy delivery companies that are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Pursuant to restructuring agreements, the Utilities have sold most
of their electric generating capacity and provide their customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas directly from other suppliers through the Utilities' retail access programs. The Utilities
supply more than half of the energy delivered by them in their service areas and provide delivery service to their customers that buy energy from other suppliers. The Utilities purchase substantially
all of the energy they supply to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they
incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers, pursuant to approved rate plans.

Con
Edison anticipates that the Utilities will provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities' earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility
service and the Utilities' ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital.

Demand
for utility service is affected by weather, economic conditions and other factors. The Utilities have experienced increased customer demand in recent years. In June, July and August of 2002,
both Con

Edison
of New York and O&R set new three-month electric delivery records of more than 17 million and 1.7 million megawatt hours, respectively. In June 2003, Con Edison of New York
and O&R each experienced a new record electric peak load for that month. The June peak was an all-time peak electric load for O&R. In January 2004, Con Edison of New York and O&R
each experienced a new winter electricity peak load.

Because
the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities' capital investment plans reflect in great part actual growth
in electric peak load adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak loads. On this basis, Con Edison of New York's weather-adjusted peak load in the summer of 2003
was 12,600 MW, 1.6 percent higher than the adjusted peak load in 2002. The forecast annual growth in the electric peak load over the next five years is 1.6 percent. The company anticipates an ongoing
need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this load growth with the exceptionally high level of reliability that it currently provides (see "Capital Requirements," below).

The
Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New York has an electric rate agreement (approved in
November 2000) that ends March 2005 and gas and steam rate agreements (approved in April 2002 and November 2000, respectively) that end in September 2004. These
agreements do not reflect all of the increased construction expenditures and related costs incurred and expected to be incurred to meet increasing customer demand and reliability needs that have been
experienced since the date of those agreements (see "Capital Requirements," below). The company filed petitions in November 2003 to increase rates for gas and steam service effective
October 2004 and expects to file a petition in April 2004 to increase rates for electric service effective April 2005. O&R has rate agreements for its electric and gas
services in New York that extend through October 2006. The rate plans generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on equity. Changes
in energy sales and delivery volumes are reflected in operating income (except to the extent that weather-normalization provisions apply to the gas businesses). Rates charged to customers, pursuant to
these agreements, may not be changed during the respective terms of these agreements other than for recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. See "Regulatory Matters" below and
"Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements.

Accounting
rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," pursuant to
which the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies," below.

The
respective collective bargaining agreements covering about two-thirds of each of the Utilities' employees expire in June 2004.

Unregulated Businesses

Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries participate in competitive businesses and are subject to different risks than the Utilities. In view of conditions
affecting certain of its competitive activities, the company recognized impairment charges of $159 million ($94 million after-tax) for its unregulated telecommunications and
generation businesses in the fourth quarter of 2003. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies," below and Note H to the financial statements. At December 31, 2003, Con Edison's
investment in its unregulated subsidiaries was $703 million and the unregulated subsidiaries' assets amounted to $1.6 billion, including $339 million related to Con Edison
Development's Newington project. See Note T to the financial statements.

Consolidated
Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity and gas to delivery customers of Con Edison of New York, O&R and other utilities and also offers energy related
services. As of December 31, 2003, the company served approximately 30,000 electric customers with an estimated aggregate peak load of 1,400 MW.

Consolidated
Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development) owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects. At December 31, 2003, the company owned
interests of 1,668 MW of capacity in electric generating facilities of which 244 MW are sold under long-term purchase power agreements and the balance is sold on the wholesale electricity
markets.

Consolidated
Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy) provides energy and capacity to Con Edison Solutions and others and markets the output of plants owned or operated by Con Edison
Development. The company also provides risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development and offers these services to others.

Con
Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications) builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The company's properties (the capitalized cost of which at
December 31, 2003 amounted to $30 million, net of the impairment charge discussed above and in Note H to the financial statements) include network facilities and nearly 400 miles
of fiber optic cable that has been installed in the New York City metropolitan area primarily through Con Edison of New York's underground conduits and other rights of way. Con Edison is evaluating
strategic alternatives for its telecommunications business.

Con
Edison anticipates investing $59 million in its unregulated businesses over the next two years and will focus on maximizing the value of their existing assets. See "Capital Requirements"
and "Capital Resources," below.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Companies' financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The Companies' critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement
benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases.

The
critical accounting policies are as follows:

Accounting
for Regulated Public Utilities—SFAS No. 71

The Utilities are subject to SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, are
subject to the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.

SFAS
No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be
accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will
be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in
the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No. 71.

The
Utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory
assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory
assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.

Accounting
for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries
also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including
assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends and appropriate discount rates. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about these
assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2003, 2002 and 2001.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

Primarily
because of the amortization of previous years' net investment gains, Con Edison of New York's pension expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in
net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period (20 percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to
amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20 percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement
of Policy issued by the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No. 87.

The
cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets and assumptions for future periods. Con Edison's current estimate for 2004 is a
reduction, compared with 2003, in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of $19 million after tax for Con Edison of New York and an increase, compared to 2003, in pension and
other postretirement benefits expense of $1 million for O&R. This reduction reflects, among other factors, the amortization of prior period actuarial losses associated with declines in the
market value of assets in recent years, partially offset by the amortization of a gain on plan assets in 2003 and by the estimated impact in 2004 of recently enacted Medicare legislation (reduction in
other postretirement benefit costs of $10 million after tax, including $9 million for Con Edison of New York and $1 million for O&R).

Amortization
of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce Con Edison of New York's pension and other post retirement benefit net credit by an additional
$25 million, after tax, in 2005. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2004 as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.8 percent would change
net income for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by approximately $5 million in 2005, assuming no change in regulatory treatment.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 71 and consistent with rate provisions approved by the PSC, O&R defers as a regulatory asset any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and
the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses. Con Edison of New York's pending petitions for gas and steam rate increases include, and the company anticipates that its petition for an electric
rate
increase will include, a proposal for deferred accounting treatment of such expenses. See "Regulatory Matters", below.

Pension
benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the unregulated subsidiaries make contributions for their participating
employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. An actuarial valuation of the plan's funded status as of December 31, 2003, showed that the fair value of
the plan's assets exceeded, by $712 million, the plan's accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at that date. However, the fair market value of the plan assets could fall below the plan's ABO in
future years. In that event, each of the Utilities would be required, under SFAS No. 87, to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between its share of the fair value of the plan
assets and its portion of the ABO, plus, in the case of Con Edison of


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

New
York, its total prepaid pension costs, through a non-cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect net income for
common stock.

The
Companies were not required to make cash contributions to their pension plans in 2003 under funding regulations and tax laws. O&R made a discretionary contribution of $18 million to the
plan in 2003. In 2004, O&R and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries expect to make discretionary contributions of $22 million and $2 million, respectively. The Companies' policy is to
fund its accounting cost to the extent it is tax deductible.

Accounting
for Contingencies

SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss
that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies include the Utilities' responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos,
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations, workers' compensation claims and Con Edison's legal proceedings relating to its
October 1999 merger agreement with Northeast Utilities. See Notes G, K, Q, R, S, T and W to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, the Companies have accrued estimates
of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be
reasonably estimated.

Accounting
for Long-Lived Assets

SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" requires that certain long-lived assets must be
tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No. 144 an impairment loss is recognized if
the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.

The
adverse market conditions affecting Con Edison's unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses led to the testing of their assets for impairment in 2003. A critical element of this test
is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long-lived assets. Forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations, which are
particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the energy-related and telecommunications businesses. Under SFAS No. 144, if alternative courses of action are under
consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows, the probability of those possible outcomes must be weighted. As a result of the tests performed in 2003, Con
Edison recognized impairment charges of $159 million


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

($94 million
after-tax) for the assets of its unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses. See Note H to the financial statements.

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments

The Companies apply SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements
to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale
of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Financial and Commodity Market Risks" below and Note P to the financial statements.

Accounting
for Goodwill

Con Edison adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. In accordance with this standard, Con Edison ceased
amortizing goodwill and began testing remaining goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis. Con Edison completed initial goodwill impairment tests and recorded a loss of $34.1 million
($20.2 million after tax) as of January 1, 2002, relating to certain generation assets owned by an unregulated subsidiary. The unamortized goodwill of $405.8 million, relating to
the acquisition of O&R, was tested for impairment and determined not to be impaired. See Note L to the financial statements.

In
determining whether or not its goodwill is impaired, Con Edison is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the results of the goodwill impairment test. Actual results
could differ from the estimates used.

Accounting
for Leases

The Companies apply SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases" and other related accounting pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Notes K and T to
the financial statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Companies' liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash
flows and as discussed below.

The
principal factors affecting Con Edison's liquidity at the holding company level are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from
the Utilities. In addition, in 2003 Con Edison issued 11.9 million shares of common stock for $431 million ($381 million of which it invested in Con Edison of New York) and
$200 million of five-year debt. In 2002, the company issued $325 million of 40-year debt (most of which it invested in its unregulated subsidiaries).

The
principal factors affecting the Utilities' liquidity are the cash flow generated from operations, construction expenditures and maturities of their debt securities. In addition, Con Edison of New
York in 2003 received a $381 million capital contribution from Con Edison; in 2002 and 2001 issued $225 million and $95 million, respectively, of additional debt net of
redemptions; and in 2001 received

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

net
proceeds of $597 million from the sale of generating assets, net of a contribution to its nuclear decommissioning trust (see Note J to the financial statements). Also, since 2001,
Con Edison of New York has incurred substantial, primarily capital, costs in connection with the attack on the World Trade Center and the subsequent restoration of lower Manhattan and to date has
received reimbursement of such costs of $29 million from the federal government (see Note R to the financial statements). In 2003, O&R redeemed $35 million of debt at maturity
with commercial paper.

The
Companies each believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements, assuming that the Utilities' rate plans reflect their
costs of service, including a return on invested capital. See "Regulatory Matters," below and "Application of Critical Accounting Policies—Accounting for Contingencies," above.

Changes
in the Companies' cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are summarized as

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities

The Utilities' cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and
deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as weather and economic conditions. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in
accordance with rate plans approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction—the PSC, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission (PPUC). See "Regulatory Matters" below. In general, changes in the Utilities' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income
because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements.

Net
income for common stock is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies' cash flows from operating activities. Principal
non-cash charges include depreciation and deferred taxes, and for Con Edison in 2003, impairment charges. For Con Edison of New York, principal non-cash credits include prepaid
pension costs. Pension credits result from past favorable performance in Con Edison of New York's pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See "Application of Critical Accounting
Policies—Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" and Notes E and F to the financial statements.

Net
cash flows from operating activities in 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $203 million and $141 million lower than 2002, respectively. This decrease reflects lower
net income at Con Edison of New York (due to a certain extent to costs not reflected in current rates) and for Con Edison (due to greater losses at the unregulated subsidiaries). This decrease also
reflects Con Edison of New York's increase in the value of gas in storage (reflecting both higher unit costs and higher volumes) and a higher level of accrued construction commitments at
year-end 2002 that were paid for in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deferred income tax expense.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

Net
cash flows from operating activities in 2003 for O&R were $24 million higher than in 2002 due primarily to increased deferred income tax expense, partially offset by the increased value of
gas in storage (resulting from higher unit costs and volumes).

Net
cash flows from operating activities in 2002 for Con Edison were $65 million lower than in 2001. This decrease was due principally to higher energy costs and sales at the Utilities in
December 2002 as compared with December 2001, resulting in increased customer accounts receivable and recoverable energy costs, offset in part by increased accounts payable balances. The
net benefit to cash flows from these activities in 2001 was greater than the benefit in 2002 because high energy costs at year-end 2000 were collected in 2001 and energy purchases at
year-end 2001 were lower than the prior year. The change in cash flows also reflects the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds for the Utilities and net cash received related
to regulatory liabilities, such as transmission congestion contracts, offset by increased cash expended related to regulatory assets.

Net
cash flows from operating activities in 2002 for Con Edison of New York were $4 million higher than in 2001. The change in cash flows reflects the aforementioned impact of the timing of
energy sales and cost recovery, the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds, and cash received or expended related to regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets, respectively.

Cash
Flows Used in Investing Activities

Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $107 million lower in 2003 than in 2002, due primarily to lower construction expenditures
by its unregulated subsidiaries, partially offset by increased construction expenditures by the Utilities. Cash flows used in investing activities were $64 million and $11 million higher
in 2003 than in 2002 for Con Edison of New York and O&R, respectively, due primarily to increased construction expenditures.

Net
cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $693 million and $704 million higher in 2002 compared with 2001, respectively, due primarily to
the receipt in 2001 of net proceeds from generation divestiture. See Note J to the financial statements. In addition, Con Edison of New York construction expenditures increased in 2002 compared
with 2001, principally to meet load growth on the company's electric distribution system, to effect permanent restoration of portions of the electric, gas and steam systems in lower Manhattan
following the World Trade Center attack and for the ongoing project to add incremental generating capacity at Con Edison of New York's East River steam-electric generating plant (the East River
Repowering Project).

Deferred
real estate sale costs related to the demolition and remediation of a nine-acre development site in midtown Manhattan along the East River were $134 million at
December 31, 2002, compared with $105 million at December 31, 2001. In 2000, Con Edison of New York agreed to sell this site for an expected price of $576 million to
$680 million, depending on zoning and other adjustments. The sale is subject to PSC approval and other conditions. The buyer paid Con Edison of New York $50 million in

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

as a down payment, which Con Edison used to fund a portion of the demolition and remediation expenses. The down payment has been recorded as a regulatory liability.

Net
cash flows used in investing activities for O&R were $1 million lower in 2002 than in 2001.

Cash
Flows from/(used in) Financing Activities

Net cash flows from financing activities in 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased $258 million and $327 million, respectively
in 2003 compared with 2002.

Con
Edison's cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, reflect the issuance of 9.6 million Con Edison common shares (resulting in proceeds of
$381 million, which was invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York) and $200 million of Con Edison's 3.625 percent 5-year Series 2003A Debentures (most of
which was invested in the unregulated subsidiaries). Cash flows from financing activities in 2002 reflect the issuance of $325 million of Con Edison's 7.25 percent 40-year
Series 2002A Debentures (the proceeds of which were used to repay commercial paper). Cash flows from financing activities in both 2003 and 2002 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common
shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2003: 2.3 million shares for $50 million; 2002: 1.7 million shares for $25 million). In addition, common
stock dividends paid in 2003 and 2002 were reduced by $46 million and $44 million, respectively, to reflect the amount of dividends reinvested in Con Edison common shares through the
dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans.

Net
cash flows used in financing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York decreased $267 million and $328 million in 2002 compared with 2001, respectively. This decrease
reflects principally increased debt financing for construction expenditures at Con Edison of New York and a reduction in the dividends paid by Con Edison of New York to Con Edison. In addition, in
September 2001, Con Edison of New York used the proceeds from the sale of its nuclear plant to repay outstanding short-term borrowing.

Net
cash flows used in financing activities for O&R were $8 million lower in 2002 than 2001, due primarily to the retirement of short-term debt in excess of proceeds from issuances.

Net
cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 also reflect Con Edison of New York's (unless otherwise noted) refunding and issuance of
long-term debt and preferred stock as follows:


•

Redeemed

Redeemed
at maturity $150 million variable rate 5-year Series 1996B.

In
2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6 million aggregate principal amount of its tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds,
Series 2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10-year term mode, callable at par after three years with a 4.7 percent annual interest rate. In addition, Con Edison of
New York entered into a swap agreement in connection with these bonds pursuant to which the company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate
of 5.375 percent. See Note P to the financial statements.

Cash
flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as "Notes payable"). The commercial paper amounts outstanding

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

Accounts receivable—customers, less allowance for uncollectible accounts increased due primarily to higher electric and gas sales revenue for the
Utilities and higher electric purchased power and gas unit costs (which are recoverable from customers) for Con Edison of New York during December 2003 compared with December 2002.
Energy sales and purchased power costs are discussed below under "Results of Operations."

Gas
in storage increased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 due primarily to higher unit costs and volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2003 as compared
with year-end 2002.

Prepaid
pension costs for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 due to the recognition of the current period's pension
credits.

Accounts
payable for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York decreased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 due primarily to a higher level of accrued construction
commitments at year-end 2002. This decrease was offset in part by increased electric purchased power costs for Con Edison of New York at December 31, 2003 as compared with
year-end 2002, reflecting higher unit costs.

Superfund
and other environmental liabilities for the Companies increased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 reflecting increased estimates for investigation,
removal and remediation costs.

Deferred
income taxes—liability increased at December 31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 due primarily to accelerating tax deductions for capitalized indirect
costs.

Transmission
congestion contracts (See "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" in Note B to the financial statements) increased at December 31, 2003 compared with year-end 2002
reflecting
proceeds from the sale through the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) of transmission rights on Con Edison of New York's transmission system. These proceeds are being retained for customer
benefit.

Capital
Resources

Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison
expects to finance its capital requirements primarily from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and through the sale of securities, including commercial paper. In addition, Con Edison's ability
to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its
interests in its subsidiaries.

For
information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements.

For
information on the Companies' commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

The
Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings.

In
December 2001, the PSC authorized the Utilities to issue up to $1.95 billion of debt securities prior to 2006, of which Con Edison of New York issued $195 million and
$525 million of debt securities in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, the PSC authorized the refunding of the Utilities' outstanding debt securities and preferred stock.

Con
Edison's unregulated subsidiaries have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings.
See Note T to the financial statements.

In
August 2002, Congress appropriated funds for which Con Edison of New York is eligible to apply, to recover costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. In accordance
with procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds, Con Edison of New York submitted its initial application for funds in October 2003 and received the first installment of
$29 million on October 31, 2003. The Company will submit additional applications when appropriate. See Note R to the financial statements.

For
each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was:

Con Edison of New York's utility construction expenditures in 2003 and 2004 reflect programs to meet electric load growth and reliability needs, gas
infrastructure expenditures, the East River Repowering Project and expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the World Trade Center attack (see Note R to
the financial statements). The increase for 2005 reflects an anticipated higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution
system.

The
unregulated subsidiaries' construction expenditures declined in 2003 and are expected to continue to decline, consistent with there being no major construction or acquisition expected for those
businesses. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Con Edison's investment balance in these subsidiaries, on an unconsolidated basis, was $703 million and $790 million, respectively.

Contractual

Other
purchase obligations for the Utilities exclude amounts included in other contractual obligations shown on the table. Amounts shown for purchase obligations were derived from the
Utilities' purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For most of its other purchase obligations, the
Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized, typically a 10 percent commitment. These other purchase obligations reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs
entered into by the Utilities in running their day to day operations. Payments of the other purchase obligations are assumed to be made ratably over the terms of the obligations.

(b)

Represents
commitments to purchase electric energy and capacity, natural gas and natural gas pipeline capacity and operation and maintenance generation service agreements entered into
by Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

The
Companies' commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments are their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets and Con Edison's guarantees of certain
obligations of its subsidiaries. See Notes S and T to the financial statements.

Electric
Power Requirements

In 2003, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others and through the NYISO's
wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2004.

In
general, the Utilities recover prudently incurred purchase power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See "Financial and
Commodity Market Risks—Commodity Price Risk" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to
review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

To
reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy (including the output of the nuclear generating unit divested in 2001) and have entered
into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of expected purchases, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in the summer of 2004. See
Notes I and P to the financial statements. O&R's New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to
its customers in 2004. Con Edison of New York also owns approximately 630 MW of generating stations associated primarily with its steam system, located in New York City, the electricity output of
which it sells through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market.

The
East River Repowering Project will add incremental electric capacity of approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating. In a
July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers
"overly broad" and did not adopt Con Edison of New York's request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in
long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of
capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource
adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO.

Con
Edison's unregulated subsidiaries sell electricity in the wholesale and retail NYISO and other markets. At December 31, 2003, Con Edison Development's interests in electric generating
facilities amounted to 1,668 MW. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities under

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

contract
or on the wholesale electricity markets. See "Financial and Commodity Market Risks—Commodity Price Risk," below.

REGULATORY MATTERS

For additional information about the electric, gas and steam agreements discussed below, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note B to the
financial statements.

Electric

In July 2002, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to establish a Standard Market Design (SMD) for wholesale electricity markets across the
country. The proposed SMD has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the Northeast, and if adopted, could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country.
After receiving over 1,000 comments on the proposals contained in its SMD NOPR, the FERC issued its Wholesale Market Platform "White Paper" on April 28, 2003. The White Paper built on the
existing rules contained in Order 2000. Key among the attributes discussed in the White Paper are flexibility on the scope and configuration to allow for both Independent System Operators (ISOs) and
Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs); the need for a regional planning process; the need for rate mechanisms that minimize cost shifts; the need to eliminate "seams" charges between ISOs and
RTOs; the use of a real-time market for energy to resolve imbalances; and the need for an approach to manage congestion, which could include locational pricing with firm transmission
rights, that protects against manipulation, utilizes the grid effectively and promotes the use of lower cost generation. In addition, each region within an RTO or ISO will determine how it will ensure
that its region has sufficient resources to meet customers' needs. Since releasing its White Paper, the FERC has held technical conferences on various issues. However, it has not issued any specific
orders for compliance. The energy bill introduced in Congress in 2003 contained a provision remanding SMD to the FERC and requiring that no new rule could be issued before October 31, 2006 or
could become effective before December 31, 2006. The energy bill was not passed in 2003. The Senate leadership has stated its intent to bring the bill up for vote again in 2004.

In
September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997
Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates on an annual basis by $129 million in 1998, $80 million in 1999, $103 million in 2000 and
$209 million in 2001, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to be served by competitive energy suppliers.

In
November 2000, the PSC approved an October 2000 agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the
1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture-related issues.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

The
electric rate plan provisions of the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement cover the five-year period ending March 2005. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New
York reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000.

The
2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable
Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements.

O&R
has entered into settlement agreements or similar arrangements with the PSC, NJBPU and PPUC that provide for a transition to a competitive electric market.

In
October 2003, the PSC approved agreements among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The
electric agreement, which covers the period from July 1, 2003 through October 31, 2006, provides for no changes to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and
offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a
total of $11 million (pre-tax) between July 2003 and June 2006. During the second half of 2003, O&R amortized $3.7 million of the $11 million. The
agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of a 12.75 percent return on common
equity during the three year period from July 2003 through June 2006. The period from July 2006 through October 2006 will not be subject to earnings sharing.

In
July 2003, the NJBPU ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), the New Jersey utility subsidiary of O&R, for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred
purchased power costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements—Electric" in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements. The NJBPU ordered a
$7 million decrease in RECO's electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECO's recovery of approximately $83 million of previously deferred purchased power costs and
associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19 million of such costs and associated interest. At December 31, 2002, the company had accrued a reserve for
$13 million of the disallowance, and at June 30, 2003 reserved an additional $6 million for the disallowance.

Gas

In November 2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for gas service by $108 million (9.8 percent),
effective October 2004.

Con
Edison of New York is currently operating under a gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April 2002. The Agreement covers the three-year period ending September 30,
2004. The rate agreement reduced retail sales and transportation rates by $25 million, on an annual basis.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

In
November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through
September 2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September 1996 levels through September 2000.

In
October 2003, the PSC approved an agreement among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for gas service. The O&R gas
agreement, which covers the period from November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2006, provides for annual increases in gas base rates of $9 million (5.8 percent) effective
November 2003, $9 million (4.8 percent) effective November 2004 and $5 million (2.5 percent) effective November 2005. The O&R gas agreement also
continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs
from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11 percent return on common equity over the term of the agreement. The agreement also
contains incentives under which, among other things, the company earns additional amounts based on attaining specified targets for customer migration to its retail access programs and the achievement
of certain net revenue targets for interruptible sales and transportation customers.

In
November 2000, the PSC also approved a gas rate agreement between O&R, PSC Staff and certain other parties covering the three-year period November 2000 through
October 2003.

Steam

In November 2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase annual charges for steam service by $129 million
(14.6 percent), effective October 2004.

Con
Edison of New York is currently operating under a steam rate agreement that was approved by the PSC in December 2000. The agreement provided for a $16.6 million steam rate increase,
which took effect October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, provided for no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004.

FINANCIAL AND COMMODITY MARKET RISKS

The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest
rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.

Interest
Rate Risk

The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction
expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate-debt with varying maturities
and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2003, each 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to the Companies'


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

variable
rate debt of $816 million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $1 million. For each 10 percent change in Con Edison of New York's and O&R's variable
interest rates applicable to their variable rate debt of $714 million and $59 million, respectively, annual interest expense for Con Edison of New York would change by $1 million
and there would be no material impact for O&R.

In
addition, Con Edison and its subsidiaries, from time to time, enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in
Note P to the financial statements.

Commodity
Price Risk

Con Edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con
Edison's unregulated subsidiaries have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note P to the financial statements.

Con
Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2003, each 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $12 million for the derivative instruments
used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $8 million is for Con Edison of New York and $4 million for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair
value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally
recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative
instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements.

Con
Edison's unregulated subsidiaries use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales
commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a
specified time period and confidence level. The unregulated subsidiaries estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with
a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of
future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2003,
and 2002, respectively, was as follows:

Credit
Risk

The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to over-the-counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply
and hedging activities by the Utilities and the unregulated energy subsidiaries. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty's nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies
to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements. The Companies measure
credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions
represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff.

Con
Edison's unregulated energy subsidiaries had $71 million of credit exposure, net of collateral and reserves, at December 31, 2003, of which $63 million was with investment
grade counterparties and $8 million was with the New York Mercantile Exchange or independent system operators.

Investment
Risk

The Companies' investment risk relates to the investment of the assets of their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Application of Critical
Accounting Policies—Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above. The Companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of
65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2003, the pension plan investments consisted of 64 percent equity and
36 percent fixed income and other securities. See Note E to the financial statements.

ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES

Unregulated subsidiaries of Con Edison engage in energy trading activities that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. See Note P to the financial statements.

Prior
to October 2002, these contracts were accounted for under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and
Risk Management Activities." As of October 2002, energy and energy-related trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS No. 133. Such contracts
are marked to market with gains and losses recognized in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, Con Edison recognized in income net unrealized pre-tax losses of
$3 million and $1 million, respectively, excluding the effect of a cumulative adjustment due to a change in accounting principle. Contracts that did not fall within the scope of SFAS
No. 133 were included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recognized in December 2002. See Note P to the financial statements.

"Prices
based on models and other valuation methods" represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from
external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based on underlying contractual terms. The models reflect
management's estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk-free market discount rate, volatility
factors, estimated correlations of energy commodity prices and contractual volumes. Counterparty specific credit quality, market price uncertainty and other risks are also factored into the models.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to
asbestos, see Note G to the financial statements.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

IMPACT OF INFLATION

The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through
depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the asset upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The
impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies'
prices change by more or less than
inflation, the real price of the Companies' services will increase or decline. Over the past 20 years, for example, the real price of electric service has declined substantially.

MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES

For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies' material contingencies, see "Application of Critical Accounting
Policies—Accounting for Contingencies," above.

*Represents the consolidated financial results of Con Edison and its subsidiaries.

A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note O to the
financial statements.

The
results reflect the application of the Companies' accounting policies and rate plans that cover the rates the Utilities can charge their customers. In general, the Utilities recover on a current
basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A and "Regulatory Matters" in
Note B to the financial statements.

CON EDISON OF NEW YORK

Electric

Con Edison of New York's electric operating revenues increased $559 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to higher fuel and purchased power
costs of $503 million (which are recoverable

from
customers), and a lower amount reserved for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return to be retained for customer benefit ($31 million). Changes to operating revenues also reflect
variations in electric sales.

Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New York's service area decreased 0.4 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in delivery volumes
reflects the cool weather in the second quarter of 2003 and the lower than normal number of hot days during the summer of 2003 compared with an exceptionally warm summer in 2002, partially offset by
the cold winter weather in 2003 compared with the mild winter in 2002. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power
outage, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New York's service area increased 0.6 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Weather-adjusted sales represent an estimate of the sales that would
have been made if historical average weather conditions had prevailed.

Con
Edison of New York's electric purchased power costs increased $477 million in 2003 as compared with 2002, due to an increase in the average unit price of purchased power. This increase was
offset in part by lower usage by the company's full service customers and higher volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the company's retail access programs. Electric
fuel costs increased $26 million, reflecting an increase in the average unit price of fuel.

Con
Edison of New York's electric operating income decreased $1 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The principal component of the decrease was an increase in other operations and maintenance
expense ($41 million—due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), property taxes ($17 million) and depreciation
($16 million). The increase in expenses was offset in part


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

by
higher net revenues (operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs—$56 million), lower state and local revenue taxes ($7 million), sales and use tax
($5 million) and payroll taxes ($3 million).

Gas

Con Edison of New York's gas operating revenues in 2003 increased $250 million compared with 2002, due primarily to the higher cost of purchased gas of
$244 million (which is recoverable from customers), and higher sales volumes.

Con
Edison of New York's revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income.

Con Edison of New York's sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 13.8 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflects the
impact of the cold weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period and increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and
billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the company's service area increased 3.6 percent in 2003.

Non-firm
transportation of customer-owned gas to NYPA and electric generating plants decreased 34.8 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to higher gas prices. In 2003, because
of the relative prices of gas and fuel oil, electric generating plants in the company's gas service area utilized oil rather

than
gas for a significant portion of their generation. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation.

Con
Edison of New York's purchased gas cost increased $244 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due to higher unit costs and increased sales volumes for firm sales customers.

Con
Edison of New York's gas operating income decreased $10 million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting primarily an increase in other operations and maintenance expense
($4 million—due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), depreciation ($4 million), state and local taxes on revenues
($5 million) and income tax ($4 million). The increases in expenses were offset in part by higher net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for
resale—$7 million).

Steam

Con Edison of New York's steam operating revenues increased $133 million and steam operating income decreased $1 million in 2003 compared with
2002. The higher revenues reflect higher sales volumes due to the cold winter weather in 2003 as compared with the mild weather in 2002. The increase also includes higher fuel and purchased power
costs ($124 million) in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in steam operating income reflects primarily higher income taxes ($10 million—due to higher taxable income and a
lower level of removal costs in 2003) and operations and maintenance expense ($3 million—due to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits) offset in part
by an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $9 million and lower state and local taxes on steam revenues ($4 million).

Effective January 2003, New York City increased Con Edison of New York's annual property taxes by $94 million. Under the company's rate
agreements, the company is deferring most of the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers.

Other
Income

Other income (deductions) decreased $19 million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting $27 million of interest income on a federal income tax
refund claim recorded in 2002, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense in 2003 as a result of the recognition in 2002 of income tax benefits relating to the September 2001 sale of
the company's nuclear generating unit.

Net
Interest Charges

Net interest charges decreased $16 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax
deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19 million) recorded in 2002.

Income
Taxes

Operating income taxes increased $18 million in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily as a result of less flow-through
(non-deferred) depreciation for tax purposes. In addition, lower operating income taxes in 2002 reflected a tax benefit from an Internal Revenue Service audit for tax years 1995 through
1997 and a write-off of excess deferred tax reserves.

O&R

Electric

Electric operating revenues increased $54 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher purchased power costs in 2003 and
accounting for the 2003 O&R electric rate agreement and the NJBPU ruling on the RECO rate petitions.

Electric delivery volumes in O&R's service area increased 1.0 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 due to the growth in the number of customers, higher
average customer usage, and the positive effect of the cooler-than-normal weather in the first quarter of 2003, partially offset by negative impact of weather on the last nine
months of 2003. After adjusting for weather variations and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in O&R's service area increased 2.5 percent in 2003.

O&R's
purchased power cost increased $31 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to an increase in the average unit cost and the regulatory actions referenced above. This increase was offset
by lower energy usage by the company's full-service customers and higher volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in O&R's retail access program.

O&R's
electric operating income decreased $6 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due primarily to the referenced regulatory actions.

Gas

O&R's gas operating revenues increased $38 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher cost of gas purchased for resale
in 2003, higher firm sales and transportation volumes and the impact of the 2003 gas rate agreement.

O&R's sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 13.9 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflects the impact of the cold
weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does
not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, total firm sales and
transportation volumes were 3.0 percent higher in 2003 compared with 2002.

Non-firm
transportation of customer-owned gas to electric generating plants decreased 79.7 percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to higher gas prices. In 2003, because of the
relative prices of gas and fuel oil, power plants in the company's gas service area utilized oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. In addition, one area power plant
completed a construction project to directly connect to a gas transmission provider. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local
transportation.

O&R's
cost of gas purchased for resale increased $31 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to increased sales to firm customers and increased gas unit costs in 2003. The increase is offset
in part
by increased volumes of gas purchased from other suppliers by participants in O&R's retail access program. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements.

Gas
operating income increased $2 million in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase reflects an increase in net gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) of $7 million,
which is due primarily to increased sales and the referenced regulatory actions. The increase in net revenues was offset in part by increased gas operations and maintenance expenses of
$2 million and increased federal and state income tax of $3 million.

Income
Taxes

Operating income taxes increased by $9 million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to the result of less flow-through
(non-deferred) depreciation for tax purposes.

Other
Income

O&R's other income (deductions) decreased $3 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to the reclassification to other income (deductions) of
losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income related to investments in marketable securities.

Net
Interest Charges

O&R's net interest charges decreased by $7 million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to the company recording interest charges of
$5 million in 2002 as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on the company's deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey and to lower interest on
long-term debt as a result of the redemption of a $35 million, 10-year debenture in March 2003 (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources," above).

UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER

Unregulated subsidiaries' operating income for 2003 was $122 million lower than 2002. Operating revenues increased $292 million in 2003 compared
with 2002 due primarily to higher sales from Con Edison Development's increased generating capacity and increased retail electric sales at Con Edison Solutions.

Unregulated
subsidiaries' operating expenses, excluding income taxes, increased by $502 million, reflecting principally increased fuel and purchased power costs of $260 million,
impairment charges
of $159 million and increased operation and maintenance expenses of $83 million. See Note H to the financial statements. The increase in operation and maintenance expenses was
attributable to increased costs at Con Edison Development ($51 million), primarily to operate the new generation assets, Con Edison Communications' increased operating costs reflecting
expansion of the business ($23 million), and higher depreciation for additional telecommunications facilities and generating assets placed in service ($13 million), offset in part by
lower operation and maintenance costs at Con Edison Solutions ($6 million).

Operating
income taxes decreased $88 million for 2003 as compared with 2002 reflecting primarily lower taxable income (including the tax-effect of the aforementioned impairment
charges).

Unregulated
subsidiaries' other income (deductions) increased $1 million and interest charges were lower by $1 million for 2003 as compared with 2002.

Unregulated
subsidiaries' earnings reflect an increase of $25 million for 2003 as compared with 2002 resulting from the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles adopted in each
year. For 2003, the positive cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $3 million (after tax) at Con Edison Development related to mark-to-market gains
applicable to power sales contracts at certain generating plants, partially offset by the impact of the financial statement consolidation of its Newington plant. For 2002, the cumulative effect of
changes in accounting principles included charges for goodwill impairment of certain generating assets at Con Edison Development, totaling $20 million (after tax), and a charge of
$2 million (after tax) at Con Edison Energy relating to the accounting for certain contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities.

Earnings
attributable to Other, representing the parent company and inter-company transactions, were $9 million lower for 2003 as compared with 2002 primarily reflecting higher interest
expenses.

CON EDISON OF NEW YORK

Electric

Con Edison of New York's electric operating revenues in 2002 decreased $575 million compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower fuel and purchased
power costs of $227 million (discussed below). The decrease also reflects the completion in March 2002 of amortizations of a previously deferred gain on the sale of divested plants and a
previously deferred NYPA revenue increase ($43 million), a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer

benefit
in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement ($40 million), a reserve established in 2002 related to the sale of the company's nuclear generating unit ($25 million), the
amortization of the loss ($30 million) related to the sale of the company's nuclear generating unit and rate reductions and other amortizations in accordance with the company's rate agreements.
The decrease in electric operating revenues was offset, in part, by an increase in electric sales revenues ($24 million) reflecting principally the hot summer weather.

Electricity delivery volumes in Con Edison of New York's service territory increased 1.7 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects the
impact of the hot summer weather, offset in part by the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002, and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in
each period, electricity delivery volumes in the service territory increased 0.5 percent in 2002.

The
company's electric purchased power costs decreased $175 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to a decrease in the price of purchased power and an increase in volumes of electricity
purchased from other suppliers by participants in the retail access programs. This decrease was offset in part by the company's increased purchased volumes resulting from the sale of the company's
nuclear generating unit in September 2001 and the hot summer weather in 2002. Fuel costs decreased $52 million as a result of decreased generation at company-owned power plants. In
general, the company recovers prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC.

The
company's electric operating income decreased $93 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The principal component of the decrease was lower net electric revenues (operating revenues less fuel
and purchased power costs) of $348 million. The decrease in net electric revenues reflects the sale of the nuclear generation unit and the same factors (other than lower fuel and purchased
power costs) as


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

discussed
above with respect to the decrease in electric operating income. The decrease in net electric revenues was offset in part by reduced other operations and maintenance expenses
($137 million) reflecting nuclear production expenses incurred in 2001 but not in 2002, and productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization expense ($32 million) and lower
revenue taxes ($26 million). The decrease is also offset by lower operating income tax of $62 million.

Gas

Con Edison of New York's gas operating revenues decreased $223 million, resulting primarily from the lower cost of purchased gas ($194 million) in
2002 compared with 2001. The lower cost of purchased gas reflects primarily lower unit costs. The lower revenues also reflect reduced sales volumes, resulting primarily from the mild winter weather in
the first quarter of 2002, and revenue reductions implemented in accordance with the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April 2002. Gas operating income decreased $8 million in
2002, reflecting a $29 million decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale), and increased property tax expense ($10 million), offset in part by reduced
operations and maintenance expenses ($16 million), reduced revenue taxes ($10 million) and lower income taxes ($9 million).

adjusting
for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the company's service territory decreased 1.5 percent in the 2002.

The
company's gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. A weather-normalization provision that applies to the company's gas business
moderates, but does not completely eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on gas operating income.

Steam

Con Edison of New York's steam operating revenues decreased $100 million. The lower revenues reflect reduced sales volumes and lower fuel and purchased
power costs primarily as a result of the
loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. The lower fuel and purchased power costs reflect primarily lower unit costs and
volumes. Steam operating income increased $8 million for 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to reduced operations and maintenance expenses of $9 million and lower income taxes of
$11 million, offset in part by a decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $11 million.

Other
Income

Investment income decreased $4 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due principally to reduced interest income earned on short-term cash
investments in 2002 compared with 2001. For 2001, the company had more cash on hand than in 2002, primarily as a result of the sale of its nuclear generating unit. Allowance for equity funds used
during construction increased $9 million in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily reflecting the East River Repowering Project. Other income increased $42 million in 2002 compared with 2001
due primarily to $27 million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim, a $10 million write-off in 2001 of an investment in the New York Discovery Fund, a
$9 million increase in interest earned on regulatory assets (See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies—Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities—SFAS
No. 71," above), offset in part by reduced income of $3 million from non-utility operations. Income tax expense decreased $4 million in 2002 compared
with 2001 due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits relating to the September 2001 sale of the Company's nuclear generating unit.

Net
Interest Charges

Net interest charges increased $7 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects principally the interest expense associated with a net
federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19 million), partially offset by decreased interest expense on long-term debt of $15 million.

Income
Tax

Federal income tax decreased $29 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting lower income before tax and deductions related to removal costs and tax
credits. In 2000, New York State implemented a tax law change that reduced or repealed certain revenue-based taxes and replaced them with a net income-based tax. State income taxes decreased
$57 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting lower income before tax, lowering of the tax rate and prior period adjustments. The state income tax expense is offset against the savings
from the eliminated or reduced revenue taxes. Any over- or under-collection of these taxes is deferred for return to, or recovery from, customers. See Notes A and M to the financial
statements.

O&R

Electric

Electric operating revenues decreased $62 million in 2002 compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower purchased power costs and
tax recoveries in 2002.

power costs decreased $70 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting decreases in the unit cost of purchased power and increased volumes of electricity purchased by customers from
other suppliers.

Electric
operating income increased $8 million in 2002 as compared with 2001. This increase reflects the impact of higher net electric revenues along with lower New York state and local income
and revenue taxes, offset in part by higher operation and maintenance charges and depreciation costs.

O&R's sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 1.6 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. Revenues from gas sales in New York are
subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period, total firm
sales and transportation volumes were 0.3 percent lower for 2002 compared with 2001.

Net
gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) were $1 million higher in 2002 due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off-system gas sales.

The
cost of gas purchased for resale was $40 million less in 2002 than in 2001, reflecting lower sales volumes and unit costs.

Decreased
gas revenues also reflect the reduced requirement for the company to buy gas for resale because of an increase in the purchase of gas by customers from other suppliers.

Gas
operating income increased by $1 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due primarily to higher net revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, offset in part by lower late payment
charge revenues and higher depreciation.

Other
Operations and Maintenance

Other operations and maintenance expense increased $2 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase was attributable primarily to higher electric
transmission and distribution expenditures, partially offset by lower customer bad debt and collections expense.

Taxes
Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes decreased by $2 million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of lower New York State revenue
taxes of $3 million, which resulted from reduced tax rates and lower energy costs billed to customers. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher property taxes of $1 million.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF

NEW YORK AND O&R) — CONTINUED

Net
Interest Charges

Interest charges increased by $4 million in 2002 compared with 2001, primarily as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on
O&R's deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey ($5 million) and lower allowance for borrowed funds used during construction ($1 million). These expenses were offset in part by
lower net financing costs of $1 million that resulted from lower average debt balances and interest rates in 2002.

Income
Taxes

Income taxes decreased by $1 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower state income taxes. State income taxes decreased primarily as
a result of a 0.5 percent reduction in the New York State tax rate. Excluding certain taxes in New York that are reconciled to amounts included in rates, income taxes increased by
$2 million due primarily to higher operating income in 2002.

UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER

Earnings for the unregulated subsidiaries decreased $14 million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting a non-cash, after-tax
charge in 2002 of $22 million for changes in accounting principles (see Notes L, P and T to the financial statements) and continued start-up losses in the company's wholesale
telecommunications business, including a non-cash, after-tax charge in 2002 of $5 million for a write-down of an investment in Neon

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

General

These combined notes accompany and form an integral part of the consolidated financial statements of each of Consolidated Edison, Inc., a holding
company, and its subsidiaries (Con Edison), Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Con Edison of New York) and Orange & Rockland Utilities, Inc. and
its subsidiaries (O&R). Con Edison of New York and O&R, which are regulated utilities, are subsidiaries of Con Edison. Con Edison also has the following unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison
Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity and gas to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R, and also
offers energy-related services; Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development), a
company that owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects; and Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications), a company that builds and operates fiber
optic networks to provide telecommunications services. Con Edison of New York and O&R are referred to in these notes as the "Utilities." Con Edison and the Utilities are collectively referred to in
these combined notes as the "Companies." Neither Con Edison of New York nor O&R makes any representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself.

Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

Con Edison's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Con Edison and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Utilities. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Accounting Policies

The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For the
Utilities, these accounting principles include the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state public utility regulatory
commissions having jurisdiction.

SFAS
No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be
accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will
be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in
the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No. 71.

The
Utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash
outflow has been made,


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

and
are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities' regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from
customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.

Other
significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced in Note E (Pension Benefits), Note F (Other Postretirement Benefits), Note K (Leases), Note L
(Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and Note P (Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities) to the financial statements.

Plant and Depreciation

Utility
Plant

Utility plant is stated at original cost. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll
taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC). The original cost of property is charged to accumulated depreciation as property is retired. The cost of
repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. At December 31, 2003, the Utilities reclassified the cost of removal less salvage value originally
included in the accumulated depreciation reserve to a regulatory liability in accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The amounts reclassified for Con
Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R were $777 million, $721 million and $56 million in 2003 and $813 million, $773 million and $40 million in 2002,
respectively.

Rates
used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate on the regulated utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of the FERC and the state
public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The rate is compounded semiannually,
and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities' own funds are credited to other income
(deductions). The AFDC rates for the Utilities were as follows:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

The estimated lives for utility plant for Con Edison of New York range from 25 to 80 years for electric, 15 to 85 years for gas, 30 to
75 years for steam and 8 to 50 years for general plant. For O&R, the estimated lives for utility plant range from 5 to 65 years for electric, 7 to 75 years for gas and 5 to
55 years for general plant.

Non-Utility
Plant

Non-utility plant is stated at original cost. For the Utilities, non-utility plant consists primarily of land and telecommunication
facilities that are currently not utilized within electric, gas or steam utility operations. For Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries, non-utility plant consists primarily of generating
assets and telecommunication facilities. Depreciation on these assets is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives, which
range from 5 to 40 years for generating assets, 3 to 20 years for telecommunication facilities and 3 to 50 years for other property.

The
average non-utility depreciation rates for Con Edison Development and Con Edison Communications were as follows:

In 2002, in accordance with SFAS No. 34, "Capitalization of Interest Costs," Con Edison capitalized interest on its borrowings associated with the
unregulated subsidiaries' capital projects in progress. Capitalized interest is added to the asset cost, and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The amount of such capitalized interest
cost for 2003 and 2002 was $6 million and $14 million, respectively. No amounts were capitalized in 2001.

Revenues

The Utilities and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for electric, gas or steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. The Utilities defer over a
12-month period all net interruptible gas revenues not authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) to be retained by the Utilities for refund to firm gas sales and
transportation customers. O&R and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy usage not yet billed to customers, while Con Edison of New York does not accrue
such revenues, in accordance with current regulatory agreements. Unbilled revenues included in Con Edison's and O&R's balance sheets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Recoverable Energy Costs

The Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate
provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. If the actual energy costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the
difference is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed energy costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle
(normally within one or two months). For Con Edison of New York, rate provisions also include a possible incentive or penalty of up to $25 million annually relating to electric costs (see
"Energy Price Hedging" in Note P). For O&R gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to
customers during a subsequent 12-month period.

The
difference between purchased power costs initially billed to the Utilities by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the cost of power subsequently determined by the NYISO to have
actually been supplied is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities'
customers. At December 31, 2003, Con Edison of New York had deferred $134 million of refunds received from the NYISO as a regulatory liability. In New Jersey, O&R's subsidiary purchases
energy under competitive bidding supervised by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) for contracts ranging from one to three years. Base rates are adjusted to
conform to contracted amounts when new contracts take effect and differences between actual costs and revenues collected, chiefly attributable to differences between estimated and actual customer
consumption, are reconciled at a later date. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements - Electric" in Note B for 2003 NJBPU ruling regarding previously deferred purchased power costs. In
Pennsylvania, O&R's subsidiary recovers fuel costs based on a rate allowed by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC).

Temporary Cash Investments

Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less. They are stated at
cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.

Investments

Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries, which, depending on the subsidiaries' percentage ownership, are
recorded at cost, accounted for under the equity method or accounted for as leveraged leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." See Note K for a discussion of
investments in Lease In/Lease Out transactions and Note H for a discussion of Con Edison Development's impairment charge related to its Genor generating asset. Con Edison of New York's
investments are recorded under the equity method.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Federal Income Tax

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for
temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a
portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or "turn-around" of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with
SFAS No. 71, the Utilities have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related
future tax expense (see Note M). In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No. 109 and providing assurances that these future
increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates.

Accumulated
deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.

Con
Edison and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate
return method. Each member pays tax or receives a benefit based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.

State Income Tax

The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies were changed effective January 1, 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced
and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June 2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to the tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the
difference between taxes being collected and the actual tax expense under the new tax law until that expense is incorporated in base rates.

Con
Edison and its subsidiaries file a combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the
combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does
business. Each member of the group pays or receives a benefit based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.

Taxes Other than Income Taxes

The PSC requires New York regulated utility companies to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e.,
included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is part of the PSC approved revenue requirement within each of the respective rate agreements.

Earnings Per Common Share

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share," Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of its consolidated income
statement. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders ("Net income for common stock" on Con Edison's consolidated income statement) by the weighted
average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be
outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.

Potentially
dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock and stock options whose exercise price is less than the average market price of the common shares during the reporting
period. See Note N.

Stock-Based Compensation

Con Edison accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value model of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related interpretations. All options and units granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common
stock on the date of grant. No compensation expense has been reflected in the income statement for any period presented except as shown below and as described in Note N. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if Con Edison had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as
amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123," for the purposes of
recognizing compensation expense on employee stock-based arrangements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Note B - Regulatory Matters

Rate and Restructuring Agreements

Electric

In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997
Restructuring Agreement). The 1997 Restructuring Agreement provided for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the period ended
March 31, 2002, a reasonable opportunity for recovery of "strandable costs" and the divestiture of electric generation capacity by the company.

At
December 31, 2003, approximately 92,000 Con Edison of New York customers representing approximately 28 percent of aggregate customer peak load were purchasing electricity from other
suppliers under the electric retail access program (which is available to all of the company's electric customers). The company delivers electricity to customers in this program through its regulated
transmission and distribution systems. In general, its delivery rates for retail access customers are equal to the full-service rates applicable to other comparable customers, less an
amount reflecting costs otherwise associated with supplying customers with energy and capacity.

Pursuant
to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates, on an annual basis, by $129 million in 1998, $80 million in April 1999,
$103 million in April 2000 and $209 million in April 2001. The effect of the April 2001 decrease for the rate year ended March 31, 2002 was partially offset
by recognition in income of $36 million relating to rates for distributing electricity to customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and $50 million (after tax) of deferred
generation divestiture gain. Rates were also reduced, on an annual basis, effective September 2001 by $313 million to reflect the divestiture of the company's nuclear generating facility
and the Roseton generating plant, which resulted in a reduction in operating and other expenses. See Note J.

Pursuant
to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, as amended by a July 1998 PSC order, Con Edison of New York sold approximately 7,780 MW of the approximately 8,300 MW of generating capacity that
it owned at the time the 1997 Restructuring Agreement was executed. See Note J.

In
November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that revised and extended the rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. Pursuant to the 2000
Electric Rate Agreement, the company reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000.

In
general under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York's base electric transmission and distribution rates will not otherwise be changed during the five-year period
ending March 2005 except (i) with respect to certain changes in costs above anticipated annual levels resulting from legal or regulatory requirements, inflation in excess of a
4 percent annual rate, property tax changes and environmental cost increases or (ii) if the PSC determines that circumstances have occurred that either


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

threaten
the company's economic viability or ability to provide, safe and adequate service, or render the company's rate of return unreasonable for the provision of safe and adequate service.

Under
the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, as approved by the PSC and as modified in December 2001, 35 percent of any earnings in each of the rate years ending March 2002 through
2005 above a specified rate of return on electric common equity will be retained for shareholders and the balance will be applied for customer benefit as determined by the PSC. In 2002 and 2003, Con
Edison of New York established an electric shared earnings reserve of $49 million for the rate year ending March 2003. An electric shared earnings reserve has not been established for
the rate year ending March 2004 based on results through the end of calendar year 2003, and there was no sharing of earnings for the rate year ended March 2002. The earnings threshold
for rate years ending March 2003 through March 2005 of 11.75 percent can be increased up to 50 basis points. The threshold will increase by 25 basis points if certain demand
reductions and supply increases exceed targeted projections and by an additional 25 basis points if certain customer service and reliability objectives are achieved. The company could be required to
pay up to $40 million annually in penalties if certain threshold service and reliability objectives are not achieved. The company recorded penalties relating to reliability objectives of
$8 million and $3 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Con
Edison of New York's potential electric strandable costs are utility investments and commitments that may not be recoverable in a competitive electric supply market. The company is recovering
these costs in the rates it charges all of its electric customers. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the stranded cost recovery provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, stating that
Con Edison of New York "will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March 31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments, under the
parameters and during the time periods set forth therein."

The
2000 Electric Rate Agreement also continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable
Energy Costs" below.

In
1997, the PSC approved a four-year O&R restructuring plan effective through December 31, 2002, pursuant to which O&R sold all of its generating assets, made retail access
available to all of its electric customers effective May 1999 and reduced its electric rates by $32 million through rate reductions implemented in December 1997 and 1998. In 1998
and 1999, similar plans for O&R's utility subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were approved by state regulators. The Pennsylvania plan provided for retail access for all customers effective
May 1999. The New Jersey plan provided for retail access for all customers effective August 1999 and rate reductions of $7 million effective August 1999, an additional
reduction of $3 million effective January 2001 and a final reduction of $6 million effective August 2002.

In
accordance with the April 1999 PSC order approving Con Edison's acquisition of O&R, Con Edison of New York reduced its annual electric and gas rates by $12 million and
$2 million, respectively, and O&R reduced its annual electric rates and gas rates by $6 million and $1 million, respectively.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

In
October 2003, the PSC approved agreements among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The
electric agreement, which covers the period from July 1, 2003 through October 31, 2006, provides for no changes to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and
offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11 million (pre-tax) over the period covered by the
agreement. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of a 12.75 percent
return on common equity during the three year period from July 2003 through June 2006. The period from July 2006 through October 2006 will not be subject to earnings
sharing.

In
July 2003, the NJBPU ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), the New Jersey utility subsidiary of O&R, for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred
purchased power costs. The NJBPU ordered a $7 million decrease in RECO's electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECO's recovery of approximately $83 million of
previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19 million of such costs and associated interest. At December 31, 2002, the
company had accrued a reserve for $13 million of the disallowance, and at June 30, 2003 reserved an additional $6 million for the disallowance.

Gas

In November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the
1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September 2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September 1996 levels through September 2000.

Under
the 2000 agreement, the rate of return on gas common equity above which Con Edison of New York shared with customers 50 percent of earnings was increased from 13 percent to
14 percent. In addition, customer bills were reduced by $20 million during the January through March 2001 period.

At
December 31, 2001, Con Edison of New York reserved $12 million for customers' share of gas earnings in excess of the 14 percent threshold for the rate year ended
September 2001. No additional amounts were reserved for the rate year ended September 2002.

In
April 2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September 30, 2004. The rate agreement reduced gas rates, on an
annualized basis, by $25 million.

During
the term of the 2002 agreement, Con Edison of New York retains 100 percent of the rate year return on equity up to 11.5 percent. If the return on equity is between
11.5 percent and 12.0 percent, 100 percent of the incremental return over 11.5 percent will be set aside for customer benefit. If the return on equity is above
12.0 percent, 50 percent of the incremental return over 12.0 percent will be retained by shareholders, and the remaining 50 percent will be shared with
customers. Earnings on gas common equity did not exceed the specified rate of return for the rate year ended September 30, 2003.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

The
2002 agreement also continued the retail access credit for firm transportation customers and other programs designed to increase customer and marketer participation in the gas retail access
program, the net costs of which are to be recovered from customers.

In
May 2002, Con Edison of New York established a $36 million reserve, funded by previously deferred customer credits, to recover unreimbursed costs directly related to the World Trade
Center attack.

In
November 2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for gas service by $108 million (9.8 percent increase), effective October 2004.
The filing with the PSC reflects a return on equity of 12 percent and an equity ratio of 49.3 percent and assumes firm gas sales and transportation delivery volume increases of
0.8 percent annually. The filing includes a proposal for a multi-year rate plan to continue the proposed level of charges through September 2007 provided charges would be
adjusted, effective October 2005 and October 2006, to reflect inflation and changes in pension and health insurance expenses, property taxes, capital expenditures, environmental
expenditures and certain other costs. In addition, the filing would continue the provisions pursuant to which energy costs are recovered from customers on a current basis and the effects of
weather-related changes on net income are moderated.

In
November 2000, the PSC authorized implementation of a gas rate agreement between O&R, the PSC staff, and certain other parties covering the period November 2000 through
April 2002. In October 2001, the PSC approved an extension of this agreement covering the period May 2002 through October 2003. With limited exceptions, the agreement
provided for no changes to base rates. O&R was permitted to retain, and amortized to income over the period November 2000 through October 2003, $18 million of deferred credits
that otherwise would have been credited to customers.

In
October 2003, the PSC approved agreements among O&R, the PSC staff and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for gas service. The O&R gas
agreement, which covers the period from November 1, 2003 through October 31, 2006, provides for increases in gas base rates of $9 million (5.8 percent) effective
November 2003, $9 million (4.8 percent) effective November 2004 and $5 million (2.5 percent) effective November 2005. The O&R gas agreement also
continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs
from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11 percent return on common equity. The agreement also contains incentives under which,
among other things, the company earns additional amounts based on attaining specified targets for customer subscription to its retail access programs and the achievement of certain net revenue targets
for interruptible sales and transportation customers.

Steam

In November 2000, the PSC authorized implementation of an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties, that
provided for a $17 million steam rate increase in October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004. The


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

company
is required to share with customers 50 percent of any earnings for any rate year covered by the agreement above a specified rate of return on steam common equity (11.0 percent
for the first rate year, the 12-month period ended September 2001; 10.5 percent thereafter if the repowering of its steam-electric generating plant is not completed). The net
revenue effect associated with sales increases related to colder than normal winter weather (November through April) will be excluded from any earnings measurement. Earnings on steam common equity did
not exceed the specific rates of return for the rate years ended September 30, 2001, 2002 or 2003.

Under
the steam rate agreement, upon completion of the project to add incremental generating capacity at the East River steam-electric generating plant, the net benefits of the project (including the
net after-tax gain from the sale of a nine-acre development site in mid-town Manhattan along the East River) allocable to steam operations will inure to the benefit
of steam customers. It is now expected that this project will not be completed until after the expiration of the current steam rate agreement. Con Edison of New York believes the same provisions would
apply in the next rate agreement.

The
agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased steam and fuel costs and requires Con Edison of New York to develop a
strategy for hedging price variations for a portion of the steam produced each year.

In
November 2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for steam service by $129 million (14.6 percent increase), net of an estimated
$64 million of expected fuel savings associated with the ongoing East River Repowering Project, effective October 2004. The filing with the PSC reflects a return on equity of
12 percent and an equity ratio of 49.3 percent. The filing includes a proposal for a multi-year rate plan to continue the proposed level of charges through
September 2007 provided charges would be adjusted, effective October 2005 and October 2006, to reflect inflation and changes in pension and health insurance expenses, property
taxes, capital expenditures, environmental expenditures and certain other costs. In addition, the filing would continue the provisions pursuant to which fuel and purchased power costs are recovered
from customers on a current basis.

Note C - Capitalization

Common Stock

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Con Edison owned all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Utilities. Con Edison of New York owns
$962 million of Con Edison stock, which it purchased in 1998 and 1999 in connection with Con Edison's stock repurchase plan.

Capitalization of Con Edison

The outstanding capitalization for each of the Companies is shown on its Consolidated Statement of Capitalization, and for Con Edison includes the Utilities'
outstanding preferred stock and debt.

Preferred Stock of Utility Subsidiaries

As of December 31, 2003, 1,915,319 shares of Con Edison of New York's $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "$5 Preferred") and 375,626 shares of its
Cumulative Preferred Stock ($100 par value) were outstanding.

Dividends
on the $5 Preferred stock are $5 per share per annum, payable quarterly, and dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock are $4.65 per share per annum, payable quarterly. The preferred
dividends must be declared by Con Edison of New York's Board of Trustees to become payable. See "Dividends" below.

With
respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of shareholders of Con Edison of New York, Con Edison (which owns all of the 235,488,094 shares of Con Edison of New York's common shares
that are outstanding) and the holders of the $5 Preferred are each entitled to one vote for each share held. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock have no
right to vote; provided, however, that if the $5 Preferred is no longer outstanding, the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share with respect to any corporate
action to be taken by a vote of the shareholders of Con Edison of New York. In addition, if dividends are in arrears for certain periods, the holders are entitled to certain rights with respect to the
election of Con Edison of New York's Trustees. Without the consent of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, Con Edison of New York may not create or authorize any kind of stock ranking prior
to the Cumulative Preferred Stock or, if such actions would affect the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock adversely, be a party to any consolidation or merger, create or amend the terms of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock or reclassify the Cumulative Preferred Stock. Con Edison of New York may redeem the $5 Preferred at a redemption price of $105 per share and the Cumulative Preferred Stock
at a redemption price of $101 per share (in each case, plus accrued and unpaid dividends). In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of Con Edison of New York, before
any distribution of capital assets could be made to the holders of the company's common stock, the holders of the $5 Preferred and the Cumulative Preferred Stock would each be entitled to receive $100
per share, in the case of an involuntary liquidation, or an amount equal to the redemption price per share, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, in each case together with all accrued and unpaid
dividends.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Dividends

In accordance with PSC requirements, the dividends that the Utilities may pay are limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income
available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the calculation of "income available for dividends" are non-cash charges to income
resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison
proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing each utility subsidiary's equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.

In
addition, no dividends may be paid, or funds set apart for payment, on Con Edison of New York's common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5 Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock
have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment.

Long-term Debt

Long-term debt maturing in the period 2004-2008 is as follows:

(Millions of Dollars)

Con Edison

Con Edison of New York

O&R




-

-

Long-term
debt includes notes issued by O&R to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) for the net proceeds of NYSERDA's $55 million aggregate
principal amount of Series 1994A and $44 million aggregate principal amount of Series 1995A Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds. The interest rate determination method for
this debt is subject to change in accordance with the related indenture, and the debt currently bears interest at a weekly rate determined by its remarketing agent. The debt is subject to optional
and, in certain circumstances, mandatory tender for purchase by O&R. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in Note P.

Long-term
debt is stated at cost, which, as of December 31, 2003, approximates fair value (estimated based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities), except for
$225 million of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in Note P.

At
December 31, 2003, long-term debt includes $23 million of mortgage bonds collateralized by substantially all the utility plant and other physical property of O&R's New
Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries, $141 million of non-recourse debt of a Con Edison Development subsidiary collateralized by a pledge of a New Jersey power plant, a
related power purchase agreement and project assets, and $339 million of debt secured by a New Hampshire power plant and related assets. See Note T. At December 31, 2003,
restricted cash relating to the operations of the New Jersey power plant was $17 million.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Significant Debt Covenants

There are no significant debt covenants under the financing arrangements for the debentures of Con Edison, Con Edison of New York or O&R, other than obligations
to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions. The
tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Utilities are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below.

The
tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of the Utilities to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of
tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the
tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided,
constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. The arrangements for certain series of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing
(Series 1999A, 2001A and 2001B), aggregating $615 million, and O&R's tax-exempt financing (Series 1994A and Series 1995A), aggregating $99 million,
include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt
to which such provisions applied. Additional series of Con Edison of New York tax-exempt financing issued in 2004 (Series 2004A and 2004B), aggregating $245 million, also
include such covenants and provisions. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied might and, in certain circumstances
would, become due and payable immediately.

The
liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the obligated utility will not at any time
exceed 0.65 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the utility will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default,
defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels ($100 million for Con Edison of New York; $13 million for O&R).

Note D - Short Term Borrowing

At December 31, 2003, Con Edison and the Utilities had commercial paper programs under which short-term borrowings are made at prevailing
market rates, totaling $950 million. These programs are supported by revolving credit agreements with banks. At December 31, 2003, $42 million was outstanding under Con Edison's
$350 million program, $99 million was outstanding under Con Edison of New York's $500 million program, and $15 million was outstanding under O&R's $100 million
program, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.0 percent. The Utilities change the amount of their programs from time to time, subject to FERC-authorized limits of
$1 billion for Con Edison of New York and $150 million for O&R.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Bank commitments under the revolving credit agreements total $950 million, of which $563 million was renewed in November 2003. The commitments may
terminate upon a change of control of Con Edison, and borrowings under the agreements are subject to certain conditions, including that the ratio (calculated in accordance with the agreements) of debt
to total capital of the borrower not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1. At December 31, 2003, this ratio was 0.52 to 1 for Con Edison, 0.50 to 1 for Con Edison of New York and 0.46 to 1 for O&R.
Borrowings under the agreements are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels. The fees charged the Companies for the revolving credit facilities and borrowings under the agreements reflect
their respective credit ratings.

See
Note U for information about short-term borrowing between related parties, which the FERC has authorized.

Note E - Pension Benefits

Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Con Edison of New York
and O&R and certain employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Investment
gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period. This
amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," which provides a "corridor method" for
moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the
corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.

Consistent
with the provisions of SFAS No. 71 and its rate agreements, O&R defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and the current rate
allowance for its New York operations.

Con
Edison uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension plan.

The expected return assumption reflects anticipated returns on the plan's current and future assets. The Companies use historical investment data as well as the
plan's target asset class and investment management mix to determine the expected return on plan assets. This analysis incorporates such factors as real return, inflation, and expected investment
manager performance for each broad asset class applicable to the plan. Historical plan performance and peer data are also reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Expected Contributions

Based on current estimates, the Companies are not required under funding regulations and laws to make any contributions to the pension plan during 2004. O&R and
Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries expect to make discretionary contributions of $22 million and $2 million, respectively, in 2004.

Plan Assets

The asset allocation for the pension plans at the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the target allocation for 2004, by asset category, are as follows:

Con Edison has established a pension trust for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to participants

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Pursuant
to resolutions adopted by Con Edison's Board of Directors, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) has general oversight responsibility
for Con Edison's pension and other employee benefit plans. The plans' Named Fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including
overall responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers. The Named Fiduciaries consist of Con Edison's chief executive, chief
financial and chief accounting officers and others the Board of Directors may appoint in addition to or in place of the designated Named Fiduciaries.

The
long-term investment objective for the pension trust is to maximize the total real return on trust assets while limiting risk, reflected in volatility of returns, to prudent levels. To
that end, the investment strategy focuses on preserving and enhancing the value of assets in real terms over time through selection of investment managers within a framework that provides
diversification between and among asset classes, investment styles, and managers. The target asset allocation is reviewed periodically based on asset/liability studies and may be modified as
appropriate. The target asset allocation for 2004 reflects the results of such a study conducted in 2003.

Individual
managers operate under written guidelines provided by Con Edison, which cover such areas as investment objectives, performance measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions,
trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Manager performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines are monitored on an ongoing basis, and
reviewed by the Named Fiduciaries and reported to the Committee on a quarterly basis. A change in fund managers and/or rebalancing of the portfolio is undertaken as appropriate. The Named Fiduciaries

The
Companies also offer a defined contribution savings plan that covers substantially all employees and made contributions to the plan as follows:

Note F - Other Postretirement Benefits

The Utilities have contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription drug programs for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses.

Con
Edison of New York also has a contributory life insurance program for bargaining unit employees and provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired
management employees. O&R has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Certain
employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries are eligible to receive benefits under these programs. The company has reserved the right to amend or terminate these programs.

Investment
plan gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period for the Utilities. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a
10-year period.

For
O&R, plan assets are used to pay benefits and expenses for participants who retired on or after January 1, 1995. O&R pays benefits for other participants who retired prior to 1995. Plan
assets include amounts owed by the plan trust to O&R of $1 million in 2003 and 2002, and less than $1 million in 2001.

Consistent
with the provisions of SFAS No. 71, O&R defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," and the current rate allowance for its Pennsylvania and New York operations.

Con
Edison has established postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan trusts for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing other postretirement benefits to
participants and beneficiaries.

Refer
to Note E for a discussion of Con Edison's investment strategy.

Effect of Medicare Prescription Subsidy

In December 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. As permitted by the FASB, the
Companies have elected not to defer recognition of this Act. See Note V. To reflect the effect of the Act on the plans, the 2003 year-end accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations were reduced for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R by $128 million, $114 million and $14 million, respectively, and the 2004 after-tax
postretirement benefit costs are estimated to be reduced by $10 million for Con Edison, $9 million for Con Edison


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

of
New York and $1 million for O&R. The Companies will recognize the 28% subsidy (reflected as an unrecognized net gain to each plan) as an offset to plan costs. The 28% subsidy is expected to
reduce prescription drug plan costs by about 25%. The Companies' actuaries have determined that each prescription drug plan provides a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare
prescription drug plan and projections indicate that this will be the case for 20 years. (For a small number of pension recipients, whose benefits total less than $12,000 per year, this will be
the case indefinitely.) When the plans' benefits are no longer actuarially equivalent to the Medicare plan, 25% of the retirees in each plan are assumed to begin to decline participation in the
Companies' prescription programs. Specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and guidance, when issued, could require a change to previously reported
information.

Note G - Environmental Matters

Superfund Sites

Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities
and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored.

The
Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators
of hazardous substances for investigation and remediation costs (which includes costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring) and environmental damages.
Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the
Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas sites, are referred to herein as "Superfund Sites."

For
Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the
amount the Utilities will need to pay to discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites (including the manufactured gas sites) for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation
and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate
the sites in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites.

For
the 12 months ended December 31, 2003, Con Edison of New York and O&R incurred approximately $21 million and $5 million, respectively, for environmental remediation
costs. No insurance recoveries were received. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2002, Con Edison of New York and O&R incurred approximately $22 million and $2 million,
respectively, for environmental remediation costs, and O&R received insurance recoveries of $7 million.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites for each of the Companies at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 were as follows:

Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to Superfund Sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. As investigations progress on these
and other sites, the Companies expect that additional liability will be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. The Utilities are permitted under their current
rate agreements to recover or defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) certain site investigation and remediation costs.

Con
Edison of New York estimated in 2002 that for its manufactured gas sites, many of which have not been investigated, its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and
remediation of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants could range from approximately $65 million to $1.1 billion. O&R estimated in 2002 that for
its manufactured gas sites the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the remediation of such contaminants could range from approximately $25 million to $95 million. These
estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at each of the sites and additional assumptions regarding the extent of contamination and the type and extent of remediation that may
be required. Actual experience may be materially different.

Asbestos Proceedings

Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large
amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many,
have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions
of dollars but the Companies believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, as experienced through the disposition of previous claims. Con Edison of New York estimated in 2002 that its aggregate
undiscounted potential liability for these suits and additional such suits that may be brought over the next 50 years ranges from approximately $38 million to $162 million (with
no amount within the range considered more
reasonable than any other). The estimate was based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Actual experience may be materially different.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

In
addition, workers' compensation administrative proceedings have been commenced, wherein current and former employees claim benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos.

Con
Edison of New York is permitted under its current rate agreements to defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) liabilities incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers'
compensation claims. O&R defers as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates), liabilities incurred for asbestos claims by employees relating to its divested generating plants.

The
accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers' compensation proceedings (including those related to asbestos exposure) and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets for each of the Companies at
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 were as follows:

Note H - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Con Edison)

In 2003, continuing adverse market conditions affecting Con Edison's unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses led to the testing of their assets
for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock." For Con Edison Communications, it was determined that the book value of its assets were likely not fully recoverable. Therefore, in accordance
with SFAS No. 144, Con Edison Communications reduced its assets to their fair value by recording a pre-tax impairment charge of $140 million. At the same time,
$1 million (pre-tax) of capitalized interest at Con Edison, which was related to the investment in Con Edison Communications, was deemed impaired. For Con Edison Development, the
analysis resulted in a total pre-tax impairment charge of $18 million related to two combustion turbines and its equity investment in a 42 MW electric generating plant in Guatemala.
Estimated fair values were determined based upon market prices of comparable assets.

Note I - Non-Utility Generators

The Utilities have long-term contracts with non-utility generators (NUGs) for electric generating capacity. Assuming performance by the
NUGs, the Utilities are obligated over the terms of the contracts (which extend for various periods, up to 2036) to make capacity and other fixed payments.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

For
the years 2004 through 2008, the capacity and other fixed payments under the contracts are estimated to be the following:

Such payments gradually increase to approximately $650 million in 2013, and thereafter decline significantly. For energy delivered under most of these
contracts, the Utilities are obligated to pay variable prices that are estimated to be lower overall than expected market levels. In addition, for energy delivered under one of the contracts (for 20
MW), O&R is obligated to pay variable prices that are currently estimated to be above market levels.

At
December 31, 2003, the aggregate capacity produced under the NUG contracts was approximately 3,200 MW, including capacity (commitment ends 2005) from the approximately 1,000 MW nuclear
generating unit that Con Edison of New York sold in 2001. For energy from the unit, the company has a commitment (which ends in 2004) under which it is obligated to pay an average annual price of 3.9
cents per kWh. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned governmental authorities to close this plant. If this were to occur, the owner would not be obligated to provide the company with
replacement power. Additionally, the contracts include 500 MW of energy and capacity that the company agreed to purchase annually for 10 years from a plant in Queens County, New York that is
scheduled to begin operation in 2006.

Under
the terms of its electric rate agreements, Con Edison of New York is recovering in rates the charges it incurs under mandated contracts with NUGs. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides that,
after March 31, 2005, Con Edison of New York will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover, through a non-bypassable charge to customers, the amount, if any, by which the actual
costs of its purchases under the contracts exceed market value. The PSC specifically approved rate recovery of the nuclear capacity and energy purchases. O&R recovers costs under its NUG contracts
pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction.

Note J - Generation Divestiture

Pursuant to restructuring agreements approved by the PSC (See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Note B), the Utilities have divested all of their
electric generating assets other than approximately 630 MW of Con Edison of New York's steam/electric generating stations located in New York City. Con Edison of New York sold approximately 6,300 MW
of electric generating assets in 1999 and approximately 1,480 MW in 2001. O&R completed the sale of all of its generating assets prior to the completion of Con Edison's purchase of O&R in 1999.

Pursuant
to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the net after-tax gain (including interest accrued thereon) from Con Edison of New York's 1999 generation divestiture was applied in 2000 as
follows:


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

$188 million
was credited against electric distribution plant balances; $107 million was used to offset a like amount of regulatory assets (including deferred power contract termination
costs); $50 million (after-tax) was deferred for recognition in income during the 12 months ended March 31, 2002; and $12 million was deferred to be used for
low-income customer programs. In addition, $30 million of employee retirement incentive expenses related to the generation divestiture was deferred for amortization over
15 years and $15 million of such expenses was charged to income in 2000.

The
2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides for Con Edison of New York to amortize to income a $74 million regulatory asset representing incremental electric capacity costs incurred prior to
May 2000 to purchase capacity from the buyers of the generating assets the company sold in 1999. Amortization to income will take place in years in which the company would otherwise share
excess earnings with customers, in amounts corresponding to the company's share of the excess earnings. By March 2005, any remaining unrecovered balance will be charged to expense. Of this
amount, $30 million was charged to expense in 2002 and $15 million was expensed in 2001.

In
January 2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its 480 MW interest in the jointly-owned Roseton generating station for $138 million. The gain from the sale, which has been
deferred as a regulatory liability, was $55 million at December 31, 2003, and $64 million at December 31, 2002. In September 2001, the company completed the sale of
its approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating plant and related assets for $505 million. The proceeds were net of a $74 million payment to increase the value of the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds being transferred to $430 million (the amount provided for in the sales agreement). The net after-tax loss from the sale was deferred as a regulatory
asset. The company was authorized, effective September 2001, to continue to recover the cost of the nuclear assets, which is included in rates, and to amortize the regulatory asset, until the
loss on divestiture has been recovered. The unrecovered amount was $159 million at December 31, 2003 and $215 million at December 31, 2002. The 2000 Electric Agreement
provides that the company "will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March 31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments."

Note K - Leases

Con Edison's subsidiaries lease electric generating and gas distribution facilities, other electric transmission and distribution facilities, office buildings
and equipment. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, these leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair
rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business.

Capital
leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental
payments

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

As part of a broad initiative, the Internal Revenue Service is reviewing certain categories of transactions. Among these are transactions in which a taxpayer
leases property and then immediately subleases it back to the lessor (termed "Lease In/Lease Out," or LILO transactions). In 1997 and 1999, Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries invested
$93 million in two LILO transactions, involving gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands, which represented approximately 36 percent of the purchase price;
the remaining 64 percent or $166 million was furnished by third-party financing in the form of long-term debt that provides no recourse against the subsidiaries and is
primarily secured by the assets, except for guarantees of up to $10 million of the debt. Approximately half of these guarantees expired prior to December 31, 2002 and the other half will
expire at the end of May 2004. At December 31, 2003, the company's investment of $202 million in these leveraged leases net of deferred tax liabilities of $142 million
amounted to $60 million, which was included at cost on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet. On audit, the Internal Revenue Service has proposed that the tax losses recognized in connection
with the 1997 LILO transaction be disallowed for the tax year 1997. Con Edison believes its position is correct and is currently appealing the auditors' proposal within the Internal Revenue Service.
The estimated total tax savings from the two LILO transactions during the tax years 1997 through 2003, in the aggregate, was $100 million.

Note L - Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Con Edison)

On January 1, 2002, Con Edison adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill (i.e., the
excess of cost over fair value of the net assets of a business acquired) and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least
annually. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their finite useful lives.

In
2002, the company recognized a loss of $34 million ($20 million after-tax) as an offset to goodwill recorded by Con Edison Development relating to certain of its
generation assets.

During
2003, Con Edison completed the impairment test for its goodwill of $406 million and determined that it was not impaired.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Had
Con Edison been accounting for goodwill under SFAS No. 142 for all periods presented, its income and earnings per share would have been as follows:

Note N - Stock-Based Compensation

Under Con Edison's Stock Option Plan (the Plan), options may be granted to officers and key employees of Con Edison and its subsidiaries for up to a total of
10 million shares of Con Edison's common stock. Generally options vest three years after the grant date and expire 10 years from the grant date.

As
permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Companies elected to follow APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for their employee stock options. Under the intrinsic value method of
APB No. 25, no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of Con Edison's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

Under
the Plan, exercise of Con Edison's employee stock options requires payment in full of the exercise price, unless the committee of Con Edison's Board of Directors that administers the Plan
determines that options may be settled by paying to the option holder the difference between the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option and the exercise price (cash settlement).
In 2002, to ensure that the exercise of currently exercisable options would comply with certain technical requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applicable to certain officers of the
Companies, the committee determined that 1996 and 1997 stock options covering 295,500 shares of common stock held by those officers may be settled by the cash settlement method. Charges to expense are
recognized with respect to these options to the extent the fair market value of the common shares changes.

The
following table summarizes the expense recognized in relation to the stock options subject to cash settlement:

Disclosure
of pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No. 123. See "Stock-Based Compensation" in Note A for an illustration of the effect on
net income and earnings per share if the Companies had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to their stock-based employee compensation. The fair values of options
granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 are $4.30, $6.37 and $5.23 per share, respectively. These values were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following

Pursuant
to employment agreements, effective September 2000, certain senior officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries were granted an aggregate of 350,000 restricted stock units, subject to
the officers meeting the terms and conditions of the agreements. In June 2002, an additional 150,000 restricted stock units were granted to certain senior officers of Con Edison and its
subsidiaries under similar terms. The units, each of which represents the right to receive one share of Con Edison common stock and related dividends, vest ratably through August 2005 or
immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. Pursuant to APB No. 25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for the units over the vesting period.

Note O - Financial Information By Business Segment

The business segments of each of the Companies were determined based on similarities in economic characteristics, the regulatory environment, and management's
reporting requirements.

Con
Edison's principal business segments are Con Edison of New York's regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&R's regulated electric and gas utility activities and other operations,
Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries and other (parent holding company interest and other expenses and consolidation adjustments). Con Edison of New York's principal business segments are its
regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. O&R's principal business segments are its regulated electric and gas utility activities and other operations.

All
revenues of these business segments, excluding revenues earned by Con Edison Development on certain energy infrastructure projects, which are deemed to be immaterial, are from customers located in
the United States of America. Also, all assets of the business segments, excluding certain investments in energy infrastructure projects by Con Edison Development ($216 million at
December 31, 2003), are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note A to the financial statements of this
report.

Common
services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.

Note P - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Effective January 2001, the Companies adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended (SFAS
No. 133). Under SFAS No. 133, derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, unless an exception is available under the standard.
Certain qualifying derivative contracts have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts. These contracts are not reported at fair value under SFAS No. 133.

Energy Price Hedging

Con Edison's subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas by using derivative
instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. The fair values of these hedges at December 31, 2003 and
2002 were as follows:

Con Edison

Con Edison

O&R

(Millions of Dollars)







Fair value of net assets

$


$


$


$


$


$


Cash Flow Hedges

Con Edison's subsidiaries designate a portion of derivative instruments held for purposes other than trading as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133.
Under cash flow hedge accounting, to the extent a hedge is determined to be "effective," the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to
earnings at the time the underlying transaction is completed. A gain or loss relating to any portion of the hedge determined to be "ineffective" is recognized in earnings in the period in which such
determination is made.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

For
the Companies, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges for energy transactions, net of tax, included in accumulated OCI for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as
follows:

The
actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in market prices. The effect of reclassification from accumulated OCI
to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transaction in earnings.

For
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Companies recognized in net earnings unrealized pre-tax net gains and losses relating to hedge ineffectiveness of these cash flow
hedges as follows:

Other Derivatives

Con Edison of New York enters into certain non-trading derivative instruments, some of which are on behalf of O&R, that are not designated as hedges
for accounting purposes. However, management believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Utilities, with limited exceptions,
recover all gains and losses on these instruments. See


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

"Recoverable
Energy Costs" in Note A. Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Energy also enter into certain other contracts that are derivatives, but do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS
No. 133. Changes in the fair market value of these derivative contracts are recorded in earnings in the reporting period in which they occur. In the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, the Companies recognized in earnings unrealized pre-tax net gains and losses relating to these hedges as follows:

Energy Trading Activities

Con Edison Energy engages in energy-trading activities. Con Edison Energy makes wholesale purchases and sales of electric, gas and related energy trading
products and provides risk management services to other unregulated Con Edison subsidiaries in order to optimize the value of their electric generating facilities and retail supply contracts. It also
engages in a limited number of other
wholesale commodity transactions. Con Edison Energy utilizes forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and capacity, over-the-counter swap contracts,
exchange-traded natural gas and crude oil futures and options, transmission congestion contracts and other physical and financial contracts. As of December 31, 2003, these contracts had terms
of three years or less and their fair value was $4 million as of December 31, 2003 and $5 million as of December 31, 2002. Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries recognized
in earnings pre-tax net losses relating to energy trading contracts of $3 million and $1 million, including the amortization of premiums paid and received, and excluding the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Effective
October 1, 2002, all derivative energy-trading contracts are reported at fair value, with corresponding changes in value recognized immediately in earnings in accordance with SFAS
No. 133 and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in
Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." Prior to October 2002, energy-trading contracts were accounted for under EITF Issue No. 98-10, "Accounting for Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," which was rescinded in October of 2002. As a result, previously recognized mark-to-market gains and losses on
non-derivative contracts were reversed. Con Edison reported a $2 million after-tax loss for the effect of the rescission as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Interest Rate Hedging

Con Edison's subsidiaries use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure associated with debt. The fair values of these interest rate swaps at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:

Con
Edison of New York's swap (related to $225 million of tax-exempt debt) is designated as a fair value hedge, which qualifies for "short-cut" hedge accounting under
SFAS No. 133. Under this method, changes in fair value of the swap are recorded directly against the carrying value of the hedged bonds and have no impact on earnings.

Con
Edison Development and O&R's swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. Any gain or loss on the hedges is recorded in OCI and reclassified to interest expense and included
in earnings during the periods in which the hedged interest payments occur. The contractual components of the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges are as follows:

The
actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in interest rates. The effect of reclassification from accumulated
OCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transaction in earnings. The reclassification to earnings has no impact on O&R's results of operations because these costs are
currently recovered in O&R's rates.

Note Q - Northeast Utilities Litigation (Con Edison)

In March 2001, Con Edison commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entitled Consolidated
Edison, Inc. v. Northeast Utilities (the First Federal Proceeding), seeking a declaratory judgment that Northeast Utilities has failed to meet certain conditions precedent to Con Edison's
obligation to complete its acquisition of Northeast Utilities pursuant to their agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October 13, 1999, as amended and restated as of January 11, 2000
(the merger agreement). In May 2001, Con Edison amended its complaint. As amended, Con Edison's complaint seeks, among other things, recovery of damages sustained by it as a result of the
material breach of the merger agreement by Northeast Utilities, the court's declaration that under the merger agreement Con Edison has no further or continuing obligations to Northeast Utilities and
that Northeast Utilities has no further or continuing rights against Con Edison.

In
June 2001, Northeast Utilities withdrew the separate action it commenced in March 2001 in the same court and filed as a counter-claim to the First Federal Proceeding its claim that
Con Edison materially breached the merger agreement and that, as a result, Northeast Utilities and its shareholders have suffered substantial damages, including the difference between the
consideration to be paid to Northeast Utilities shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement and the market value of Northeast Utilities common stock, expenditures in connection with regulatory
approvals and lost business opportunities. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Con Edison agreed to acquire Northeast Utilities for $26.00 per share (an estimated aggregate of not more than
$3.9 billion) plus $0.0034 per share for each day after August 5, 2000 through the day prior to the completion of the transaction, payable 50 percent in cash and 50 percent
in stock.

In
March 2003, the court ruled on certain motions filed by Con Edison and Northeast Utilities in the First Federal Proceeding. The court ruled that Con Edison's claim against Northeast
Utilities for hundreds of millions of dollars for breach of the merger agreement, as well as Con Edison's claim that Northeast Utilities underwent a material adverse change, will go to trial. The
court also dismissed Con


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Edison's
fraud and misrepresentation claims. In addition, the court ruled that Northeast Utilities' claims on behalf of its shareholders against Con Edison for damages in excess of $1.2 billion
will go to trial. The court has not yet ruled on subsequent motions by both parties regarding evidence to be presented at trial.

In
May 2003, a lawsuit by a purported class of Northeast Utilities' shareholders, entitled Rimkoski, et al. v. Consolidated Edison, Inc., was filed in New York County Supreme Court (the
State Proceeding) alleging breach of the merger agreement. The complaint defines the putative class as holders of Northeast Utilities' common stock on March 5, 2001, and alleges that the class
members were intended third party beneficiaries of the merger agreement. The complaint seeks damages believed to be substantially duplicative of those sought by Northeast Utilities on behalf of its
shareholders in the First Federal Proceeding. In December 2003, the court granted the State Proceeding plaintiffs' motion to intervene in the First Federal Proceeding and in
February 2004, the State Proceeding was dismissed without prejudice. In January 2004, Rimkoski filed a motion to certify his action as a class action on behalf of all holders of
Northeast Utilities' common stock on March 5, 2000 and to appoint Rimkoski as class representative. Northeast Utilities has opposed the motion.

In
October 2003, a lawsuit by a purported class of Northeast Utilities' shareholders, entitled Siegel et al. v. Consolidated Edison, Inc., was commenced in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (the Second Federal Proceeding). The putative class in the Second Federal Proceeding is the same putative class as in the State Proceeding. The amended
complaint in the Second Federal Proceeding seeks unspecified injunctive relief and damages believed to be substantially duplicative of the damages sought from Con Edison in the First Federal
Proceeding and in the State Proceeding. In January 2004, both Con Edison and Northeast Utilities (which has sought to intervene in the Second Federal Proceeding) moved to dismiss the Second
Federal Proceeding and the plaintiffs in the Second Federal Proceeding moved to consolidate that proceeding with the First Federal Proceeding.

Con
Edison believes that Northeast Utilities materially breached the merger agreement, and that Con Edison did not materially breach the merger agreement. Con Edison believes it was not obligated to
acquire Northeast Utilities because Northeast Utilities did not meet the merger agreement's conditions that Northeast Utilities perform all of its obligations under the merger agreement. Those
obligations include the obligation that it carry on its businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; that the representations and warranties made by it in the merger agreement were
true and correct when made and remain true and correct; and that there be no material adverse change with respect to Northeast Utilities.

Con
Edison is unable to predict whether or not any Northeast Utilities related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on Con Edison's financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

Note R - Lower Manhattan Restoration (Con Edison and Con Edison of New York)

Con Edison of New York estimates that it will incur $430 million of costs for emergency response to the September 11, 2001 attack on the World
Trade Center, and for resulting temporary and subsequent


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

permanent
restoration of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution facilities damaged in the attack. Most of the costs are expected to be capital in nature. In December 2001, the
company filed a petition with the PSC for authorization to defer the costs. The company estimates that $90 million of the costs will be covered by insurance. It expects the PSC to permit
recovery from customers of the costs, net of any federal reimbursement, insurance payments and tax savings. In August 2002, Congress appropriated funds for which the company is eligible to
apply to recover costs it incurred in connection with the attack. In accordance with the procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds, the company submitted its initial application for
funds in October 2003 and received the first installment of $29 million on October 31, 2003. The company will submit additional applications when appropriate. At
December 31, 2003, the company had capitalized $186 million of such costs as utility plant and deferred $68 million, including interest, as a regulatory asset.

In
addition, based upon New York City's announced plans for improvement projects in lower Manhattan, including a transportation hub, the company anticipates that over the next five to ten years it may
incur up to $250 million in incremental costs in lower Manhattan. The company expects that it would recover any such costs from customers through the utility ratemaking process.

Note S - Guarantees (Con Edison)

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of certain types of guarantees, a guarantor recognize and account for the fair value of the guarantee as a liability. FIN 45
contains exclusions to this requirement, including the exclusion of a parent's guarantee of its subsidiaries' debt to a third party. FIN 45 is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002.

Con
Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition, a Con Edison Development
subsidiary has issued guarantees on behalf of entities in which it has an equity interest. Con Edison's guarantees had maximum limits totaling $1 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
as to which underlying guaranteed obligations of $320 million and $588 million, respectively, were outstanding.

The

Commodity Transactions—

Con Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its subsidiaries in order to facilitate physical and financial
transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodity services. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary guaranteed payment for fuel oil purchases by a
foreign generating project in which it has an equity interest. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated
balance sheet.

Affordable Housing Program—

Con Edison Development guarantees the repurchase and remarketing obligations of one of its subsidiaries with
respect to the debt relating to moderate-income rental apartment properties eligible for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with EITF Issue
No. 94-01, "Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting from Investments in Affordable Housing Projects," neither the rental apartment properties nor the related indebtedness is included
on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet.

Intra-company Guarantees

•

$50 million
relates to a guarantee issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Communications to Con Edison of New York for payment relating to the use of space in
the latter's facilities and the construction of new telecommunications underground facilities.

•

$6 million
relates to commodity guarantees issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions to Rockland Electric and Con Edison of New
York, respectively.

Other Guarantees—

Con Edison, Con Edison Development and its subsidiaries also guarantee the following:

•

$21 million
for guarantees, standby financial letters of credit and comfort letters in connection with investments in energy infrastructure power and cogeneration
projects;

•

$7 million
for franchise agreements with the City of New York and other localities;

•

$12 million
for certain rent payment obligations of Con Edison's subsidiaries under various lease agreements for office buildings;

•

$25 million
for a parental guarantee provided by Con Edison on Con Edison Solution's indemnity agreement for surety bonds.

Note T - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (Con Edison)

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46), which addresses the
consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE's) by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it
to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is
the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the VIE.


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

FIN
46 is effective no later than the end of the first fiscal year or interim period that ends after March 15, 2004. However, as it relates to special-purpose entities, FIN 46 is effective no
later than the end of the fiscal year or interim period that ends after December 15, 2003. Earlier application is permitted. In accordance with FIN 46, in December 2003, Con Edison
consolidated the Newington Project and a Con Edison Solutions' project, which are described in the following paragraphs.

In
November 2000, a Con Edison Development subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement with Hawkeye L.P. (Lessor) to finance construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric
generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, and related EITF issues (including EITF Issue No. 90-15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors,
Residual Value Guarantees, and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" and EITF Issue No. 97-10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction"), the Newington Project
and the related obligations were not included on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet prior to December 2003.

At
the expiration of the initial lease term in June 2010, the Con Edison Development subsidiary has the option to extend the lease or purchase the project for the then outstanding amounts
expended by the Lessor for the project. In the event the subsidiary chooses not to extend the lease or acquire the project, Con Edison has guaranteed a residual value of the Newington Project for an
amount not to exceed $239.7 million. The subsidiary also has contingent payment obligations to the Lessor if an event of default should occur during the lease period. If the subsidiary were to
default, its obligation would equal up to 100% of the Lessor's investment in the Newington Project plus all other amounts then due under the lease, which could exceed the aforementioned residual value
guarantee. The subsidiary's payment and performance obligations relating to the Newington Project are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Con Edison.

Future
minimum rental payments under the Newington Project operating lease are as follows:

(Millions of Dollars)

All years thereafter


Total

$


At
December 31, 2003, Con Edison included $339 million of assets related to the Newington Project and $344 million of long-term debt and other liabilities on its
consolidated balance sheet. In addition, Con Edison recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle after-tax charge of $5 million.

Substantial
completion on the Newington project occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. The subsidiary and the construction contractor for this plant have initiated legal proceedings with respect to
whether the


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

subsidiary
is entitled to damages for a delay in completion of this plant and whether the contractor is entitled to additional project costs. Con Edison does not expect that this dispute will have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In
2001, Con Edison Solutions formed a partnership to own and operate a cogeneration facility that was accounted for under the equity method. The plant became fully operational in early 2002. Upon the
adoption of FIN 46, Con Edison Solutions included $2 million of the cogeneration facility's assets and the related debt on its consolidated balance sheet with no earnings impact.

Con
Edison Development has a sole limited interest in an affordable housing partnership which began in August 2000. Under FIN 46, the partnership was determined to be a VIE where Con Edison
Development is not the primary beneficiary. The partnership was established to acquire economic interests in residential housing rental properties expected to qualify for tax credits under
Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. At December 31, 2003, Con Edison Development's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIE was
$7 million. In addition, Con Edison has guaranteed the amounts of the debt undertaken by the partnership. See Note S.

Note U - Related Party Transactions

The Utilities and Con Edison's other subsidiaries provide administrative and other services to each other pursuant to cost allocation procedures approved by the
PSC. For O&R the services received include substantially all administrative support operations, such as corporate directorship and associated ministerial duties, accounting, treasury, investor
relations, information resources, legal, human resources, fuel supply and energy management services. The costs of administrative and other services provided by, and received from, Con Edison and its
subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:

respectively. O&R purchased from Con Edison of New York $16 million and $25 million of electricity for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. O&R also purchased
from Con Edison Energy $1 million of electricity for the year ended December 31, 2003.

In
December 2003, the FERC authorized Con Edison of New York to lend funds to O&R, for periods of not more than 12 months, in amounts not to exceed $150 million outstanding at any
time, at prevailing market rates. O&R has not borrowed any funds from Con Edison of New York.

Note V - New Financial Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN
46). For discussion of FIN 46, see Note T.

In
January 2003, the Companies adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." See "Plant and Depreciation—Utility Plant" in Note A.

SFAS
No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which was effective in January 2003, requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companies' financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

In
June 2003, the FASB issued final guidance on the use of broad market indices in power purchase and sale contracts (Derivatives Implementation Group Issue C20). In particular, this guidance
clarifies whether the pricing in a contract that contains broad market indices (e.g., consumer price index) could qualify as a normal purchase or normal sale scope exception and therefore not be
subject to fair value accounting under SFAS No. 133. The guidance became effective in the fourth quarter of 2003. Upon implementation of this guidance, Con Edison recognized to fair value
certain power sales contracts at Con Edison Development. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was an increase to net income of $8 million.

In
June 2003, the Companies adopted SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which amends and clarifies financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments, and SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," which revises and expands the
definition of a liability (FASB Concept Statement No. 5, "Elements of Financial Statements") and provides accounting and reporting guidance. Effective July 1, 2003, the Companies adopted
EITF 01-8,

"

Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease." The adoption of SFAS No. 149, SFAS
No. 150 and EITF 01-8, had no material impact on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In
August 2003, the EITF reached a consensus that realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not "held for trading purposes" should be reported on a net or gross basis based on the
relevant facts and circumstances of the contract

.

In analyzing these facts and circumstances, Issue 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a
Principal versus Net as an Agent," should be applied. The EITF consensus is effective for new transactions or arrangements entered into beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003. The adoption of this
EITF consensus had no material impact on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In
January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106-1, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003." The FSP gives plan sponsors an option to defer recognizing the effects of the Act in the accounting for its plan under FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement


NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

Benefits
Other Than Pensions," and in providing disclosures required by FASB Statement No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," until authoritative
guidance is issued, or until certain other events (such as plan amendments) occur. Con Edison has elected not to defer the recognition of the Act. See Note F.

Note W - East 11

th

Street Accident

In January 2004, a woman died when she came into contact with the metal frame of a Con Edison of New York service box that had been installed in a New
York City street. The frame was energized by a low voltage cable that in January 2003 was repaired by the company in a manner that varied from its written procedures. Following this accident,
the company began "stray-voltage" inspection testing of its transformer vaults, manholes and service boxes in the portion of its service area in which its distribution facilities are underground. The
company also tested certain of the City's Department of Transportation's street lights. The company has substantially completed this testing and has eliminated stray voltage conditions at the few
locations tested where there was measurable voltage. The company has committed to add this testing to its annual inspection programs.

In
February 2004, the PSC instituted a proceeding as to whether Con Edison of New York violated the safety requirements of the New York Public Service Law and ordered the company to show cause
why the PSC should not commence an action seeking penalties from the company. The PSC also instituted a proceeding to examine the safety of the company's electric transmission and distribution systems
and ordered the company to complete testing for stray voltage and any necessary repair of additional equipment in the company's service area.

Con
Edison of New York believes that its utility systems are safe and reliable. The company, however, is unable to predict whether or not any proceedings or other actions relating to this accident
will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Companies maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports
that they submit to the Securities Exchange


Commission
(SEC) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. For each of the Companies, its management, with the participation
of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such
evaluation, has concluded that the controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance. Reasonable assurance is not absolute assurance, however, and there can be no assurance
that any design of controls or procedures would be effective under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

There
were no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors during the last quarter of 2003 that could significantly affect internal controls.
