PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Exxon Mobil Corporation, formerly named Exxon Corporation, was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1882. On November 30, 1999, Mobil Corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exxon Corporation, and Exxon changed its name to
Exxon Mobil Corporation.

Divisions and affiliated companies of
ExxonMobil operate or market products in the United States and about 200 other countries and territories. Their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products
and transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. ExxonMobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of basic petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of
specialty products. ExxonMobil also has interests in electric power generation facilities. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses.

Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include

ExxonMobil, Exxon,
Esso

or

Mobil

. For convenience and simplicity, in this report the terms

ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso

and

Mobil

, as well as terms like

Corporation, Company, our, we

and

its

, are sometimes used as abbreviated
references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question.

Throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on the air, water and
ground. This includes a significant investment in refining technology to manufacture low-sulfur motor fuels and projects to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions. ExxonMobil’s 2004 worldwide environmental costs for all such
preventative and remediation steps were about $2.9 billion, of which $1.1 billion were capital expenditures and $1.8 billion were included in expenses. The total cost for such activities is expected to be about $3.0 billion in 2005
(with capital expenditures representing just over 40 percent of the total) and a similar amount is expected for 2006.

Operating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained on pages 75, 76, 88 and 89; information on oil and gas reserves is
contained on pages 82 through 85 and information on Company-sponsored research and development activities is contained on page 57 of the Financial Section of this report.

The number of regular employees was 85.9 thousand, 88.3 thousand and 92.5 thousand at years ended 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and
programs. Regular employees do not include employees of the company-operated retail sites (CORS). The number of CORS employees was 19.3 thousand, 17.4 thousand and 16.8 thousand at years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

ExxonMobil maintains a website at www.exxonmobil.com. Our annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made available through our website as soon
as reasonably practical after we electronically file or furnish the reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also available on the Corporation’s website are the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct, as well as the charters of the audit, compensation and nominating committees of the board of directors. All of these documents are available in print without charge to shareholders who request them. Information on our website is
not incorporated into this report.

Factors Affecting Future Results

Competitive Factors:

The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. There is
competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of various goods or services in
many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes. A key component of the Corporation’s competitive position, particularly given the commodity-based nature of many
of its products, is its ability to manage expenses successfully, which requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency.

Political Factors:

The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates
throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political instability and by other political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on
production, imports and exports; war or other international conflicts; civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten the safe operation of company facilities; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of
property; cancellation of contract rights; and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.

Industry and Economic Factors:

The operations
and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world are affected by local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and other ExxonMobil
products. These events or conditions are generally not predictable and include, among other things, general economic growth rates and the occurrence of economic recessions; the development of new supply sources; adherence by countries to OPEC
quotas; supply disruptions; weather, including seasonal patterns that affect energy demand and severe weather events that can disrupt operations; technological advances, including advances in exploration, production, refining, and petrochemical
manufacturing technology and advances in technology relating to energy usage; changes in demographics, including population growth rates and consumer preferences; and the competitiveness of alternative hydrocarbon or other energy sources or product
substitutes.

Project
Factors:

In addition to the factors cited above, the advancement, cost and results of particular ExxonMobil projects depend on the outcome of negotiations with partners, governments, suppliers, customers or others; changes
in operating conditions or costs; changes in rates of field decline; and the occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties. See section 1 of Item 2 of this report for discussion of additional factors affecting future capacity growth and the timing
and ultimate recovery of reserves.

Market Risk
Factors:

See pages 39 and 40 of the Financial Section of this report for discussion of the impact of market risks, inflation and other uncertainties.

Projections, estimates and descriptions of ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in Items 1, 2, 7
and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors
discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

Item 2.

Properties.

Part of the information in response to this item and to the Securities Exchange Act Industry Guide 2 is contained in the Financial Section of this report in Note 9, which note appears on page 59, and on pages 78
through 87.

Information with regard to oil and gas producing activities
follows:

1.

Net Reserves of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas at Year-End 2004

Estimated proved
reserves are shown on pages 82 through 85 of the Financial Section of this report. No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2004, that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as
of that date, with the exception of bitumen prices in western Canada which have increased substantially from December 31. This price increase resulted in the rebooking, in 2005, of approximately 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels at the Cold Lake
field. For information on the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves, see pages 86 and 87 of the Financial Section of this report.

The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each
geographic area for consolidated subsidiaries as detailed on pages 82 through 85 of the Financial Section of this report for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Corporation has reported 2004 proved reserves on the basis of December 31, 2004 prices
and costs for the first time. Gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels.

Additional detail on
developed and undeveloped oil-equivalent proved reserves is shown in the table below.



Index to Financial Statements

In the preceding reserves information, and in the reserves tables on pages 82 through 85 of the Financial
Section of this report, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation operates its business with the same views of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.

The Corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook, based
on projects coming on stream as anticipated, is for production capacity increases to average 3 percent annually through 2010. However, actual volume increases will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational
outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described under the heading “Factors Affecting Future Results” in Item 1 of this report.

The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of
reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines. In certain deepwater fields, proved reserves are recorded in a limited
number of cases before flow tests are conducted because of the safety and cost implications of conducting the tests. In those situations, other industry accepted analyses are used such as information from well logs, a thorough pressure and fluid
sampling program, conventional core data obtained across the entire reservoir interval and nearby analog data. Historically, proved reserves recorded using these methods have been immaterial when compared to the Corporation’s total proved
reserves and have also been validated by subsequent flow tests or actual production levels. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the
development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir
performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of long term oil and gas price levels.

2.    Estimates of Total Net Proved Oil and Gas Reserves Filed with Other Federal Agencies

During 2004, ExxonMobil filed proved reserves estimates with the U.S.
Department of Energy on Forms EIA-23 and EIA-28. The information on Form EIA-28 is presented on the same basis as the registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003, which shows ExxonMobil’s net interests in all liquids and gas reserve
volumes and changes thereto from both ExxonMobil-operated properties and properties operated by others. The data on Form EIA-23, although consistent with the data on Form EIA-28, is presented on a different basis, and includes 100 percent of
the oil and gas volumes from ExxonMobil-operated properties only, regardless of the company’s net interest. In addition, Form EIA-23 information does not include gas plant liquids. The difference between the oil reserves reported on EIA-23
and those reported in the registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003 exceeds five percent. The difference in gas reserves did not exceed five percent.

3.    Average Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production

Reference is made to pages 78 and 79 of the Financial Section of this
report. Average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor. Average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor. The volumes of
crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table on page 83 of the Financial Section of this report. The volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of
natural gas available for sale and thus are different from those shown in the reserves table on page 84 of the Financial Section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. The volumes of natural gas were converted to oil-equivalent barrels
based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel.

4.    Gross and Net Productive Wells

The numbers of wells
operated at year-end 2004 were 18,427 gross wells and 15,216 net wells. At year-end 2003, the numbers of operated wells were 20,174 gross wells and 16,610 net wells.

5.    Gross and Net Developed Acreage

Note: Separate
acreage data for oil and gas are not maintained because, in many instances, both are produced from the same acreage.

6.    Gross and Net Undeveloped Acreage

ExxonMobil’s
investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. The terms and conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production rights to the acreage are property-specific,
contractually-defined and vary significantly. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of
the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in
obtaining extensions.

7.     Summary of Acreage Terms in Key Areas

UNITED STATES

Oil and gas leases have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains
in effect until production ceases. In some instances, a “fee interest” is acquired where both the surface and the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.

CANADA

Exploration permits are granted for varying periods of time with renewals possible. Production leases are held as long as there is production on the
lease. The majority of Cold Lake leases were taken for an initial 21-year term in 1968-1969 and renewed for a second 21-year term in 1989-1990. The exploration acreage in eastern Canada is currently held by work commitments of various amounts.

EUROPE

France

Exploration permits are granted for periods of three to five years, and are renewable up to two times accompanied by substantial acreage relinquishments:
50 percent of the acreage at first renewal; 25 percent of the remaining acreage at second renewal. A 1994 law requires a bidding process prior to granting of an exploration permit. Upon discovery of commercial hydrocarbons, a production concession
is granted for up to 50 years, renewable in periods of 25 years each.

Germany

Exploration concessions are granted
for an initial maximum period of five years with possible extensions of up to three years for an indefinite period. Extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with
multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license.

Netherlands

Under the
new Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated
in the Mining Law.

Exploration and production rights granted
prior to January 1, 2003 remain subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas.

Onshore:  Exploration licenses were issued for a period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license was issued. Production
concessions are granted after discoveries have been made, under conditions that are negotiated with the government. Normally, they are field-life concessions covering an area defined by hydrocarbon occurrences.

Offshore:  Exploration licenses issued between 1976 and 1996 were
for a ten-year period, with relinquishment of about 50 percent of the original area required at the end of six years. Exploration licenses granted after that time were for a period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the permit was
issued. Production licenses are normally issued for a 40-year period.

Norway

Licenses issued prior to 1972 were for
an initial period of six years and an extension period of 40 years, with relinquishment of at least one-fourth of the original area required at the end of the sixth



Index to Financial Statements

year and another one-fourth at the end of the ninth year. Licenses issued between 1972 and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years (with extension
of the initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985), and an extension period of up to 30 years, with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the end of the initial period. Licenses issued after July
1, 1997 have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years, and with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the end of the initial period.

United Kingdom

Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For
example, the regulations governing licenses issued between 1996 and 1998 provided for an initial term of three years with possible extensions of six, 15 and 24 years for a license period of 45 more years. After the second extension, the license must
be surrendered in part. Licenses issued in 2002 as part of the 20th licensing round have an initial term of four years with a second term extension of four years. There is a mandatory relinquishment of all acreage that is not covered by a
development plan at the end of the second term.

ASIA PACIFIC

Australia

Exploration and production activities are conducted offshore and are
governed by Federal legislation. Exploration permits granted before January 1, 2003 were issued for six years with three possible five-year renewal periods. Exploration permits granted after that date are issued for six years with two possible
five-year renewal periods. A 50 percent relinquishment of remaining area is mandatory at the end of each renewal period. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to
become commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to September 1998, production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and
thereafter renewals at the discretion of the Joint Authority, comprising Federal and State Ministers. Effective from September 1998, new production licenses are granted “indefinitely”, i.e., for the life of the field (if no operations for
the recovery of petroleum have been carried on for five years, the license may be terminated).

Indonesia

Exploration
and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a production sharing contract, negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities.
Formerly this activity was carried out by Pertamina, the government owned oil company, which is now a competing limited liability company.

Japan

The Mining Law provides for the granting of concessions that convey exploration and production rights. Exploration rights are granted for an initial
two-year period, and may be extended for two two-year periods for gas and three two-year periods for oil. Production rights have no fixed term and continue until abandonment so long as the rights holder is fulfilling its obligations.

Malaysia

Exploration and production activities are governed by production sharing
contracts negotiated with the national oil company. The more recent contracts have an overall term of 24 to 38 years with



Index to Financial Statements

possible extensions to the exploration and/or development periods. The exploration period is five to seven years with the possibility of extensions, after
which time areas with no commercial discoveries will be deemed relinquished. The development period is from four to six years from commercial discovery, with the possibility of extensions under special circumstances. Areas from which commercial
production has not started by the end of the development period will be deemed relinquished if no extension is granted. All extensions are subject to the national oil company’s prior written approval. The total production period is 15 to 25
years from first commercial lifting, not to exceed the overall term of the contract.

Papua New Guinea

Exploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum Prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term of six years with a five-year extension possible. Generally, a 50 percent relinquishment of the
license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended. Petroleum Development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the Minister’s discretion. Petroleum
Retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may become commercially viable. Petroleum Retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be extended twice for a
maximum retention time of 15 years.

Russia

Acreage terms are fixed by the production sharing agreement (PSA) that
became effective in 1996 between the Russian government and the Sakhalin I consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the operator. The term of the PSA is 20 years from the Declaration of Commerciality, which would be 2021. The term may be extended
thereafter in 10-year increments as specified in the PSA.

Thailand

The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows
production under ExxonMobil’s concession for 30 years with a possible ten-year extension at terms generally prevalent at the time.

AFRICA

Angola

Exploration and
production activities are governed by production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years and an optional second phase of two to three years. The production period is for 25 years and agreements generally provide for a
negotiated extension.

Cameroon

Exploration and production activities are governed by various agreements
negotiated with the national oil company and the government of Cameroon. Exploration permits are granted for terms from four to 16 years and are generally renewable for multiple periods up to four years each. Upon commercial discovery, mining
concessions are issued for a period of 25 years with one 25-year extension.

Chad

Exploration
permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated Convention. The production term
is for 30 years and may be extended at the discretion of the government.



Index to Financial Statements

Equatorial Guinea

Exploration and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of
Mines and Energy. The exploration periods are for ten to 15 years with limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries. The production period for crude oil is 30 years while the production period for gas is 50 years.

Nigeria

Exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts
(PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a
ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase plus one or two optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the ten-year
exploration period, and OMLs have a 20-year production period that may be extended.

Some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years and are non-renewable, while in all
other areas the licenses are for five years and also are non-renewable. Demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.

OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the 1969 Petroleum Act) were for 30 years onshore and 40
years in offshore areas and are renewable upon 12 months’ written notice, for further periods of 30 and 40 years, respectively. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted under a joint venture agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC.

OMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include all
deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months’ written notice, for another period of 20 years. OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject to a mandatory 50
percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their duration.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) defining commercial terms applicable to existing joint venture oil production was renegotiated and executed in 2000. The MOU is effective for a minimum of three years with possible extensions on mutual
agreement and is terminable on one calendar year’s notice.

SOUTH
AMERICA

Argentina

The onshore concession terms in Argentina are up to four years for the
initial exploration period, up to three years for the second exploration period and up to two years for the third exploration period. A 50 percent relinquishment is required after each exploration period. An extension after the third exploration
period is possible for up to five years. The total production term is 25 years with a ten-year extension possible, once a field has been developed.

Venezuela

Exploration and production activities are governed by contracts negotiated with the national oil company. Exploration activity is covered by risk/profit
sharing contracts where exploration blocks are awarded for 35 years. Production licenses are awarded for 20 years under production service agreements.



Index to Financial Statements

Strategic association agreements (such as the Cerro Negro project) are typically limited to those
projects that require vertical integration for extra heavy crude oil. Contracts are awarded for 35 years. Significant amendments to the contract terms require Venezuelan congressional approval.

MIDDLE EAST

Qatar

The State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to permit the economic
development and production of gas reserves sufficient to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects.

Republic of Yemen

Production sharing agreements (PSAs) negotiated with the government entitle the company to participate in exploration operations within a designated area
during the exploration period. In the event of a commercial oil discovery, the company is entitled to proceed with development and production operations during the development period. The length of these periods and other specific terms are
negotiated prior to executing the PSA. Existing production operations have a development period extending 20 years from first commercial declaration made in November 1985 for the Marib PSA and June 1995 for the Jannah PSA.

United Arab Emirates

Exploration and production activities in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi are
governed by a 75-year oil concession agreement executed in 1939 and subsequently amended through various agreements with the government of Abu Dhabi.

CASPIAN

Azerbaijan

The
production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field (commonly known as the Megastructure) is established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994.

Other exploration and production activities are governed by PSAs negotiated
with the national oil company of Azerbaijan. The exploration period consists of three or four years with the possibility of a one to three-year extension. The production period, which includes development, is for 25 years or 35 years with the
possibility of one or two five-year extensions.

Kazakhstan

Onshore:  Exploration and production activities
are governed by the production license, exploration license and joint venture agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.

Offshore:  Exploration and production activities are governed by a
production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years with possible extensions. The production period, which includes development, is for 20 years with the possibility of two ten-year
extensions.

B.    Review of Principal Ongoing Activities in Key Areas

During 2004, ExxonMobil’s activities were conducted,
either directly or through affiliated companies, by ExxonMobil Exploration Company (for exploration), by ExxonMobil Development Company (for large development activities), by ExxonMobil Production Company (for producing and smaller development
activities) and by ExxonMobil Gas & Power Marketing Company (for gas marketing). During this same period, some of ExxonMobil’s exploration, development, production and gas marketing activities were also conducted in Canada by the Resources
Division of Imperial Oil Limited, which is 69.6 percent owned by ExxonMobil.

Some of the more significant ongoing activities are set forth below:

UNITED STATES

Exploration and delineation of additional hydrocarbon resources continued in 2004. At year-end 2004, ExxonMobil’s acreage totaled 12.5 million net acres, of which 3.3 million net acres were offshore. ExxonMobil was active in areas
onshore and offshore in the lower 48 states and in Alaska. A total of 16.6 net exploration and delineation wells were completed during 2004.

During 2004, 542.5 net development wells were completed within and around mature fields in the inland lower 48 states and 8.0 net development wells were
completed offshore in the Pacific. Construction continued on an acid gas injection project to increase existing plant capacity at the Shute Creek treating facility in La Barge, Wyoming, and tight gas development has been initiated in the Piceance
Basin in Colorado. Participation in Alaska production and development continued and a total of 21.8 net development wells were drilled. On Alaska’s North Slope, activity continued on the Western Region Development Project (primarily the Orion
field) with development drilling and conceptual engineering for facility expansions.

ExxonMobil’s net acreage in the Gulf of Mexico at year-end 2004 was 3.1 million acres. A total of 8.1 net development wells were completed during the year and development continued on several Gulf of Mexico
projects. Production began from the South Diana subsea deepwater field in March 2004. Production began from the first phase of the Llano subsea development in May 2004. Hull construction was completed and topsides construction continued on the
semi-submersible production and drilling vessel for the Thunder Horse development.

CANADA

ExxonMobil’s year-end 2004
acreage holdings totaled 8.5 million net acres, of which 4.1 million net acres were offshore. A total of 474.4 net exploration and development wells were completed during the year.

Gross production from Cold Lake averaged 126 thousand barrels per day during 2004. In eastern Canada, the South Venture
field of the Sable Offshore Energy Project came online.

EUROPE

France

ExxonMobil’s acreage at year-end 2004 was 0.1 million net onshore
acres, with 1.0 net exploration and development well completed during the year.



Index to Financial Statements

Germany

A total of 2.3 million net onshore acres and 0.2 million net offshore acres were held by ExxonMobil at year-end 2004, with 4.3 net exploration and
development wells completed during the year.

Netherlands

Information with regard to mining activities follows

:

Syncrude Operations

Syncrude is a joint-venture established to recover shallow deposits of tar
sands using open-pit mining methods, to extract the crude bitumen, and to produce a high-quality, light (32 degree API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. The Syncrude operation, located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, exploits a portion of the
Athabasca Oil Sands Deposit. The location is readily accessible by public road. The produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the Syncrude site to Edmonton, Alberta by Alberta Oil Sands Pipeline Ltd. Since start-up in 1978, Syncrude has produced
about 1.5 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint-venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited.

Operating License and Leases

Syncrude has an operating license issued by the Province of Alberta which is
effective until 2035. This license permits Syncrude to mine tar sands and produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on tar sands leases. Syncrude holds eight tar sands leases covering approximately 252,000 acres in the Athabasca
Oil Sands Deposit which were issued by the Province of Alberta. The leases are automatically renewable as long as tar sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan. Syncrude leases 10, 12, 17, 22 and 34
(containing proven reserves) and leases 29, 30 and 31 (containing no proven reserves) are included within a development plan approved by the Province of Alberta. There were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the
start-up of operations in 1978.

Operations, Plant and
Equipment

Operations at Syncrude involve three main
processes: open pit mining, extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude oil. In the Base mine (lease 17), the mining and transportation system uses draglines, bucketwheel reclaimers and belt conveyors. In the



Index to Financial Statements

North mine (leases 17 and 22) and in the Aurora mine (leases 10, 12 and 34), truck, shovel and hydrotransport systems are used. Production from the Aurora
mine commenced in 2000. The extraction facilities, which separates crude bitumen from sand, are capable of processing approximately 545,000 tons of tar sands a day, producing 110 million barrels of crude bitumen a year. This represents recovery
capability of about 92 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined tar sands.

Crude bitumen extracted from tar sands is refined to a marketable hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in two large, high-temperature, fluid-coking vessels and by hydrogen addition in
high-temperature, high-pressure, hydrocracking vessels. These processes remove carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity, low sulfur, high-quality synthetic crude oil product. In 2004, this upgrading process yielded 0.855
barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen. In 2004 about 46 percent of the synthetic crude oil was processed by Edmonton area refineries and the remaining 54 percent was pipelined to refineries in eastern Canada and exported,
primarily to the United States. Electricity is provided to Syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and an 80 megawatt electricity generating plant, both located at Syncrude. The generating plants are owned by the Syncrude
participants. Imperial Oil Limited’s 25 percent share of net investment in plant, property and equipment, including surface mining facilities, transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was about $2.3 billion at year end 2004.

Synthetic Crude Oil Reserves

The crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the
McMurray Formation. Ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden, have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of 115 to 160 feet. Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological
and engineering assessments of in-place crude bitumen volume, the mining plan, historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The in-place volume, depth and grade are
established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling. Proven reserves include the operating Base and North mines and the Aurora mine. In accordance with the approved mining plan, there are an estimated 2,055 million tons of extractable tar
sands in the Base and North mines, with an average bitumen grade of 10.6 weight percent. In addition, at the Aurora mine, there are an estimated 4,470 million tons of extractable tar sands at an average bitumen grade of 11.1 weight percent. After
deducting royalties payable to the Province of Alberta, Imperial Oil Limited estimates that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at year end 2004 was equivalent to 757 million barrels of synthetic crude oil.

In 2001, the Syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the Syncrude
resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities. The Syncrude Aurora 2 and Upgrader Expansion 1 project adds a remote mining train and expands the central processing and upgrading plant. This expansion is under way and will lead to
total production of about 350 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day (gross) when completed.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

Listed below are
definitions of several of ExxonMobil’s key business financial performance measures. These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of subsidiaries, investments and
property, plant and equipment from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow is the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing
disciplined regular review process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic and financial objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to
others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities, including shareholder distributions.

CAPITAL EMPLOYED

Capital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the
capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil’s net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital
employed in total for the Corporation, it includes ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and shareholders’ equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the Corporation believes
should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.



Index to Financial Statements

RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED

Return on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual
business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our
capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is net income excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied
its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that capital has
been used wisely over the long term. Additional measures, which tend to be more cash flow based, are used for future investment decisions.

“All other financing costs – net” in 2003 includes interest income (after
tax) associated with the settlement of a U.S. tax dispute.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Index to Financial Statements

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements in this
discussion regarding expectations, plans and future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including production growth; financing sources; the resolution of contingencies; the effect of changes in prices;
interest rates and other market conditions; and environmental and capital expenditures could differ materially depending on a number of factors, such as the outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil,
natural gas, and petroleum and petrochemical products; and other factors discussed herein and under the caption “Factors Affecting Future Results” in Item 1 of ExxonMobil’s 2004 Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

The following discussion and analysis
of ExxonMobil’s financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The
Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the extracting, refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. The Corporation’s business model involves
the production (or purchase), manufacture and sale of physical products, and all commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical movement of goods.

This straightforward approach extends to the financing of the business. In evaluating business or investment opportunities,
the Corporation views as economically equivalent any debt obligation, whether included on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, or disclosed as other debt-like obligations in notes to the financial statements, such as ExxonMobil’s share
of equity company debt and noncancelable, long-term operating leases. This consistent, conservative approach to financing the capital-intensive needs of the Corporation has helped ExxonMobil to sustain the “triple-A” status of its
long-term debt securities for 86 years.

ExxonMobil, with its
resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new energy supplies. While commodity prices remain volatile on a short-term basis
depending on supply and demand, ExxonMobil’s investment decisions are based on our long-term outlook, using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities. The corporate plan is a fundamental
annual management process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and capital objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. Annual volumes are based on individual field
production profiles, which are also updated annually. Prices for natural gas and other products are based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and used for investment evaluation purposes. Potential investment
opportunities are tested over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of each opportunity. Once investments are made, a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated
into future projects. ExxonMobil views return on capital employed as the best measure of historical capital productivity.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

Upstream

The Corporation expects worldwide economic growth to average just under 3
percent per year through 2030. This growth, and rising personal incomes notably in developing nations, should increase global energy demand by 1.7 percent per year, reaching 50 percent more than today by 2030. Oil, natural gas and coal are expected
to remain the predominant fuels through the middle of the century. The share of oil and gas in the world’s energy supply, close to 60 percent today, should remain relatively stable, and total fossil fuels, including coal, will account for about
80 percent of the energy mix. In the very long term, the energy mix will likely become more diversified. However, for the foreseeable future, fossil fuels are the only energy forms with the scale and versatility to meet the challenge of growing
world energy demand.

Oil demand should grow at 1.5 percent per
year, with increasing use of oil in the transportation sector. However, natural gas is expected to be the fastest-growing primary energy source, capturing about 30 percent of the growth in total energy demand, and reaching one quarter of the total
energy supply. About half of the growth in gas demand will likely be to meet worldwide electricity demand that is expected to double by 2030. The Corporation expects the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market to quadruple, helping to meet rising import
dependency in Europe, North America and Asia. With equity positions in many of the largest remote gas accumulations in the world, the Corporation is positioned to benefit from its technology advances in gas liquefaction, transportation and
regasification that enable distant gas supplies to reach markets economically.

On average, the world’s oil and gas fields are declining in production at between 4 percent and 6 percent per year. While large resources exist, technology advances remain critical to increasing future oil and
gas supplies. Emerging technologies promise to further advance our capability to extend recoverable resources worldwide. The cost to develop these resources is also very large. According to the International Energy Agency, the investment required to
meet total oil and gas energy needs worldwide through 2030 will be about $200 billion per year.

ExxonMobil maintains the largest portfolio of exploration and development opportunities among the international oil companies, which enables the
selectivity required to optimize total profitability and mitigate overall political and technical risks. As future development projects bring new resources on line, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix of production volumes between
now and 2010. For example, oil and natural gas output from West Africa, the Caspian, the Middle East and Russia will more than double during the next six years based on current capital project execution plans. Currently, these growth areas account
for less than 20 percent of the Corporation’s production. By the end of the decade, they are expected to generate about 40 percent of total volumes. Production from established areas, including Europe and North America, will decline as a
percentage of the Corporation’s total production but still is expected to represent over half of 2010 volumes.

In addition to a changing geographic mix, there will also be a change in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Production using
arctic technology, deepwater drilling and production systems, heavy oil recovery processes and LNG is expected to grow from 20 percent to 40 percent of the Corporation’s output between now and 2010. The Corporation’s overall volume
capacity outlook, based on projects coming on stream as anticipated, is for production capacity

increases to average 3 percent annually through 2010. However, actual volume increases will vary from year to year due to timing of individual project
start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors described under the caption “Factors Affecting Future Results” in Item 1 of ExxonMobil’s 2004
Form l0-K.

Restructuring of our European gas marketing
operations has progressed in anticipation of the impact of the European Gas Directives. Part of this effort includes a Heads of Agreement (HOA) whereby Esso Nederland B.V. and Shell Nederland B.V. will agree to transfer their ownership share of 25
percent each in Gasunie’s gas transportation business to the State of the Netherlands. As specified in the HOA, the State of the Netherlands will pay a total net compensation in the amount of 2.78 billion Euros to the Dutch company Nederlandse
Aardolie Maatschappij B.V., jointly owned by ExxonMobil and Shell. The parties intend to finalize the restructuring by mid-2005, and it is anticipated that, at that time, this step will have a positive impact on the Corporation’s results. The
restructuring will position ExxonMobil to compete effectively in the future European gas market and enable us to directly sell more of our equity production.

Downstream

The downstream industry environment remains very competitive. Long-term real refining margins have historically declined at a rate of about 2 percent per year and the intense competition in the retail fuels market has
driven long-term real margins down by 4 percent per year. The outlook is for modest industry growth in mature markets with increasing requirements for regulatory investments.

Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil)
and the market prices for the range of products produced (primarily gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel and fuel oil). Crude oil and many products are widely traded with published prices, including those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world
(e.g., New York Mercantile Exchange and International Petroleum Exchange). Prices for these commodities (crude and various products) are determined by the global marketplace and are impacted by many industry factors, including global and regional
supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export balances, seasonality and weather. These prices and factors are continuously monitored and serve as input to decisions about which raw materials to buy, facilities to
operate and products to make. However, there are no reliable indicators of future market factors that accurately predict changes in margins from period to period.

The objectives of ExxonMobil’s Downstream strategies are to position the Corporation to be the industry leader and
outperform competition under a variety of market conditions. These strategies include maintaining best-in-class operations in all respects, maximizing value from leading-edge technology, capitalizing on integration with other ExxonMobil businesses
and providing quality, valued products and services to the Corporation’s customers. ExxonMobil has an ownership interest in 45 refineries, located in 25 countries, with distillation capacity of 6.4 million barrels per day and lubricant
basestock manufacturing capacity of about 145 thousand barrels per day. ExxonMobil’s fuels marketing business portfolio includes operations in over 100 countries on six continents, serving a globally diverse customer base. World-class scale and
integration, industry-leading efficiency, leading-edge technology and globally respected brands enable ExxonMobil to take advantage of attractive emerging-growth opportunities around the globe. For example, our assets are well-positioned and
configured to supply demand growth in Asia Pacific, which we estimate will be 3 percent annually through 2020.

Chemical

The strength of the global
economy supported strong demand growth for petrochemical products in 2004. Demand growth in Asia benefited from continued economic and industrial production growth, and the North American market recovered from weak conditions in 2003. Growth in
Europe was moderate, consistent with the less favorable economic environment. As a result of strong demand growth and limited new capacity additions, regional and global supply demand balances tightened, supporting higher prices and margins despite
increased feedstock costs. ExxonMobil’s portfolio includes many of the largest-volume and highest-growth petrochemicals in the global economy. In addition to being a worldwide supplier of primary petrochemical products, the Corporation also has
a diverse portfolio of less cyclical business lines. The Corporation’s competitive advantages are achieved through its business mix, investment discipline, integration of chemical capacity with large refining complexes or upstream gas
processing, operational excellence, including leading proprietary technology, and product application expertise.

REVIEW OF 2004 AND 2003 RESULTS


Net income in 2004 of $25,330 million was the highest ever for the Corporation, up $3,820
million from 2003. Net income in 2004 included a one-time special charge of $550 million relating to the Allapattah lawsuit provision. Interest expense in 2004 increased to $638 million compared to $207 million in 2003, reflecting the interest
component of the Allapattah lawsuit provision.

Total assets at
December 31, 2004, of $195 billion increased by approximately $21 billion from 2003, reflecting strong earnings and the Corporation’s active investment program, particularly in the Upstream.


Net income in 2003 was $21,510 million, an increase of $10,050 million from 2002. Excluding a $550 million positive impact for the required
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (FAS 143) relating to accounting for asset retirement obligations, income from continuing operations was $20,960 million. 2003 net income also included one-time special items of $2,230
million relating to the positive settlement of a long-running U.S. tax dispute and $1,700 million from a gain on the transfer of shares in Ruhrgas AG, a German gas transmission company. Interest expense in 2003 was $207 million compared to $398
million in 2002, reflecting lower debt levels and nondebt-related items.



Index to Financial Statements

Total assets at December 31, 2003, of $174 billion increased by approximately $22 billion from 2002,
reflecting the Corporation’s active investment program and the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar.

Upstream


Upstream earnings of $16,675 million increased $2,173 million due to higher liquids and
natural gas realizations. Upstream earnings for 2003 included a $1,700 million special item from a gain on the transfer of shares in Ruhrgas AG. Absent this, Upstream earnings increased $3,873 million in 2004. Oil-equivalent production was up 3
percent versus 2003 excluding price-related entitlement effects and divestment impacts. Including these impacts, total oil-equivalent production was flat with 2003. Liquids production of 2,571 Kbd (thousands of barrels daily) increased 55 Kbd from
2003. Production increases in West Africa and Norway were partly offset by natural field decline in mature areas, entitlement effects and divestment impacts. Natural gas production of 9,864 mcfd (millions of cubic feet daily) in 2004 compared with
10,119 mcfd in 2003. The start-up of an additional LNG train in Qatar and contributions from projects and work programs were more than offset by natural field decline, divestment impacts and entitlement effects. Earnings from U.S. Upstream
operations for 2004 of $4,948 million were $1,043 million higher than 2003 due to higher realizations partly offset by lower production volumes. Earnings outside the U.S. for 2004 of $11,727 million were $1,130 million higher than 2003 due to
improved realizations and higher production volumes. Earnings outside the U.S. for 2003 included a $1,700 million special item from a gain on the transfer of shares in Ruhrgas AG.


Upstream earnings totaled $14,502 million, including $1,700 million from a gain on the transfer of shares in Ruhrgas AG. Absent this, Upstream earnings increased by
$3,204 million from 2002 due to higher liquids and natural gas realizations. Total oil-equivalent production was down 1 percent. Liquids production of 2,516 Kbd increased 20 Kbd from 2002. Production increases from new projects in West Africa,
Norway and Canada, and lower OPEC-driven quota constraints, were partly offset by natural field decline, operational problems in the North Sea and West Africa and the impact of the national strike in Venezuela. Natural gas production of 10,119 mcfd
in 2003 compared with 10,452 mcfd in 2002. Higher demand in the first half of the year in Europe and contributions from new projects and work programs were more than offset by natural field decline, reduced entitlements and operational outages in
the North Sea. Improved earnings from both U.S. and non-U.S. Upstream operations were driven by higher liquids and natural gas realizations. Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2003 were $3,905 million, an increase of $1,381 million. Earnings
outside the U.S. for 2003, including $1,700 million from a gain on the transfer of shares in Ruhrgas AG, were $10,597 million. Earnings outside the U.S. for 2002, including a special charge of $215 million relating to a United Kingdom tax rate
change, were $7,074 million.

Downstream


Downstream earnings totaled $5,706 million, including a special charge of $550 million
relating to the Allapattah lawsuit provision. Absent this, Downstream earnings increased $2,740 million due to stronger worldwide refining margins and higher refinery throughput partly offset by weaker marketing margins. Earnings also benefited from
a planned reduction in inventories as a result of optimizing operations around the world. Petroleum product sales of 8,210 Kbd were 253 Kbd higher than 2003, largely related to increased refinery runs due to strong margins and more efficient
operations. Refinery throughput was 5,713 Kbd compared with 5,510 Kbd in 2003. U.S. Downstream earnings of $2,186 million, including the one-time special charge relating to the Allapattah lawsuit provision, increased by $838 million. Non-U.S.
Downstream earnings of $3,520 million were $1,352 million higher than 2003.


Downstream earnings of $3,516 million increased by
$2,216 million from 2002, reflecting higher worldwide refining and marketing margins. Earnings also benefited from a planned reduction in inventories as a result of optimizing operations around the world. Petroleum product sales of 7,957 Kbd were
200 Kbd higher than 2002, largely related to increased refinery runs due to strong margins and higher demand for distillates. Refinery throughput was 5,510 Kbd compared with 5,443 Kbd in 2002. U.S. Downstream earnings of $1,348 million increased by
$655 million, reflecting higher refining and marketing margins partly offset by increased refinery turnaround activity in the year. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $2,168 million were $1,561 million higher than 2002 due to higher refining and
marketing margins, increased refinery runs and positive inventory impacts.

Chemical


Chemical earnings of $3,428 million were up $1,996 million from 2003. Earnings benefited
from improved worldwide margins, higher volumes and favorable foreign exchange effects. Prime product sales were a record 27,788 kt (thousands of metric tons), an increase of 1,221 kt from 2003, reflecting improved worldwide demand. Prime product
sales are total chemical product sales including ExxonMobil’s share of equity company volumes and finished-product transfers to

the Downstream business. Carbon black oil and sulfur volumes are excluded. U.S. Chemical earnings of $1,020 million were $639 million higher than 2003 with
higher margins and increased volumes on improved demand. Non-U.S. Chemical earnings of $2,408 million were $1,357 million higher than 2003 due to higher margins, strong demand in Asia and favorable foreign exchange effects.


Chemical earnings of $1,432 million were up $602 million from 2002. Earnings benefited from improved worldwide margins and favorable foreign
exchange effects. Prime product sales of 26,567 kt were in line with sales of 26,606 kt in 2002. U.S. Chemical earnings of $381 million were $3 million lower than 2002 with higher margins offset by lower volumes on weaker demand. Non-U.S. Chemical
earnings of $1,051 million were $605 million higher than 2002 due to higher margins, strong demand in Asia and favorable foreign exchange effects.

All Other Segments


Corporate and financing expenses in 2004 were $479 million. The corporate and financing
segment contributed $1,510 million to earnings in 2003, including a special item of $2,230 million relating to the settlement of a long-running U.S. tax dispute. Excluding this special item, corporate and financing expenses were down $241 million
mainly due to lower U.S. pension expense.


All other segments totaled a gain of $2,060 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $268
million in 2002.

Corporate and financing in 2003, including
$2,230 million relating to the settlement of a long-running U.S. tax dispute, contributed $1,510 million to earnings. Excluding this settlement, corporate and financing expenses increased by $278 million mainly due to higher U.S. pension expense.

Net income in 2003 included a $550 million positive impact for
the required adoption of FAS 143 relating to accounting for asset retirement obligations.

Merger-related activities were completed in 2002 and net income included $275 million of merger-related expenses. Net income in 2002 also included discontinued operations earnings of $449 million, including a gain
associated with the sale of the Chilean copper business.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources and
Uses of Cash

Cash and cash equivalents were $18,531
million at the end of 2004, an increase of $7,905 million, including $532 million of foreign exchange rate effects from the generally weaker U.S. dollar. Including restricted cash and cash equivalents of $4,604 million (see note 4 on page 57 and
note 16 on page 70), total cash and cash equivalents of $23,135 million at the end of 2004 increased $12,509 million during the year. Cash and cash equivalents were $10,626 million at the end of 2003, an increase of $3,397 million, including $504
million of foreign exchange rate effects. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are discussed below. For additional details, see the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 53.

Although the Corporation issues long-term debt from time to time and
maintains a revolving commercial paper program, internally generated funds cover the majority of its financial requirements. The management of cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the Corporation’s immediate needs is carefully
controlled, both to optimize returns on cash balances, and to ensure that it is secure and readily available to meet the Corporation’s cash requirements as they arise.

Production from existing oil and gas fields has declined about 6 percent on average over the past two years and is expected
to continue to decline in the future at approximately the same rate. The impact on cash flows from production is highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Decline rates vary widely by individual field and the overall decline rate for a
geographical area will be heavily influenced by the type of reservoir and age of the fields in that region.

The Corporation will need to continually find and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to
existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production and resulting cash flows in future periods. The Corporation has been successful in offsetting the effects of field decline through these measures and anticipates similar results in the
future. Projects are in place or under way to increase production capacity. However, these volume increases are subject to a variety of risks including project execution, operational outages, reservoir performance, price effects on production
sharing contracts and regulatory changes.



Index to Financial Statements

The Corporation’s financial strength, as evidenced by its AAA/Aaa debt rating, enables it to make
large, long-term capital expenditures. ExxonMobil currently expects to spend approximately $12 billion annually through the end of the decade on Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. The Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of
development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and technical risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and diverse
portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation’s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed
commitments. The purchase and sale of oil and gas properties have not had a significant impact on the amount or timing of operating cash flows.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities


Cash provided by operating activities totaled $40.6 billion in 2004, a $12.1 billion increase from 2003. Major sources of funds were net income of $25.3 billion, which increased $3.8 billion, and noncash provisions of
$9.8 billion for depreciation and depletion. Contributing to the increased level of cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was $2.4 billion of lower company contributions to pension plans and $3.0 billion of cash received related to the U.S.
tax settlement recognized in earnings in 2003.


Cash provided by operating activities totaled $28.5 billion in 2003, a $7.2 billion increase
from 2002 influenced by higher net income. Major sources of funds were net income of $21.5 billion and noncash provisions of $9.0 billion for depreciation and depletion.

In 2003, ExxonMobil completed a divestment of interests in shares of Ruhrgas AG, a German gas transmission company. These
shares were held in part by BEB Erdgas und Erdoel GmbH (BEB), an investment accounted for by the equity method, and in part by a consolidated affiliate in Germany. In 2002, cash in the amount of $1,466 million was received from BEB, an equity
company, and included in cash flows from operating activities (see Ruhrgas transaction line on Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, page 53). This cash from BEB was a loan and was part of a restructuring that enabled BEB to transfer its holdings in
Ruhrgas AG provided regulatory approval was received. No income was recorded in 2002.

In 2003, upon receipt of regulatory approvals, the Ruhrgas AG shares held by BEB were transferred, cash was received for the shares held by the consolidated affiliate and a one-time gain of $1,700 million after tax
was recognized in net income. The $2,240 million reduction in 2003 cash flow from operating activities reflects the pretax gains from the transaction. The cash generated from these gains for the BEB portion of the transaction was reported in 2002.
For the shares held by the consolidated affiliate, the cash received was reported in cash flows from investing activities in 2003.

Cash Flow from Investing Activities


Cash used in investing activities totaled $14.9 billion in 2004, $4.1 billion higher than 2003. Spending for property, plant and equipment decreased $0.9 billion. Proceeds from the sales of subsidiaries, investments
and property, plant and equipment in 2004 increased $0.5 billion to $2.8 billion. As discussed in note 16 on page 70, investing activities in 2004 included a pledge by the Corporation of $4.6 billion of collateral consisting of cash and short-term,
high-quality securities to the issuer of a litigation-related appeal bond. This collateral was reported as restricted cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.


Cash used in investing activities totaled $10.8 billion in 2003, $1.0 billion higher than 2002. Spending for property, plant and equipment increased $1.4 billion,
reflecting the Corporation’s active investment program. Proceeds from the sales of subsidiaries, investments and property, plant and equipment in 2003 were $2.3 billion, including $1.2 billion from the sale of an interest in Ruhrgas AG partly
held by a consolidated affiliate.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities


Cash used in financing activities was $18.3 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from 2003,
reflecting a higher level of purchases of ExxonMobil shares. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $1.06 per share from $0.98 per share and totaled $6.9 billion, a payout of 27 percent. Total consolidated short-term and long-term debt
declined $1.2 billion to $8.3 billion at year-end 2004. Shareholders’ equity increased $11.8 billion in 2004 to $101.7 billion, reflecting $25.3 billion of net income partly offset by distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $6.9 billion of
dividends and $9.0 billion of net purchases of shares of ExxonMobil stock. Shareholders’ equity, and net assets and liabilities, also increased $2.2 billion, representing the foreign exchange translation effects of stronger foreign currencies
on ExxonMobil’s operations outside the U.S.

During 2004,
Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 218 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $10.0 billion. These purchases were to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number
of shares outstanding. Shares outstanding were reduced from 6,568 million at the end of 2003 to 6,401 million at the end of 2004. Purchases were made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions. Purchases may be increased, decreased
or discontinued at any time without prior notice.


Cash used in financing activities was $14.8 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from 2002,
reflecting higher levels of debt reductions and purchases of ExxonMobil shares. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $0.98 per share from $0.92 per share and totaled $6.5 billion, a payout of 30 percent. Total consolidated short-term and
long-term debt declined $1.2 billion to $9.5 billion at year-end 2003. Shareholders’ equity increased $15.3 billion in 2003 to $89.9 billion, reflecting $21.5 billion of net income partly offset by $6.5 billion of dividends paid to ExxonMobil
shareholders and $5.4 billion of net

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

purchases of shares of ExxonMobil stock. Shareholders’ equity, and net assets and liabilities, also increased
$4.4 billion, representing the foreign exchange translation effects of stronger foreign currencies on ExxonMobil’s operations outside the U.S.

During 2003, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 163 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $5.9 billion. These purchases
were to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number of shares outstanding. Shares outstanding were reduced from 6,700 million at the end of 2002 to 6,568 million at the end of 2003. Purchases
were made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

Commitments

Set forth below is information about the Corporation’s commitments outstanding at December 31, 2004. It provides data for easy reference from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

This table excludes
commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or minimum price) for which an active, highly liquid market exists and which are expected to be resold shortly after purchase. Examples include long-term, noncancelable upstream
commitments with equity companies to purchase Qatar LNG production and downstream offtake commitments with equity companies and third parties to purchase refinery products at market prices. Inclusion of such amounts would not be meaningful in
assessing liquidity and cash flow, since such market-based purchases will be offset in the same periods by cash received from sales.

Notes:

(1)

Includes capitalized lease obligations of $354 million. Long-term debt amounts exclude the
Corporation’s share of equity company debt, which is included in the calculation of return on average capital employed as shown on page 29.

(2)

The amount due in one year is included in notes and loans payable of $3,280 million (note 6
on page 57).

(3)

The discounted present value of upstream asset retirement obligations, primarily asset
removal costs at the completion of field life.

(4)

The amount by which accumulated benefit obligations (ABOs) exceeded the fair value of fund
assets for certain U.S. and non-U.S. plans at year end (note 17 on page 72). For funded pension plans, this difference was $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004 (U.S. $0.9 billion, non-U.S. $2.6 billion). For unfunded plans, this was the ABO amount of
$5.3 billion (U.S. $1.0 billion, non-U.S. $4.3 billion). The payments by period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2005 and estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years.

(5)

Minimum commitments for operating leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling
equipment, tankers, service stations and other properties.

(6)

Unconditional purchase obligations (UPOs) are those long-term commitments that are
noncancelable and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services. The undiscounted obligations of $4,645 million mainly pertain to pipeline throughput agreements and include
$2,513 million of obligations to equity companies. The present value of the total commitments, excluding imputed interest of $1,386 million, was $3,259 million.

(7)

Take-or-pay obligations are noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services other
than UPOs. The undiscounted obligations of $4,988 million mainly pertain to transportation, refining and natural gas purchases and include $503 million of obligations to equity companies. The present value of the total commitments, excluding imputed
interest of $1,046 million, totaled $3,942 million.

(8)

Firm commitments related to capital projects, shown on an undiscounted basis, totaled
approximately $6.4 billion. These commitments were predominantly associated with upstream projects outside the U.S., of which the largest single commitment outstanding at the end of 2004 was $1.6 billion associated with the development of crude oil
and natural gas resources in Malaysia. The Corporation expects to fund the majority of these commitments through internal cash flow.

Guarantees

The Corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2004, for $3,894 million, primarily relating to guarantees for notes, loans and performance under contracts (note 16 on page 71). This included $1,122 million representing guarantees
of non-U.S. excise taxes and customs duties of other companies, entered into as a normal business practice, under reciprocal arrangements. Also included in this amount were guarantees by consolidated affiliates of $2,428 million, representing
ExxonMobil’s share of obligations of certain equity companies. The above-mentioned guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition,

revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Financial Strength

On December 31, 2004, unused credit lines for short-term financing totaled approximately $5.2 billion (note 6 on page 57).

The table below shows the Corporation’s fixed-charge coverage and
consolidated debt-to-capital ratios. The data demonstrate the Corporation’s creditworthiness. Throughout this period, the Corporation’s long-term debt securities maintained the top credit rating from both Standard and Poor’s (AAA) and
Moody’s (Aaa), a rating it has sustained for 86 years.

(1)

Debt net of cash, excluding restricted cash. The ratio of net debt to capital including
restricted cash is (16.3) percent for 2004.

Management views the Corporation’s financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial ratios and other similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic importance. The Corporation’s sound financial position gives
it the opportunity to access the world’s capital markets in the full range of market conditions, and enables the Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.

In addition to the above commitments, the Corporation makes limited use of
derivative instruments, which are discussed in Risk Management on page 40 and note 13 on page 63.

Litigation and Other Contingencies

As
discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, a number of lawsuits, including class actions, were brought in various courts against Exxon Mobil Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries relating to the accidental release of crude
oil from the tanker Exxon Valdez in 1989. The vast majority of the compensatory claims have been resolved. All of the punitive damage claims were consolidated in the civil trial that began in May 1994.

In that trial, on September 24, 1996, the United States District Court for
the District of Alaska entered a judgment in the amount of $5 billion in punitive damages to a class composed of all persons and entities who asserted claims for punitive damages from the Corporation as a result of the Exxon Valdez grounding.
ExxonMobil appealed the judgment. On November 7, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the punitive damage award as being excessive under the Constitution and remanded the case to the District Court for it to
determine the amount of the punitive damage award consistent with the Ninth Circuit’s holding. The Ninth Circuit upheld the compensatory damage award, which has been paid. On December 6, 2002, the District Court reduced the punitive damage
award from $5 billion to $4 billion. Both the plaintiffs and ExxonMobil appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit panel vacated the District Court’s $4 billion punitive damage award without argument and sent the case back
for the District Court to reconsider in light of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in

Campbell v. State Farm.

On January 28, 2004, the District Court reinstated the punitive damage award at $4.5 billion plus interest. ExxonMobil and the
plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit. The Corporation has posted a $5.4 billion letter of credit. Management believes that the likelihood of the judgment being upheld is remote. While it is reasonably possible that a liability may
have been incurred arising from the Exxon Valdez grounding, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome or to reasonably estimate any such potential liability.

On December 19, 2000, a jury in Montgomery County, Alabama, returned a verdict against the Corporation in a dispute over
royalties in the amount of $88 million in compensatory damages and $3.4 billion in punitive damages in the case of

Exxon Corporation v. State of Alabama, et al.

The verdict was upheld by the trial court on May 4, 2001. On December 20, 2002,
the Alabama Supreme Court vacated the $3.5 billion jury verdict. The case was retried and on November 14, 2003, a state district court jury in Montgomery, Alabama, returned a verdict against Exxon Mobil Corporation. The verdict included $63.5
million in compensatory damages and $11.8 billion in punitive damages. On March 29, 2004, the district court judge reduced the amount of punitive damages to $3.5 billion. ExxonMobil believes the judgment is not justified by the evidence, that any
punitive damage award is not justified by either the facts or the law, and that the amount of the award is grossly excessive and unconstitutional. ExxonMobil has appealed the decision. Management believes that the likelihood of the judgment being
upheld is remote. While it is reasonably possible that a liability may have been incurred by ExxonMobil from this dispute over royalties, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome or to reasonably estimate any such potential liability. On
May 4, 2004, the Corporation posted a $4.5 billion supersedeas bond as required by Alabama law to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal. The Corporation has pledged to the issuer of the bond collateral consisting of cash and short-term,
high-quality securities with an aggregate value of approximately $4.6 billion. This collateral is reported as restricted cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on page 51. Under the terms of the pledge agreement, the Corporation
is entitled to receive the income generated from the cash and securities and to make investment decisions, but is restricted from using the pledged cash and securities for any other purpose until such time the bond is canceled.

On May 22, 2001, a state court jury in New Orleans, Louisiana, returned a
verdict against the Corporation and three other entities in a case brought by a landowner claiming damage to his property. The property had been leased by the landowner to a company that performed pipe cleaning and storage services for customers,
including the Corporation. The jury awarded the plaintiff $56 million in compensatory damages (90 percent to be paid by the Corporation) and $1 billion in punitive damages (all to be paid by the Corporation). The damage related to the presence of
naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) on the site resulting from pipe cleaning operations. The award has been upheld at the trial court. ExxonMobil has appealed the judgment to the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and believes
that the judgment should be set aside or substantially reduced on factual and constitutional grounds. Management believes that the likelihood of the judgment being upheld is remote. While it is reasonably possible that a liability may have been
incurred by ExxonMobil from this

dispute over property damages, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome or to reasonably estimate any such potential liability.

In

Allapattah v. Exxon,

a jury in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Florida determined in January 2001 that a class of all Exxon dealers between March 1983 and August 1994 had been overcharged between 1.03 and 1.4 cents per gallon for gasoline. Exxon sold a total of 39.8 billion gallons of
gasoline to its dealers during this period. The estimated value of the potential claims associated with the 39.8 billion gallons of gasoline is $494 million. Including related interest, the total is approximately $1.3 billion. On June 11, 2003, the
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment and on March 15, 2004, denied a petition for Rehearing En Banc. On October 12, 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of an issue raised by ExxonMobil as to whether the class in the
District Court judgment should include members that individually do not satisfy the $50,000 minimum amount-in-controversy requirement in federal court. Members of the class could file claims through December 1, 2004. Claims representing over 90
percent of the gallons have been filed. In light of the Supreme Court’s decision to grant review of only part of ExxonMobil’s appeal, ExxonMobil took an after-tax charge of $550 million in the third quarter reflecting the estimated
liability, including interest and after considering potential set-offs and defenses, for the claims in excess of $50,000.

Tax issues for 1983 to 1993 remain pending before the U.S. Tax Court. The ultimate resolution of these issues is not expected to have a materially adverse
effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a materially adverse effect upon the Corporation’s
operations or financial condition. There are no events or uncertainties known to management beyond those already included in reported financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating results or financial condition.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES

(1)

Exploration expenses included.

Capital and exploration expenditures in 2004 were $14.9 billion, reflecting the
Corporation’s continued active investment program. Upstream spending was down 2 percent to $ 11.7 billion in 2004, from $ 12.0 billion in 2003, as a result of lower spending on major projects in the North Sea and the U.S. These decreases were
partly offset by higher development drilling in Qatar, the Caspian and Russia. Capital and exploration expenditures are not tracked by the undeveloped and developed proved reserve categories. During the past three years, Upstream capital and
exploration expenditures averaged $11.4 billion, and the Corporation currently expects to spend approximately $12 billion annually through the end of the decade. The majority of these expenditures are on major development projects, which typically
take two to four years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production from those reserves. The percentage of proved developed reserves has remained relatively stable over the past five years at over 60 percent of
total proved reserves, indicating that proved reserves are consistently moved from undeveloped to developed status. Capital investments in the Downstream totaled $2.4 billion in 2004, down $0.4 billion from 2003, primarily reflecting reduced
spending on low-sulfur motor fuels projects in North America. Total Chemical capital expenditures were essentially unchanged from 2003.

TAXES


Income, excise and all other taxes totaled $86.8 billion in 2004, an increase of $ 11.8
billion, or 16 percent, from 2003. Income tax expense, both current and deferred, was $15.9 billion, $4.9 billion higher than 2003, reflecting higher pretax income in 2004. The effective tax rate was 40.3 percent in 2004, compared to 36.4 percent in
2003. Excluding the income tax effects in 2003 of the gain on the Ruhrgas AG share transfer and the settlement of a U.S. tax dispute, the effective rate in 2004 was similar to the prior year. During both periods, the Corporation continued to benefit
from the favorable resolution of other tax-related issues. Excise and all other taxes and duties of $70.9 billion in 2004 increased $6.9 billion from 2003, reflecting higher prices and foreign exchange effects.


Income, excise and all other taxes totaled $75.0 billion in 2003, an increase of $10.7 billion, or 17 percent, from 2002. Income tax
expense, both current and deferred, was $11.0 billion, $4.5 billion higher than 2002, reflecting higher pretax income in 2003. The effective tax rate was 36.4 percent in 2003. Excluding the income tax effects of the 2003 gain on the Ruhrgas AG share
transfer and settlement of a U.S. tax dispute, the effective rate in 2003 was similar to the prior year. During both periods, the Corporation continued to benefit from the favorable resolution of other tax-related issues. Excise and all other taxes
and duties of $64.0 billion in 2003 increased $6.2 billion from 2002, reflecting higher prices and foreign exchange effects.

MERGER EXPENSES AND REORGANIZATION RESERVES

In
association with the merger between Exxon and Mobil, $410 million pretax ($275 million after tax) of costs were recorded as merger-related expenses in 2002. Charges included separation expenses related to workforce reductions (approximately 8,200
employees at year-end 2002), plus implementation and merger closing costs. Merger-related expenses for the period 1999 to 2002 cumulatively totaled approximately $3.2 billion pretax. Reflecting the completion of merger-related activities, merger
expenses were not reported in either 2003 or 2004.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

Asset Retirement Obligations

The methodology of accounting
for asset retirement obligations was modified as of January 1, 2003, per FAS 143. The fair values of asset retirement obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis when they are incurred, which is typically at the time assets are
installed, with an offsetting amount booked as additions to property, plant and equipment ($143 million for 2004). Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the increase in their present value, with this effect included in expenses ($136 million
in 2004). Payments made for asset retirement obligations in 2004 were $201 million, and the ending balance of the obligations recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2004, totaled $3,610 million.

Environmental Costs

Throughout ExxonMobil’s
businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on the air, water and ground. This includes a significant investment in refining technology to manufacture low-sulfur motor fuels and projects to
reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions. ExxonMobil’s 2004 worldwide environmental costs for all such preventative and remediation steps were about $2.9 billion, of which $1.1 billion were capital expenditures and $1.8 billion were
included in expenses. The total cost for such activities is expected to be about $3.0 billion in 2005 (with capital expenditures representing just over 40 percent of the total), and a similar amount is expected for 2006.

The Corporation accrues liabilities for environmental liabilities when it is
probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed. ExxonMobil has accrued liabilities for probable environmental remediation
obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified ExxonMobil as one of the potentially responsible parties. The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these
multiparty sites mitigates ExxonMobil’s actual joint and several liability exposure. At present, no individual site is expected to have losses material to ExxonMobil’s operations, financial condition or liquidity. Provisions made in 2004
for new environmental liabilities were $340 million ($275 million in 2003), included in the $1.8 billion of 2004 expenses noted above, and the balance sheet reflects accumulated liabilities of $643 million as of December 31, 2004, and $528 million
as of December 31, 2003.

Consolidated subsidiaries.

Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to
changing market forces. The impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have been varied, tending at times to be offsetting. In the Upstream, based on the 2004 worldwide production levels, a $1
per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $400 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. Similarly, a $0.10 per kcf change in the worldwide average gas
realization would have approximately a $200 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual
types of crude oil, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide a broad
indicator of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.

In the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference
between what a refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations,
import/export balances and weather.

The global energy markets
can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times associated with many of
our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position. Management views the Corporation’s financial strength, including the AAA and Aaa ratings of its long-term debt securities by Standard and Poor’s and
Moody’s, as a competitive advantage.

In general, segment
results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where such sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated refinery/chemical complexes.
Additionally, intersegment sales are market-related. The products bought and sold between segments can also be acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and transportation capabilities. About 40 percent of the
Corporation’s intersegment sales are crude oil produced by the Upstream and sold to the Downstream. Other intersegment sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related to raw materials, feedstocks and finished products.

Although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or
fall significantly over the short to medium term due to political events, OPEC actions and other factors, industry economics over the long term

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. Accordingly, the Corporation tests the viability of all of its assets based on long-term price
projections. The Corporation’s assessment is that its operations will continue to be successful in a variety of market conditions. This is the outcome of disciplined investment and asset management programs. Investment opportunities are tested
against a variety of market conditions, including low-price scenarios. As a result, investments that would succeed only in highly favorable price environments are screened out of the investment plan.

The Corporation has had an active asset management program in which
underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered for divestment. The asset management program involves a disciplined, regular review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic and
financial objectives. The result has been the creation of a very efficient capital base and has meant that the Corporation has seldom been required to write down the carrying value of assets, even during periods of low commodity prices.

Risk Management

The Corporation’s size, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses mitigate
the Corporation’s risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. The Corporation relies on these operating attributes and strengths to reduce enterprise-wide risk. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of
derivatives to offset exposures arising from existing transactions.

The Corporation does not trade in derivatives nor does it use derivatives with leverage features. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes a policy covering the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative
activity. The Corporation’s derivative activities pose no material credit or market risks to ExxonMobil’s operations, financial condition or liquidity. Interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price exposures arising from
derivative contracts undertaken in accordance with the Corporation’s policies have not been significant.

The fair values of derivatives
outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet are shown in the table above. This is the amount that the Corporation would have paid to or received from third parties if these derivatives had been settled. These derivative fair values were
substantially offset by the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. The gains/losses before tax include the offsetting amounts from the changes in fair value of the items being hedged by the derivatives. The fair value of derivatives
outstanding at year-end 2004 and gain recognized during the year are immaterial in relation to the Corporation’s year-end cash balance of $18.5 billion, total assets of $195.3 billion or net income for the year of $25.3 billion.

Debt-Related Instruments

The Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of its
short-term debt and long-term debt carrying floating interest rates. The Corporation makes limited use of interest rate swap agreements to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in
interest rates affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow or fair value.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Instruments

The Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and
investment transactions. The impacts of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on ExxonMobil’s geographically diverse operations are varied and often offsetting in amount. The Corporation makes limited use of currency exchange
contracts to reduce the risk of adverse foreign currency movements related to certain foreign currency debt obligations. Exposure from market-rate fluctuations related to these contracts is not material. Aggregate foreign exchange transaction gains
and losses included in net income are discussed in note 4 on page 57.

Commodity Instruments

The Corporation makes limited use of
commodity forwards, swaps and futures contracts of short duration to mitigate the risk of unfavorable price movements on certain crude, natural gas and petroleum product purchases and sales. Commodity price exposure related to these contracts is not
material.

Inflation and Other Uncertainties

The general rate of inflation in most major countries of operation has been relatively low
in recent years, and the associated impact on costs has been countered by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity improvements.

The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in
varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property;
cancellation of contract rights; and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.

RECENTLY ISSUED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123R), “Share-based Payment.” FAS 123R requires compensation costs
related to share-based payments to be recognized in the income statement over the vesting period. The amount of the compensation cost will be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the instrument issued. FAS 123R is effective as of July 1,
2005, for all awards granted or modified after that date and for those awards granted prior to that date that have not vested. FAS 123R will have no earnings impact on the Corporation because in 2003 the Corporation adopted a policy of expensing all
share-based payments that is consistent with the provisions of FAS 123R, and all prior year outstanding awards have vested.

EMERGING ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING ISSUES

Accounting for Suspended Well Costs

At its September 2004
meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) discussed Issue No. 04-9, “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs.” Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19 (FAS 19), “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing
Companies,” requires costs of drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If the well has found proved reserves, the capitalized costs are included in wells, equipment and
facilities. If, however, the well has not found proved reserves, the capitalized costs of drilling the well are expensed, net of any salvage value, within one year except under certain specific circumstances. Questions have arisen in practice about
the application of this guidance. The EITF agreed to remove this issue from the EITF agenda and requested that the FASB consider an amendment to FAS 19 to address this issue. On February 4, 2005, the FASB issued a proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP)
that would amend FAS 19 to permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year if (a) the well found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (b) the entity is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Comments on the FSP are due back to the FASB in March 2005, and the guidance in the FSP would be applied prospectively in the first reporting period beginning
after the FSP is finalized.

ExxonMobil continues to carry as
an asset the cost of drilling exploratory wells that find sufficient quantities of reserves to justify their completion as producing wells if the required capital expenditure is made and drilling of additional exploratory wells is under way or
firmly planned for the near future. Once exploration activities demonstrate that sufficient quantities of commercially producible reserves have been discovered, continued capitalization is dependent on project reviews, which take place at least
annually, to ensure that sufficient progress toward ultimate development of the reserves is being achieved. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. ExxonMobil does not believe that this issue will have a material
impact on its financial statements.

The following table shows
the amount of suspended wells on the year-end balance sheet that were greater than one year old with no firm exploratory drilling planned.

Accounting for Purchases and Sales
of Inventory with the Same Counterparty

At its November 2004 meeting, the
EITF began discussion of Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty.” This Issue addresses the question of when it is appropriate to measure purchases and sales of inventory at fair value
and record them in cost of sales and revenues and when they should be recorded as an exchange measured at the book value of the item sold. The EITF did not reach a consensus on this issue, but requested the FASB staff to further explore the
alternative views.

ExxonMobil records certain crude oil,
natural gas, petroleum product, and chemical purchases and sales of inventory entered into contemporaneously with the same counterparty as cost of sales and revenues, measured at fair value as agreed upon by a willing buyer and a willing seller.
These transactions occur under contractual arrangements that establish the agreement terms either jointly, in a single contract, or separately, in individual contracts. This accounting treatment is consistent with long-term, predominant industry
practice based on the Corporation’s knowledge of the industry (although the Corporation understands that some companies in the oil and gas industry may be accounting for these transactions differently as nonmonetary exchanges). Should the EITF
reach a consensus on this Issue requiring these transactions to be recorded as exchanges measured at book value, the Corporation’s accounts “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Crude oil and product purchases” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income would be lower by equal amounts with no impact on net income. All operating segments would be impacted by this change, but the largest effects are in the Downstream. The Corporation has not yet determined the amount
by which “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Crude oil and product purchases” would be lower under this interpretation. A special effort is needed to accumulate this information manually since heretofore it has never been
necessary to identify these monetary transactions separately from other monetary purchases and monetary sales. A best efforts estimate based on this undertaking is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2005. The Corporation does not
believe this estimate will be material, but if it is, the information will be disclosed once it is available together with material changes in trends and uncertainties, if any.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the extracting, refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. The following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and the judgments that are made by the Corporation in the application of those policies.

Oil and Gas Reserves

Evaluations of oil and gas reserves are important to the effective management of upstream assets. They are integral to making investment
decisions about oil and gas properties such as whether development should proceed or enhanced recovery methods should be undertaken. Oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the unit-of-production rates for
depreciation and evaluating for impairment. Oil and gas reserves are divided between proved and unproved reserves. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions; i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Unproved reserves are those with less than
reasonable certainty of recoverability and are classified as either probable or possible. Probable



Index to Financial Statements

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

reserves are reserves that are more likely to be recovered than not, and possible reserves are less likely to be recovered than not.

The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of
reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines. In certain deepwater fields, proved reserves are recorded in a limited
number of cases before flow tests are conducted because of the safety and cost implications of conducting the tests. In those situations, other industry-accepted analyses are used such as information from well logs, a thorough pressure and fluid
sampling program, conventional core data obtained across the entire reservoir interval and nearby analog data. Historically, proved reserves recorded using these methods have been immaterial when compared to the Corporation’s total proved
reserves and have also been validated by subsequent flow tests or actual production levels. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects that have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the
development of the reserves.

The estimation of proved reserves
is controlled by the Corporation through long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals (assisted by a central reserves group
with significant technical experience) culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management. Notably, no employee is compensated based on the level of proved reserve bookings.

Key features of the reserves estimation process include:

•

rigorous peer-reviewed technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance information (such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines), and

•

a requirement that management make significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves prior to booking.

Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be
produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels.

Proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped
reserves. The percentage of proved developed reserves has remained relatively stable over the past five years at over 60 percent of total proved reserves (including both consolidated and equity reserves), indicating that proved reserves are
consistently moved from undeveloped to developed status. Management is not aware of any factors that would significantly change this historical relationship in the next several years. Over time, these undeveloped reserves will be reclassified to the
developed category as new wells are drilled, existing wells are recompleted and/or facilities to collect and deliver the production from existing and future wells are installed. Major development projects typically take two to four years from the
time of recording proved reserves to the start of production from these reserves.

Based on regulatory guidance, the Corporation has reported 2004 reserves on the basis of December 31, 2004, prices and costs (“year-end prices”). Resultant changes from the year-end 2003 reserve estimates,
which were based on long-term projections of oil and gas prices consistent with those used in the Corporation’s investment decision-making process, are shown in the line titled “Year-end price/cost revisions” on pages 83 and 84.

The use of year-end prices for reserves estimation introduces
short-term price volatility into the process since annual adjustments will be required based on prices occurring on a single day. The Corporation believes that this approach is inconsistent with the long-term nature of the upstream business where
production from individual projects often spans multiple decades. The use of prices from a single date is not relevant to the investment decisions made by the Corporation and annual variations in reserves based on such year-end prices are not of
consequence to how the business is actually managed.

Performance-related revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production
data or (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data. This category can also include changes associated with the performance of improved recovery projects and significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility
capacity.

The Corporation uses the “successful
efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred. Costs of
productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the unit-of-production method for each field. The Corporation uses this accounting policy instead of the “full cost” method because it provides a more timely
accounting of the success or failure of the Corporation’s exploration and production activities. If the full cost method were used, all costs would be capitalized and depreciated on a country-by-country basis. The capitalized costs would be
subject to an impairment test by country. The full cost method would tend to delay the expense recognition of unsuccessful projects.

Impact of Oil and Gas Reserves on Depreciation.

The calculation of unit-of-production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation
of upstream assets. It is the ratio of (1) actual volumes produced to (2) total proved developed reserves (those proved reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods) applied to the (3) asset cost. The
volumes produced and asset cost are known and, while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability, they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability. This variability has generally resulted in net upward
revisions of proved reserves in existing fields, as more information becomes available through research and actual production levels. While the upward revisions the Corporation has made in the past are an indicator of variability, they have had a
very small impact on the unit-of-production rates because they have been small compared to the large reserves base.

Impact of Oil and Gas Reserves and Prices on Testing for Impairment.

Proved oil and gas properties held and used by the Corporation are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.



Index to Financial Statements

The Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the
recoverability of carrying amounts. In general, analyses are based on proved reserves. Where probable reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation. An asset would be impaired if
the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.

The Corporation performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of its asset management program. These analyses monitor the performance of
assets against corporate objectives. They also assist the Corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable. In addition to estimating oil and gas reserve volumes in conducting these analyses, it is
also necessary to estimate future oil and gas prices. The impairment evaluation triggers include a significant decrease in current and projected prices or reserve volumes, an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount
originally expected, and historical and current negative operating losses.

In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low oil prices as a triggering event for conducting the impairment tests. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility.
Although prices will occasionally drop precipitously, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining, but this is being offset by
production from new discoveries and field developments. OPEC production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of global economic growth. The relative growth/decline in supply versus demand will
determine industry prices over the long term and these cannot be accurately predicted. Accordingly, any impairment tests that the Corporation performs make use of the Corporation’s long-term price assumptions for the crude oil and natural gas
markets, petroleum products and chemicals. These are the same price assumptions that are used in the Corporation’s annual planning and budgeting processes and are also used for capital investment decisions. The corporate plan is a fundamental
annual management process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and capital objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. Annual volumes are based on individual field
production profiles, which are also updated annually. Prices for natural gas and other products are based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and used for investment evaluation purposes. Cash flow estimates for
impairment testing exclude the use of derivative instruments.

Supplemental information regarding oil and gas results of operations, capitalized costs and reserves can be found on pages 78 to 85. The standardized measure of discounted future cash flows on pages 86 and 87 is based on the year-end 2004
price applied for all future years, as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69 (FAS 69). Future prices used for any impairment tests will vary from the one used in the FAS 69 disclosure, and could be lower or higher for any
given year.

Suspended Exploratory Well Costs

The Corporation carries as an asset the cost of drilling exploratory wells that find
sufficient quantities of reserves to justify their completion as producing wells if the required capital expenditure is made and drilling of additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future. Once exploration activities
demonstrate that sufficient quantities of commercially producible reserves have been discovered, continued capitalization is dependent on project reviews, which take place at least annually, to ensure that sufficient progress toward ultimate
development of the reserves is being achieved. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense.

The following table summarizes the year-end suspended exploratory well balances:

(1)

Includes $68 million for 2004 and $107 million for 2003 for wells older than one year on projects with additional
exploratory drilling in the past 12 months as part of an overall

exploration program to evaluate the property.

The category “Other exploratory activities planned” includes wells
whose continuing commercialization is dependent upon the results of additional seismic work that is either under way or planned. Significant advances in subsurface evaluation technologies have eliminated the need to drill as many exploratory wells
as were required when FAS 19 was adopted in the late 1970s. The use of high-resolution 3-D seismic is a cost-effective technology that can eliminate the need for additional drilling in further defining the resource potential of a property.

The “Projects requiring major capital expenditures”
category represents wells that require large capital projects (the Corporation’s share of development costs typically greater than $50 million, excluding developmental drilling) to develop significant amounts of hydrocarbon

resources discovered by these wells. Sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons have been discovered to justify a project. The timing for progressing these major
projects to development is dependent upon factors such as lengthy negotiations with host governments, distance from markets and existing infrastructure, the effective deployment of existing technology, negotiations with joint venture partners on
development plans and negotiations of long-term sales contracts, particularly if the reserves are in natural gas. These development activities are necessary to confirm whether the wells have found reserves that can be classified as proved, and often
involve interfaces with a wide variety of regulatory bodies at the local, state and/or national level. In many cases required government approvals of proposed development plans have already been obtained, while in other cases development plan
approvals are pending while the Corporation satisfies other regulatory requirements to maintain our rights to the resources.

The “Other projects progressing to commercialization” category includes both discoveries made near existing or already planned infrastructure,
where the timing of development is driven by pipeline or facility capacity limitations, and smaller developments whose project timing is driven by negotiations with governments and co-venturers or the structuring of volume commitments under
long-term sales contracts. In both cases, the existence of sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify a project has been established, and deferral of well costs is a function of development timing.

The Corporation has a long history of converting exploration discoveries into
successful projects and continued to progress activity on the suspended wells in 2004. Timing of proved reserve bookings will vary by individual project but the active, ongoing engagement of the Corporation’s Upstream organization to progress
these opportunities is our standard practice. The following table provides further detail on wells included in the “Projects requiring major capital expenditures” and “Other projects progressing toward commercialization”
categories:

The timing of when proved reserves will be booked on the projects noted above is an estimate and
subject to the uncertainties discussed under the heading “Factors Affecting Future Results” in Item 1 of ExxonMobil’s 2004 Form 10-K. Actual results could differ from estimates due to the factors noted in Item 1.

The following table shows the amount of suspended well costs that were
written off in the past three years after the Corporation made the decision that projects were not commercially viable and proved reserves would not be booked. Total exploration expenses, including nonconsolidated interests, are also shown to
provide context on the suspended well write-offs.

Consolidations

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of those
significant subsidiaries that the Corporation controls. They also include the Corporation’s undivided interests in upstream assets and liabilities. Amounts representing the Corporation’s percentage interest in the underlying net assets of
other significant affiliates that it does not control, but exercises significant influence, are included in “Investments and advances”; the Corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in the consolidated
statement of income caption “Income from equity affiliates.” The accounting for these nonconsolidated companies is referred to as the equity method of accounting.

Majority ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated. However,
certain factors may indicate that a majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These factors occur where the minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract
substantive participating rights. These include the right to approve operating policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans and management compensation and succession plans.

The Corporation consolidates certain affiliates identified as variable-interest entities in which it has less than a
majority ownership, because of guarantees or other arrangements that create majority economic interests in those affiliates that are greater than the Corporation’s voting interests.

Additional disclosures of summary balance sheet and income information for those subsidiaries accounted for under the equity
method of accounting can be found in note 7 on page 58. The Corporation believes this to be important information necessary to a full understanding of the Corporation’s financial statements.

Investments in companies that are partially owned by the Corporation are
integral to the Corporation’s operations. In some cases they serve to balance worldwide risks and in others they provide the only available means of entry into a particular market or area of interest. The other parties who also have an equity
interest in these companies are either independent third parties or host governments that share in the business results according to their percentage ownership. The Corporation does not invest in these companies in order to remove liabilities from
its balance sheet. In fact, the Corporation has long been on record supporting an alternative accounting method that would require each investor to consolidate its percentage share of all assets and liabilities in these partially owned companies
rather than only the percentage in the net equity. This method of accounting for investments in partially owned companies is not permitted by GAAP except where the investments are in the direct ownership of a share in the upstream assets and
liabilities. However, for purposes of calculating return on average capital employed, which is not covered by GAAP standards, the Corporation includes its share of debt of these partially owned companies in the determination of average capital
employed.

Annuity Benefits

The Corporation and its affiliates sponsor approximately 100 defined-benefit
(pension) plans in about 50 countries. The funding arrangement for each plan depends on the prevailing practices and regulations of the countries where the Corporation operates. Note 17, pages 72 to 75, provides details on pension obligations, fund
assets and pension expense.

Some of these plans (primarily
non-U.S.) provide pension benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund. Book reserves are established for these plans because tax conventions and regulatory practices
do not encourage advance funding. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the
term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund
assets.

For funded plans, including many in the U.S., pension
obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements. These plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities, and meet or exceed required funding levels as measured by relevant
actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement dates. In determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes. Contributions
to funded plans totaled $473 million in 2004 (all non-U.S.).

The Corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the
Corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate.

Pension
accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount rate for the benefit obligations, and the long-term rate for future salary increases. All the pension assumptions are
reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. For example, the long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2004
was 9.0 percent. This compares to an actual rate of return over the past decade of 12.5 percent. The Corporation establishes the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each asset class,
taking into account factors such as the expected



Index to Financial Statements

real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the pension fund earnings rate would increase annual pension expense by approximately $85 million before tax.

Under GAAP, differences between actual returns on fund assets versus the
long-term expected return are not recorded in the year that the difference occurs, but rather are amortized in pension expense, along with other actuarial gains and losses, over the expected remaining service life of employees.

Due to the general increase in the market value of pension assets, pension
expense declined from $1,938 million in 2003 (U.S. $1,015 million, non-U.S. $923 million) to $1,630 million in 2004 (U.S. $764 million, non-U.S. $866 million).

Litigation and Other Contingencies

A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits and tax disputes. These are summarized
on pages 37 and 38, with a more extensive discussion included in note 16 on pages 70 and 71.

GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred by the date of the balance sheet and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. These amounts are
not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance or claims against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately. The Corporation revises such accruals in light of new
information.

Significant management judgment is required
related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict. However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past, and actual payments have not been material. In the
Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.

Foreign Currency Translation

The method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the Corporation’s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars is prescribed by GAAP. Under
these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency of these subsidiaries. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects the functional currency after
evaluating this economic environment. Downstream and chemical operations normally use the local currency, except in highly inflationary countries, primarily Latin America, as well as in Singapore, which uses the U.S. dollar, because it predominantly
sells into the U.S. dollar export market. Upstream operations also use the local currency as the functional currency, except where crude and natural gas production is predominantly sold in the export market in U.S. dollars. These operations, which
use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, are in Malaysia, Indonesia, Angola, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and the Middle East.

Factors considered by management when determining the functional currency for a subsidiary include: the currency used for cash flows related to individual
assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to changes in exchange rates; whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw materials, labor, services and supplies; sources of financing; and
significance of intercompany transactions.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management, including the Corporation’s chief executive officer, principal accounting officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the
Corporation’s financial reporting. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Exxon Mobil Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31,2004, was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders
of Exxon Mobil Corporation:

We have completed an integrated audit of Exxon
Mobil Corporation’s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows appearing on
pages 50 to 77 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Exxon Mobil Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004, and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in 2003.



Index to Financial Statements

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation.

The Corporation’s principal business is energy, involving the worldwide exploration, production, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural
gas (Upstream) and the manufacture, transportation and sale of petroleum products (Downstream). The Corporation is also a major worldwide manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals (Chemical), and participates in electric power generation
(Upstream).

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. Certain reclassifications to prior years have been made to conform to the 2004 presentation.

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Principles
of Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of those significant subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly with more than 50 percent of the voting rights held by the Corporation, and for which other shareholders
do not possess the right to participate in significant management decisions. They also include the Corporation’s share of the undivided interest in upstream assets and liabilities. Additionally, the Corporation consolidates certain affiliates
identified as variable-interest entities in which it has less than a majority ownership, because of guarantees or other arrangements that create majority economic interests in those affiliates that are greater than the Corporation’s voting
interests.

Amounts representing the Corporation’s
percentage interest in the underlying net assets of other significant subsidiaries and less-than-majority-owned companies in which a significant equity ownership interest is held, are included in “Investments and advances”; the
Corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in the consolidated statement of income caption “Income from equity affiliates.” The Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation
adjustment for equity method investments is reported in consolidated shareholder’s equity. Evidence of loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such
evidence represents a loss in value of the Corporation’s investment that is other than temporary. Examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses, a negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil
and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment or geographic region. If evidence of an other than temporary loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is recognized. In
the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash flows are used to assess fair value.

Revenue Recognition.

The Corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical products under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. In some cases (e.g., natural gas),
products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic price adjustments. In all cases, revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of
ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenues include the sales portion of certain crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product, and chemical transactions settled in cash where the Corporation contemporaneously negotiates purchases with the same
counterparty under contractual arrangements that establish the agreement terms either jointly, in a single contract, or separately, in individual contracts. The purchases are recorded in crude oil and product purchases. These transactions are
commonly called buy/sell transactions. Together with nonmonetary exchanges as well as independently transacted purchases and sales of crude oil and petroleum products, buy/sell transactions are used to ensure that the right crude oil is at the
appropriate refineries at the right time and that the appropriate products are available to meet consumer demands. This activity is called balancing the supply system.

Each buy/sell transaction is composed of a separate purchase and a separate sale transaction and therefore is accounted for
as any other independently transacted monetary purchase or sale. These monetary transactions are accounted for as cost of sales and revenues, measured at fair value as agreed upon by a willing buyer and a willing seller. They are entered into with
our normal suppliers and customers for substantive business purposes and invoiced for the full fair value of the transaction. Physical delivery is required and each counterparty is legally liable for the full value of the shipment. Each separate
transaction transfers title to the crude oil or petroleum product, and delivery is not conditioned on any other transaction. Each separate transaction is subject to the risk of loss, credit risk, environmental risk, and counterparty nonperformance
risk. These transactions are undertaken by all operating segments, but the majority occur in the Downstream.

Accounting for the sales portion of buy/sell transactions in revenues, measured at fair value, has been the predominant industry practice for decades,
based on the Corporation’s knowledge of the industry. The characteristics of these transactions are indistinguishable from those of any other monetary sales transaction. This accounting practice has recently been addressed in EITF Issue No
03-11, “Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not Held for Trading Purposes as Defined in Issue No. 02-3.” While Issue 03-11 addresses the issue of gross versus net
classification for derivative instruments, it also provides guidance for buy/sell transactions that are not accounted for as derivative instruments. In Issue 03-11, the EITF concluded that the determination of whether contracts not held for trading
purposes should be reported in the income statement on a gross or net basis is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In addition, indicators for gross revenue reporting provided in EITF Issue No. 99-19,
“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent” are consistent with many of the characteristics found in buy/sell transactions. These indicators are useful in providing guidance to assist in the determination of the
appropriate accounting policy. In the judgment of management, the relevant facts and circumstances support accounting for these transactions in revenues, measured at fair value. The Corporation does not believe that these buy/sell transactions fall
under the scope of APB Opinion 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions” because they are monetary transactions.



Index to Financial Statements

Revenues from the production of natural gas properties in which the Corporation has an interest with
other producers are recognized on the basis of the Corporation’s net working interest. Differences between actual production and net working interest volumes are not significant.

Derivative Instruments.

The Corporation makes limited use of derivatives. Derivative instruments are not held for trading purposes
nor do they have leverage features. When the Corporation does enter into derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices. The gains and losses resulting from
the changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in income, except when the instruments are designated as hedging the currency exposure of net investments in foreign subsidiaries, in which case they are recorded in the cumulative foreign
exchange translation account, as part of shareholders’ equity.

The gains and losses on derivative instruments that are designated as fair value hedges (i.e., those hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or the changes in the fair value of a firm commitment) are
offset by the gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the hedged items, which are also recognized in income. Most of these designated hedges are entered into at the same time that the hedged items are transacted; they are fully effective
and in combination with the offsetting hedged items result in no net impact on income. In some situations, the Corporation has chosen not to designate certain immaterial derivatives used for hedging economic exposure as hedges for accounting
purposes due to the excessive administrative effort that would be required to account for these items as hedging transactions. These derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and the gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value are recognized in income. All derivatives activity is immaterial.

Inventories.

Crude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method — LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and
other charges (including depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location. Selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from
inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.

Crude oil, products and merchandise as of year-end 2004 and 2003 consist of the following:

Property, Plant and Equipment.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life
taking obsolescence into consideration. Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.

The Corporation uses the “successful efforts” method to account for
its exploration and production activities. Under this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred. Costs of productive wells and development dry
holes are capitalized and amortized on the unit-of-production method for each field.

The Corporation continues to carry as an asset the cost of drilling exploratory wells that find sufficient quantities of reserves to justify their completion as producing wells if the required capital expenditure is
made and drilling of additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future. Once exploration activities demonstrate that sufficient quantities of commercially producible reserves have been discovered, continued
capitalization is dependent on project reviews, which take place at least annually, to ensure that sufficient progress toward ultimate development of the reserves is being achieved. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to
expense.

Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized
using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves. Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the
estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. The cost of properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized over the average holding period of
the properties of the groups. The valuation allowances are reviewed at least annually. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs, other dry hole costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred.

Unit-of-production depreciation is applied to property, plant and equipment,
including capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs, associated with productive depletable extractive properties, all in the Upstream segment. Unit-of-production rates are based on proved developed reserves, which are oil, gas and other
mineral reserves estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Additional oil and gas to be obtained through the application of improved recovery techniques is included when, or to the extent that, the
requisite commercial-scale facilities have been installed and the required wells have been drilled.

Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales
transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.

Production costs are expensed as incurred. Production involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface and gathering, treating, field processing and field storage of the oil and gas. The production function normally
terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or field production storage tank. Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain the Corporation’s wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas
produced. These costs, sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include such items as labor costs to operate the wells and related equipment; repair and maintenance costs on the wells and equipment; materials, supplies and energy costs required to
operate the wells and related equipment; and administrative expenses related to the production activity.

Gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is no uncertainty about the recovery of costs applicable



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

to any interest retained or where there is no substantial obligation for future performance by the Corporation. Losses on properties sold are recognized when
incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value.

Proved oil and gas properties held and used by the Corporation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.

The Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected
properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. Cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using annually updated corporate plan investment evaluation assumptions for crude oil commodity prices and foreign currency exchange
rates. Annual volumes are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Prices for natural gas and other products are based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and also for investment
evaluation purposes. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude derivative instruments. Impairment analyses are generally based on proved reserves. Where probable reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be
included in the impairment evaluation. Impairments are measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs.

The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for its upstream assets. The fair values of these obligations
are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over
time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in present value. Asset retirement obligations are not recorded for downstream and chemical facilities, because such potential obligations cannot be measured since it is not possible to estimate the
settlement dates.

Liabilities for environmental costs are
recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash expenditures are not discounted.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The “functional currency” for
translating the accounts of the majority of downstream and chemical operations outside the U.S. is the local currency. Local currency is also used for upstream operations that are relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country,
such as in Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway and continental Europe. The U.S. dollar is used for operations in highly inflationary economies, in Singapore, which is predominantly export-oriented, and for some upstream operations, primarily in
Malaysia, Indonesia, Angola, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and the Middle East. For all operations, gains or losses on remeasuring foreign currency transactions into functional currency are included in income.

Stock-Based Awards.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Corporation adopted for all
employee stock-based awards granted after that date, the recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” In accordance with FAS 123, compensation expense
for awards granted on or after January 1, 2003, will be measured by the fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The fair value of awards in the form of restricted stock is the market price of the stock.
The fair value of awards in the form of stock options is estimated using an option-pricing model.

The Corporation has retained its prior method of accounting for stock-based awards granted before January 1, 2003. Under this method, compensation expense
for awards granted in the form of stock options is measured at the intrinsic value of the options (the difference between the market price of stock and the exercise price of the options) on the date of grant. Since these two prices are the same on
the date of grant, no compensation expense was recognized in income for these awards. Additionally, compensation expense for awards granted in the form of restricted stock is based on the price of the stock when it is granted and is recognized over
the vesting period, which is the same method of accounting as under FAS 123.

If the provisions of FAS 123 had been adopted for all prior years, the impact on compensation expense, net income, and net income per share would have been as follows:

The pro forma amounts
that would have been reported if FAS 123 had been in effect for all years are based on the fair value of stock-based awards granted for each of those years and recognized over the vesting period. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the stock-based awards were
in the form of restricted common stock and restricted stock units, and the fair value is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant, which was $51.07, $36.11 and $34.64 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No stock option awards were made
in these years.

2. Discontinued Operations

In 2002, the copper
business in Chile and the coal operations in Colombia were sold. Earnings of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for 2002 as presented in the consolidated statement of income. Income taxes related to discontinued operations were
$41 million in 2002. Included in discontinued operations for 2002 are gains on the dispositions of $400 million, net of tax. The assets sold were primarily property, plant and equipment in the amount of $1.3 billion. Revenues of these operations
were not material. These



Index to Financial Statements

businesses were historically reported in the “All Other” column in the segment disclosures located in note 18 on pages 75 and 76.

3. Merger Expenses and Reorganization Reserves

In association with the merger between Exxon and Mobil, $410 million pretax ($275 million after tax) of costs were recorded as merger-related expenses in 2002. Cumulative charges for the period 1999 to 2002 of $3,189 million included
separation expenses of approximately $1,460 million related to workforce reductions (approximately 8,200 employees at year-end 2002), plus implementation costs and merger closing costs. Reflecting the completion of merger-related activities, merger
expenses were not reported in 2003 or 2004.

The following
table summarizes the activity in the reorganization reserves. The 2002 opening balance represents accruals for provisions taken in prior years.

4. Miscellaneous Financial Information

Research
and development costs totaled $649 million in 2004, $618 million in 2003 and $631 million in 2002.

Net income included aggregate foreign exchange transaction gains of $69 million in 2004 and $11 million in 2003, and losses of $106 million in 2002.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, net income included gains of $227
million, $255 million and $159 million, respectively, attributable to the combined effects of LIFO inventory accumulations and draw-downs. The aggregate replacement cost of inventories was estimated to exceed their LIFO carrying values by $9.8
billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Restricted cash and cash equivalents were $4,604 million at December 31, 2004, attributable to cash and short-term, high-quality securities the Corporation pledged as collateral to the issuer of a $4.5 billion litigation-related bond. The
Corporation posted this bond to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal in the case of

Exxon Corporation v. State of Alabama, et al.

(refer to page 37 and note 16 on page 70 for discussion of this lawsuit). Under the terms of the pledge
agreement, the Corporation is entitled to receive the income generated from the cash and securities and to make investment decisions, but is restricted from using the pledged cash and securities for any other purpose until such time the bond is
canceled.

5. Cash Flow Information

The consolidated
statement of cash flows provides information about changes in cash and cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents.

In 2003, ExxonMobil completed a divestment of interests in shares of Ruhrgas
AG, a German gas transmission company. These shares were held in part by BEB Erdgas und Erdoel GmbH (BEB), an investment accounted for by the equity method, and in part by a consolidated affiliate in Germany. In 2002, cash in the amount of $1,466
million was received from BEB, an equity company, and included in cash flows from operating activities (see Ruhrgas transaction line on Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, page 53). This cash from BEB was a loan and was part of a restructuring
that enabled BEB to transfer its holdings in Ruhrgas AG, provided regulatory approval was received. No income was recorded in 2002.

In 2003, upon receipt of regulatory approvals, the Ruhrgas AG shares held by BEB were transferred, cash was received for the shares held by the
consolidated affiliate and a one-time gain of $1,700 million after tax was recognized in net income. The $2,240 million reduction in 2003 cash flow from operating activities reflects the pretax gains from the transaction. The cash generated from
these gains for the BEB portion of the transaction was reported in 2002. For the shares held by the consolidated affiliate, the cash received was reported in cash flows from investing activities in 2003.

Cash payments for interest were: 2004 – $328 million, 2003 – $429
million and 2002 – $437 million. Cash payments for income taxes were: 2004 – $13,510 million, 2003 – $8,149 million and 2002 – $6,106 million.

6. Additional Working Capital Information

On December 31, 2004, unused credit
lines for short-term financing totaled approximately $5.2 billion. Of this total, $3.3 billion support commercial paper programs under terms negotiated when drawn. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding at December
31, 2004, and 2003 was 3.5 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.

7. Equity Company Information

The summarized
financial information below includes amounts related to certain less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant management decisions (see note 1 on page
54). These companies are primarily engaged in crude production, natural gas marketing and refining operations in North America; natural gas production, natural gas distribution and downstream operations in Europe; crude production in Kazakhstan and
Abu Dhabi; and liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations in Qatar. Also included are several power generation, petrochemical/lubes manufacturing and chemical ventures. The Corporation’s ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in
corporate joint ventures as well as interests in partnerships. The share of total revenues in the table below representing sales to ExxonMobil consolidated companies was 22 percent, 18 percent and 19 percent in the years 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

A list of significant equity companies
as of December 31, 2004, together with the Corporation’s percentage ownership interest, is detailed below:

8. Investments and Advances

9. Property, Plant and Equipment and Asset Retirement Obligations

In the Upstream segment, depreciation
is on a unit-of-production basis, so depreciable life will vary by field. In the Downstream segment, investments in refinery and lubes basestock manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life and
service station buildings and fixed improvements over a 20-year life. In the Chemical segment, investments in process equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 20-year life.

Accumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $133,783 million at the end of
2004 and $124,350 million at the end of 2003. Interest capitalized in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $500 million, $490 million and $426 million, respectively.

The Corporation carries as an asset the cost of drilling exploratory wells that find sufficient quantities of reserves to justify their completion as
producing wells if the required capital expenditure is made and drilling of additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned or the near future. Once exploration activities demonstrate that sufficient quantities of commercially producible
reserves have been discovered, continued capitalization is dependent on project reviews, which take place at least annually, to ensure that sufficient progress toward ultimate development of the reserves is being achieved. Exploratory well costs not
meeting these criteria are charged to expense.

The following table provides
the year-end balances and movements for suspended exploratory well costs:

Asset Retirement Obligations (AROs)

As of January 1, 2003, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (FAS 143), “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” The primary impact of FAS 143 was to change the method for accruing for upstream site restoration costs. Asset
retirement obligations are not recorded for downstream and chemical facilities because such potential obligations cannot be measured since it is not possible to estimate the settlement dates.

Upstream costs were previously accrued ratably over the productive lives of
the assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19 (FAS 19), “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies.” Under FAS 143, the fair values of asset retirement obligations are recorded
as liabilities on a discounted basis when they are incurred, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. Amounts recorded for the related assets will be increased by the amount of these obligations. Over time, the liabilities will be
accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs will be depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.

The cumulative adjustment for the change in accounting principle reported in the first quarter of 2003 was after-tax income of $550 million (net of $442
million of income tax effects, including ExxonMobil’s share of related equity company income taxes of $51 million), or $0.08 per common share. The effect of this accounting change on the 2003 balance sheet was a $0.3 billion increase to
property, plant and equipment, a $0.6 billion reduction to the accrued liability and a $0.4 billion increase in deferred income tax liabilities

The following table summarizes the activity in the liability for asset retirement obligations:



Index to Financial Statements

10. Leased Facilities

At December 31, 2004, the
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries held noncancelable operating charters and leases covering drilling equipment, tankers, service stations and other properties with minimum lease commitments as indicated in the table.

Net rental expenditures for 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $2,491 million,
$2,298 million and $2,322 million, respectively, after being reduced by related rental income of $136 million, $141 million and $140 million, respectively. Minimum rental expenditures totaled $2,501 million in 2004, $2,319 million in 2003 and $2,378
million in 2002.

11. Employee Stock Ownership Plans

In 1989, the
Exxon and Mobil employee stock ownership plan trusts borrowed $1,000 million and $800 million, respectively, to finance the purchase of shares of Exxon and Mobil stock. The trusts were merged in late 1999 to create the ExxonMobil leveraged employee
stock ownership trust (ExxonMobil ESOP). The ExxonMobil ESOP is a constituent part of the ExxonMobil Savings Plan, which, effective February 8, 2002, is an employee stock ownership plan in its entirety.

Employees eligible to participate in the ExxonMobil Savings Plan may elect to
participate in the ExxonMobil ESOP. Corporate contributions to the plan and dividends were used to make principal and interest payments on the ExxonMobil ESOP notes ($65 million outstanding as of December 31, 2002, which was fully paid in 2003). As
corporate contributions and dividends were credited, common shares were allocated to participants’ plan accounts. The Corporation’s contribution to the ExxonMobil ESOP, representing the amount by which debt service exceeded dividends on
shares held by the ExxonMobil ESOP, was $59 million and $86 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. No contributions were made in 2004.

Accounting for the plans has followed the principles that were in effect for the respective plans when they were established. During the time that the
guaranteed ESOP borrowing was outstanding, the borrowing was included in ExxonMobil’s debt. The future compensation to be earned by employees was classified in shareholders’ equity. No guaranteed debt was outstanding at year-end 2004, and
there was no future compensation classified in shareholders’ equity as all compensation was earned. Expense, net of the dividends used for debt service, was recognized as the debt was repaid and shares were earned by employees. The amount of
compensation expense related to the plans and recorded by the Corporation was $32 million in 2003 and $122 million in 2002. No expense was incurred in 2004.

12. Capital

The authorized common stock of the
Corporation is 9 billion shares without par value. The table below summarizes the earnings per share calculations:



Index to Financial Statements

13. Financial Instruments and Derivatives

The
fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. Long-term debt is the only category of financial instruments whose fair value differs materially from the recorded
book value. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, including capitalized lease obligations, at December 31, 2004, and 2003, was $5.9 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, as compared to recorded book values of $5.0 billion and $4.8
billion.

The Corporation’s size, geographic diversity and
the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses mitigate the Corporation’s risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. The Corporation relies on these operating attributes and strengths
to reduce enterprise-wide risk. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of derivatives to offset exposures arising from existing transactions.

The Corporation does not trade in derivatives nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that
includes a policy covering the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity. The Corporation’s derivative activities pose no material credit or market risks to ExxonMobil’s operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price exposures arising from derivative contracts undertaken in accordance with the Corporation’s policies have not been significant.

The fair value of derivatives outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet
was a net receivable of $6 million and a net payable of $17 million at year-end 2004 and 2003, respectively. This is the amount that the Corporation would have paid to or received from third parties if these derivatives had been settled. These
derivative fair values were substantially offset by the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. The Corporation recognized a gain of $38 million, a gain of $4 million and a loss of $35 million related to derivative activity during
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The gains/losses included the offsetting amounts from the changes in fair value of the items being hedged by the derivatives.

14. Long-Term Debt

At December 31, 2004,
long-term debt consisted of $4,671 million due in U.S. dollars and $342 million representing the U.S. dollar equivalent at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. These amounts exclude that portion of long-term debt,
totaling $608 million, which matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. The amounts of long-term debt maturing, together with sinking fund payments required, in each of the four years after December 31, 2005, in millions of
dollars, are: 2006 – $120, 2007 – $127, 2008 – $284 and 2009 – $135. Certain of the borrowings described may from time to time be assigned to other ExxonMobil affiliates. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation’s unused
long-term credit lines were not material.

borrowings at year-end 2004 and 2003 were as shown in the adjacent table:

15. Incentive Program

The 2003 Incentive
Program provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and other forms of award. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned. The maximum
number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited or expire, or are settled in cash, do not count against this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified
term. New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the Board terminates the plan early. Outstanding awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Shares available for
granting under the 2003 Incentive Program were 199,300 thousand at the end of 2004.

As under earlier programs, options and SARs may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. Most of the options and SARs normally first
become exercisable one year following the date of grant. All remaining stock options and SARs outstanding were granted prior to 2002.

Long-term incentive awards totaling 11,374 thousand, 10,381 thousand and 11,072 thousand shares of restricted (nonvested) common stock and restricted
(nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These shares with a value of $554 million, $357 million and $361 million at the grant date in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, will be issued to employees from
treasury stock. The price of the stock on the date of grant was $51.07, $36.11 and $34.64 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The total compensation expense of $581 million for 2004 grants (including units with a value of $27 million that will be
settled in cash), of $375 million for 2003 grants (including units with a value of $18 million that will be settled in cash) and of $384 million for 2002 grants (including units with a value of $23 million that will be settled in cash) will be
recognized over the vesting period. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares may not be sold or
transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven years. A small number of awards
granted to certain employees have longer vesting periods.

16. Litigation and Other Contingencies

Litigation

A variety of claims have been made against
ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits and tax disputes. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or
remote. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against
ExxonMobil will have a materially adverse effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

A number of lawsuits, including class actions, were brought in various courts against Exxon Mobil Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries relating to
the accidental release of crude oil from the tanker Exxon Valdez in 1989. The vast majority of the compensatory claims have been resolved. All of the punitive damage claims were consolidated in the civil trial that began in May 1994.

In that trial, on September 24, 1996, the United States District Court for
the District of Alaska entered a judgment in the amount of $5 billion in punitive damages to a class composed of all persons and entities who asserted claims for punitive damages from the Corporation as a result of the Exxon Valdez grounding.
ExxonMobil appealed the judgment. On November 7, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the punitive damage award as being excessive under the Constitution and remanded the case to the District Court for it to
determine the amount of the punitive damage award consistent with the Ninth Circuit’s holding. The Ninth Circuit upheld the compensatory damage award, which has been paid. On December 6, 2002, the District Court reduced the punitive damage
award from $5 billion to $4 billion. Both the plaintiffs and ExxonMobil appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit panel vacated the District Court’s $4 billion punitive damage award without argument and sent the case back
for the District Court to reconsider in light of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in

Campbell v. State Farm.

On January 28, 2004, the District Court reinstated the punitive damage award at $4.5 billion plus interest. ExxonMobil and the
plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit. The Corporation has posted a $5.4 billion letter of credit.

On January 29, 1997, a settlement agreement was concluded resolving all remaining matters between the Corporation and various insurers arising from the
Valdez accident. Under terms of this settlement, ExxonMobil received $480 million. Final income statement recognition of this settlement continues to be deferred in view of uncertainty regarding the ultimate cost to the Corporation of the Valdez
accident. Management believes that the likelihood of the judgment being upheld is remote. While it is reasonably possible that a liability may have been incurred arising from the Exxon Valdez grounding, it is not possible to predict the ultimate
outcome or to reasonably estimate any such potential liability.

On December 19, 2000, a jury in the 15th Judicial Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, returned a verdict against the Corporation in a dispute over royalties in the amount of $88 million in compensatory damages and $3.4 billion in
punitive damages in the case of

Exxon Corporation v. State of Alabama, et al.

The verdict was upheld by the trial court on May 4, 2001. On December 20, 2002, the Alabama Supreme Court vacated the $3.5 billion jury verdict. The case was
retried and on November 14, 2003, a state district court jury in Montgomery, Alabama, returned a verdict against Exxon Mobil Corporation. The verdict included $63.5 million in compensatory damages and $11.8 billion in punitive damages. On March 29,
2004, the district court judge reduced the amount of punitive damages to $3.5 billion. ExxonMobil believes the judgment is not justified by the evidence, that any punitive damage award is not justified by either the facts or the law, and that the
amount of the award is grossly excessive and unconstitutional. ExxonMobil has appealed the decision. Management believes that the likelihood of the judgment being upheld is remote. While it is reasonably possible that a liability may have been
incurred by ExxonMobil from this dispute over royalties, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome or to reasonably estimate any such potential liability. On May 4, 2004, the Corporation posted a $4.5 billion supersedeas bond as required by
Alabama law to stay execution of the judgment pending appeal. The Corporation has pledged to the issuer of the bond collateral consisting of cash and short-term, high-quality securities with an aggregate value of approximately $4.6 billion. This
collateral is reported as restricted cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on page 51. Under the terms of the pledge agreement, the Corporation is entitled to receive the income generated from the cash and securities and to
make investment decisions, but is restricted from using the pledged cash and securities for any other purpose until such time the bond is canceled.

On May 22, 2001, a state court jury in New Orleans, Louisiana, returned a verdict against the Corporation and three other entities in a case brought by a
landowner claiming damage to his property. The property had been leased by the landowner to a company that performed pipe cleaning and storage services for customers, including the Corporation. The jury awarded the plaintiff $56 million in
compensatory damages (90 percent to be paid by the Corporation) and $1 billion in punitive damages (all to be paid by the Corporation). The damage related to the presence of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) on the site resulting from
pipe cleaning operations. The award has been upheld at the trial court. ExxonMobil has appealed the judgment to the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and believes that the judgment should be set aside or substantially reduced on factual and
constitutional grounds. Management believes that the likelihood of the judgment being upheld is remote. While it is reasonably possible that a liability may have been incurred by ExxonMobil from this dispute over property damages, it is not possible
to predict the ultimate outcome or to reasonably estimate any such potential liability.

In

Allapattah v. Exxon,

a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida determined in January 2001 that a class of all Exxon dealers between March 1983 and August 1994 had been
overcharged between 1.03 and 1.4 cents per gallon for gasoline. Exxon



Index to Financial Statements

sold a total of 39.8 billion gallons of gasoline to its dealers during this period. The estimated value of the potential claims associated with the 39.8
billion gallons of gasoline is $494 million. Including related interest, the total is approximately $1.3 billion. On June 11, 2003, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment and on March 15, 2004, denied a petition for Rehearing En
Banc. On October 12, 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of an issue raised by ExxonMobil as to whether the class in the District Court judgment should include members that individually do not satisfy the $50,000 minimum
amount-in-controversy requirement in federal court. Members of the class could file claims through December 1, 2004. Claims representing over 90 percent of the gallons have been filed. In light of the Supreme Court’s decision to grant review of
only part of ExxonMobil’s appeal, ExxonMobil took an after-tax charge of $550 million in the third quarter reflecting the estimated liability, including interest and after considering potential set-offs and defenses, for the claims in excess of
$50,000.

Tax issues for 1983 to 1993 remain pending before the
U.S. Tax Court. The ultimate resolution of these issues is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

Other Contingencies

The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2004, for
$3,894 million, primarily relating to guarantees for notes, loans and performance under contracts. This included $1,122 million representing guarantees of non-U.S. excise taxes and customs duties of other companies, entered into as a normal business
practice, under reciprocal arrangements. Also included in this amount were guarantees by consolidated affiliates of $2,428 million, representing ExxonMobil’s share of obligations of certain equity companies.

Additionally, the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries have numerous
long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. Unconditional purchase
obligations, as defined by accounting standards, are those long-term commitments that are non-cancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the
contracted goods or services.

(1)

Undiscounted obligations of $4,645 million mainly pertain to pipeline throughput
agreements and include $2,513 million of obligations to equity companies. The present value of these commitments, excluding imputed interest of $1,386 million, totaled $3,259 million.

The operations and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates throughout
the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations, such as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and exports; price controls;
tax increases and retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property; cancellation of contract rights; and environmental regulations. Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the Corporation vary greatly from country to
country and are not predictable.

17. Annuity Benefits and Other Postretirement Benefits

Costs for defined contribution plans
were $245 million, $253 million and $191 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The benefit obligations and plan assets associated with the Corporation’s principal benefit plans are measured on December 31.

(1)

The term benefit obligation means “projected
benefit obligation” as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 (FAS 87), “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” for annuity benefits and “accumulated postretirement benefit obligation” as defined by
FAS 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions,” for other postretirement benefits.

The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 6 percent for 2005 that declines to 2.5 percent by 2011. The
2003 actuarial loss for other postretirement benefits reflects a change in the health care cost trend rate assumption at year-end 2003. A one-percentage-point increase in the health care cost trend rate would increase service and interest cost by
$33 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by $373 million. A one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rate would decrease service and interest cost by $27 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by $316
million.



Index to Financial Statements

The Corporation offers a Medicare supplement plan to Medicare-eligible retirees that provides
prescription drug benefits. On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”). The Act provides a federal subsidy to employers
sponsoring retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The Corporation believes that its Medicare supplement plan is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D but that
it is not a significant event for the plan. Accordingly, the Corporation recognized the effects of the Act at the December 31, 2004, measurement date.

The data on the
preceding page conform with current accounting standards that specify use of a discount rate at which postretirement liabilities could be effectively settled. The discount rate for calculating year-end postretirement liabilities is based on the
year-end rate of interest on a portfolio of high-quality bonds. The return on the annuity fund’s actual portfolio of assets has historically been higher than bonds as the majority of pension assets are invested in equities, as illustrated in
the table below, which shows asset allocation. The U.S. long-term expected rate of return of 9.0 percent used in 2004 compares to an actual rate of return for the U.S. annuity fund over the past decade of 12.5 percent. The Corporation establishes
the long-term expected rate of return for each plan by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single,
long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.

The Corporation’s
investment strategy for benefit plan assets reflects a long-term view, a careful assessment of the risks inherent in various asset classes and broad diversification to reduce the risk of the portfolio. The Corporation primarily invests in funds that
follow an index-based strategy to achieve its objectives of diversifying risk while minimizing costs. The funds hold ExxonMobil stock only to the extent necessary to replicate the relevant equity index. Asset-liability studies, or simulations of the
interaction of cash flows associated with both assets and liabilities, are periodically used to establish the preferred target asset allocation. The target asset allocation for equity securities of 75 percent for the U.S. benefit plans and 67
percent for non-U.S. plans reflects the long-term nature of the liability. The balance of the funds is largely targeted to debt securities.



Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The funding levels of all qualified plans are in compliance with standards set by applicable law or regulation. Certain
smaller U.S. plans and a number of non-U.S. plans are not funded because local tax conventions and regulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. All defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status of the
underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate.

A summary comparing the total plan assets to the total projected benefit obligation is shown in the table below:

18. Disclosures about Segments and Related Information

The Upstream, Downstream and Chemical functions best define the operating segments of the business that are reported separately. The factors used to identify these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are
undertaken by each segment. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products, and the Chemical segment is
organized and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. These segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical industries.

These functions have been defined as the operating segments of the Corporation because they are the segments (a) that engage in business activities from
which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its
performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.

Earnings include special items and transfers are at estimated market prices. Consistent with a change in internal organization in 2002, earnings from the electric power business, previously reported in the Other
segment, are now shown within non-U.S. Upstream. Earnings from the divested coal and minerals businesses are shown as discontinued operations and are included within the Other segment. In addition to discontinued operations, the Other segment
includes corporate and financing activities and merger-related expenses. The interest revenue amount relates to interest earned on cash deposits and marketable securities. Interest expense includes nondebt-related interest expense of $529 million,
$106 million and $207 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 reflects the interest component of the Allapattah lawsuit provision. U.S. Downstream after-tax earnings in 2004 include a special charge of $550 million
relating to the Allapattah lawsuit provision. Non-U.S. Upstream after-tax earnings in 2003 include $1,700 million from a gain on the transfer of shares in Ruhrgas AG, a German gas transmission company. All Other after-tax earnings in 2003 include
$2,230 million relating to the positive settlement of a long-running U.S. tax dispute. All Other after-tax earnings in 2003 also include a $550 million positive impact for the required adoption of FAS 143 relating to accounting for asset retirement
obligations. Non-U.S. Upstream after-tax earnings in 2002 include a special charge of $215 million reflecting the impact on deferred taxes from the 10 percent supplementary tax enacted in the United Kingdom in 2002.

Average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own
production as the divisor. Average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor. The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table on
page 83 of this report. The volumes for natural gas used for this calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and thus are different than those shown in the reserves table on page 84 of this report due to volumes
consumed or flared. The volumes of natural gas were converted to oil-equivalent barrels based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel.

The amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated subsidiaries are $4,769 million
less at year-end 2004 and $3,961 million less at year-end 2003 than the amounts reported as investments in property, plant and equipment for the Upstream in note 9, page 59. This is due to the exclusion from capitalized costs of certain
transportation and research assets and assets relating to the tar sands and LNG operations, all as required in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19. Part of the increase in net capitalized costs at year-end 2003 reflected the adoption
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143.

Oil and Gas Reserves

(unaudited)

The following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2002, 2003 and 2004.

The definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X, paragraphs (2) through (2)iii, (3) and (4).

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in
existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not on escalations based upon future conditions. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.
In certain deepwater fields, proved reserves are recorded in a limited number of cases before flow tests are conducted because of the safety and cost implications of conducting the tests. In those situations, other industry-accepted analyses are
used. Historically, proved reserves recorded using these methods have been immaterial when compared to the Corporation’s total proved reserves and have also been validated by subsequent flow tests or actual production levels.

Based on regulatory guidance, the Corporation has reported 2004 reserves on
the basis of December 31, 2004, prices and costs (“year-end prices”).

The use of year-end prices for reserves estimation introduces short-term price volatility into the process since annual adjustments will be required based on prices occurring on a single day. The Corporation believes
that this approach is inconsistent with the long-term nature of the upstream business where production from individual projects often spans multiple decades. The use of prices from a single date is not relevant to the investment decisions made by
the Corporation and annual variations in reserves based on such year-end prices are not of consequence to how the business is actually managed.

The impact of year-end prices on reserve estimation is most graphically shown at the Cold Lake field (heavy oil-bitumen steam project) in Canada where
proved reserves were reduced by approximately 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels as a result of employing December 31 prices, which were unusually low for bitumen. However, bitumen prices in western Canada increased substantially after December 31
and resulted in the rebooking of approximately 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels at the Cold Lake field in 2005.

Performance-related revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the
evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data or (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data. This category can also include changes associated with the performance of improved recovery projects and
significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.

Proved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate’s participation in proved reserves and ExxonMobil’s ownership percentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties
and quantities due others. Gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and
natural gas liquids.

In the reserves tables on pages 83 to 85,
consolidated reserves and equity reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.

Reserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as
defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The percentage of conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2004 that were associated with production sharing contract
arrangements was 17 percent of liquids, 9 percent of natural gas and 13 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (gas converted to oil-equivalent at 6 billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels).

Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing
equipment and operating methods. Undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered as a result of future investments to drill new wells, to recomplete existing wells and/or to install facilities to collect and deliver the
production from existing and future wells.

Crude oil and
natural gas liquids and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of gas delivered for sale by the producing function as
reported on page 89 due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN TAR SANDS PROVEN RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE

In addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, ExxonMobil has
significant interests in proven tar sands reserves in Canada associated with the Syncrude project. For internal management purposes, ExxonMobil views these reserves and their development as an integral part of total upstream operations. However, for
financial reporting purposes, these reserves are required to be reported separately from the oil and gas reserves.

The tar sands reserves are not considered in the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which is
found on page 86.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows

As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows is computed by applying year-end prices, costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10 percent to net proved reserves. The standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and
rehabilitation obligations. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties
or of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. The standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including year-end prices, which represent a single point in time and therefore may cause significant variability
in cash flows from year to year as prices change.

Includes discounted future net cash flows attributable to Imperial Oil Limited of $5,210 million in 2002, $3,667 million in
2003 and $2,773 million in 2004, in which there is a 30.4 percent minority interest.
