PART I

ITEM 1.
      BUSINESS

Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State
of New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil operate
or market products in the United States and most other countries of the world.
Their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production
of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products and
transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.
ExxonMobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals,
including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a
wide variety of specialty products. ExxonMobil also has interests in electric
power generation facilities. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive
research programs in support of these businesses.

Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and
hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include

ExxonMobil

,

Exxon

,

Esso, Mobil

or

XTO

. For convenience and simplicity, in this
report the terms

ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil

and

XTO

, as well
as terms like

Corporation

,

Company

,

our

,

we

and

its

,
are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups
of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question.

Throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing
measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air,
water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining
infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels as well as projects to
monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, and greenhouse gas emissions and
expenditures for asset retirement obligations.  Using definitions and
guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2013
worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation
steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $6.0 billion,
of which $3.5 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in
capital expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to remain
in this range in 2014 and 2015 (with capital expenditures approximately 45 percent
of the total).

The energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other
industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial
and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale
or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate
for such purposes.

Operating data and industry segment information for
the Corporation are contained in the Financial Section of this report under the
following: “Quarterly Information”, “Note 18: Disclosures about Segments
and Related Information” and “Operating Summary”. Information on oil and gas
reserves is contained in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental
Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of
the Financial Section of this report.

ExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to the
development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research
programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business
segments. Information on Company-sponsored research and development spending is
contained in “Note 3: Miscellaneous Financial Information” of the
Financial Section of this report. ExxonMobil held approximately 11 thousand
active patents worldwide at the end of 2013. For technology licensed to third
parties, revenues totaled approximately $195 million in 2013. Although
technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of
our Company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any
individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession.

The number of regular employees was 75.0 thousand, 76.9
thousand and 82.1 thousand at years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional,
technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the
Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and programs.
Regular employees do not include employees of the company-operated retail sites
(CORS). The number of CORS employees was 9.8 thousand, 11.1 thousand and 17.0
thousand at years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Information concerning the source and availability of
raw materials used in the Corporation’s business, the extent of seasonality in
the business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of
contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign
operations may be found in “Item 1A–Risk Factors” and “Item 2–Properties” in
this report.

ExxonMobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com. Our
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made

well as the charters of the audit, compensation and nominating committees of
the Board of Directors. Information on our website is not incorporated into
this report.


ITEM 1A.       RISK
FACTORS

ExxonMobil’s financial and operating
results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and
petrochemical businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within the
Company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and
operating results or our financial condition. These risk factors include:

Supply and Demand

The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are
fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and petrochemical
prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemical
and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional and global
events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity.

Economic conditions.

The demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with
general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of
low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on
our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world
or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of
civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate
fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals.
Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to
credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of
fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other
events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and
institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of
our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to
fulfill their commitments to ExxonMobil.

Other demand-related factors.

Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas
and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological
improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the
demand for energy associated with heating and cooling; increased
competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not
been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies
or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel
choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.

Other supply-related factors.

Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a
number of factors affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the
development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance
recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent
such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly,
increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to
reduce margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical
supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies,
such as adherence by member countries to OPEC production quotas and the
occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in
competitors’ operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels
that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative
costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to
manufacture petrochemicals.

Other market factors.

ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to
potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation,
currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. We
generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures.

Government and Political Factors

ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by
political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.

Access limitations.

A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or
may place resources off-limits from development altogether. Restrictions on
foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high
commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside
sources of private capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export
of certain products based on point of origin.

Restrictions on doing business.

As a U.S. company, ExxonMobil is subject to laws
prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business in certain countries, or
restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. Such restrictions may
provide a competitive advantage to our non-U.S. competitors unless their own
home countries impose comparable restrictions.

Lack of legal certainty.

Some countries in which we do business lack
well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted clear regulatory
frameworks for oil and gas development. Lack of legal certainty exposes our
operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government
officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. In
some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate
disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still
depend on the local legal system to enforce an award.


Regulatory and litigation risks.

Even in countries with well-developed legal
systems where ExxonMobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law
(including changes that result from international treaties and accords) that
could adversely affect our results, such as:

Legal remedies available to compensate us for
expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.

We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of
litigation, especially in countries such as the United States in which very
large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur, or by government
enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or
regulations.

Security concerns.

Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be
disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local
security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for
security or to shut down operations for a period of time.

Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions.

Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a
number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of,
regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include
adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting,
increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable
energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen
project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as
shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural
gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our
compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.

Government sponsorship of alternative energy.

Many governments are providing tax advantages and
other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use
of specific fuels or technologies. Governments are also promoting research into
new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative
energy sources. We are conducting our own research efforts into alternative
energy, such as through sponsorship of the Global Climate and Energy Project at
Stanford University and research into liquid products from algae and biomass
that can be further converted to transportation fuels. Our future results may
depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to
adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy
products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. See “Management
Effectiveness” below.

Management Effectiveness

In addition to external economic and political
factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage
successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. The
extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to
competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the
management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control.

Exploration and development program.

Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas
production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts.
Among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the
most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to
bring discovered resources on line on schedule and within budget.

Project management.

The success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical
businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital intensive projects. These
projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to
maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can affect the performance of major
projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers,
partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize
reservoir performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through
long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage
changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party
equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the
extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties
that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and
influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does not
perform that role.


The term “project” as used
in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not
necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

Operational efficiency.

An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive
performance, especially given the commodity-based nature of many of our
businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to
manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. This
requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost
control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio,
and the recruitment, development and retention of high caliber employees.

Research and development.

To maintain our competitive position, especially in
light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous
efficiency improvement, ExxonMobil’s research and development organizations
must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy
environment.

Safety, business controls, and environmental risk
management.

Our results depend on
management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and
petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities and to
minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous management systems
and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other
adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a
combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing
upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and
surveillance. Similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies
and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in
response to government requirements but also to address community priorities.
We also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a
controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework.
Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our
management systems and controls do not function as intended. The ability to
insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable
insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.

Business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity
breaches. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not
to be sufficient, ExxonMobil could be adversely affected such as by having its
business systems compromised, its proprietary information altered, lost or
stolen, or its business operations disrupted.

Preparedness.

Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters,
human error, and similar events. For example, hurricanes may damage our
offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in
vulnerable areas. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events
depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness
and response planning, as well as business continuity planning.

Projections, estimates and descriptions of
ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in Items 1, 1A, 2, 7
and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future results,
including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs
and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the
factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

1. Disclosure of Reserves

A. Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at
Year-End 2013

The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved
reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated
subsidiaries and equity companies. The Corporation has reported proved reserves
on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month
during the last 12-month period. Gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at
six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. No major discovery or other
favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2013, that would
cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.

In the preceding reserves information, consolidated
subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the
Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves
as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.

The Corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook,
based on projects coming on stream as anticipated, is for production capacity
to grow over the period 2014-2018. However, actual volumes will vary from year
to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages,
reservoir performance, regulatory changes, asset sales, weather events, price
effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in Item
1A—Risk Factors of this report.

The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on
the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on
rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed
analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir
pressure declines. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves
for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management
made toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably
certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered
can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development
projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes
in projections of long-term oil and gas price levels.

B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved
Reserves Additions in 2013

Additions to ExxonMobil’s proved reserves in 2013 were
based on estimates generated through the integration of available and
appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing
well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield
repeatable and consistent results.

Data used in these integrated assessments included
information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well
logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure
information, production test data, and surveillance and performance
information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained
through indirect measurements including high-quality 2-D and 3-D seismic data,
calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret
the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary
reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data
analysis packages.

In some circumstances, where appropriate analog
reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to
increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.

C. Qualifications of Reserves
Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves

ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves group that provides
technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization. Primary
responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation
process for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and
regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting
of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company
reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas
liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil and natural gas. In addition, the group
provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and
reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the
Global Reserves group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir
engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in Engineering.  He is an
active member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and previously served
on the SPE Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. The group is managed by and staffed
with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical
experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification
and categorization of reserves under the SEC guidelines. This group includes
individuals who hold advanced degrees in either Engineering or Geology. Several
members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of
expertise, and members have served on the SPE Oil and Gas Reserves Committee.

The Global Reserves group maintains a central database
containing the official company reserves estimates. Appropriate controls,
including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place
to ensure data integrity within this central database.  An annual review of the
system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the
reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well
and field performance and a rigorous peer review. No changes may be made to the
reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new
initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have
been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the
operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed
certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level
of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made
in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves group for all proved
reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all
changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final
endorsement.


2. Proved
Undeveloped Reserves

At year-end 2013, approximately 8.5 billion
oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified
as proved undeveloped. This represents 34 percent of the 25.2 GOEB reported in
proved reserves. This compares to the 9.9 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves
reported at the end of 2012. The net decrease is primarily due to project
startups in Canada and Kazakhstan. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted
development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of
approximately 1.9 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by
year-end. The largest transfers were related to Kearl Initial Development
startup and new pad steam injection in the Cold Lake field in Canada, Kashagan
field startup in Kazakhstan and the Groningen compression assessment in the
Netherlands.

One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved
reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the
development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy
and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed.
Development projects typically take two to four years from the time of first
recording of proved reserves to the start of production of these reserves.
However, the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years.
During 2013, discoveries and extensions related to new projects added
approximately 0.7 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. The largest of these
additions were related to planned drilling in the United States and Upper Zakum
field expansion in Abu Dhabi. Overall, investments of $25.3 billion were made
by the Corporation during 2013 to progress the development of reported proved
undeveloped reserves, including $22.7 billion for oil and gas producing
activities and an additional $2.6 billion for other non-oil and gas producing
activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related
facilities that were undertaken to progress the development of proved
undeveloped reserves. These investments represented 66 percent of the $38.2 billion
in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.

Proved undeveloped reserves in Australia, Papua New
Guinea, the United States, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, and the Netherlands have
remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the
capacity of infrastructure, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, as well
as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The
Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced;
however, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors
including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory
approvals, and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels. Of the
proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, 91
percent are contained in the aforementioned countries.  The largest of these is
related to LNG/Gas projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea, where
construction of the initial development is under way. In Kazakhstan, the proved
undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of
the offshore Kashagan field which is included in the North Caspian Production
Sharing Agreement and the Tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a
production license in the Tengiz – Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil
joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to
move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the
Netherlands, the Groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves reported
that are related to installation of future stages of compression. These
reserves will move to proved developed when the additional stages of
compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure.

Average production prices have been calculated by
using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor.
Average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities
for the divisor. The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL)
production used for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production
table in section 3.A. The volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are
the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in
section 3.A. The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from
those shown in the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the
“Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities”
portion of the Financial Section of this report due to volumes consumed or
flared. Gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet
per one thousand barrels.

B. Exploratory and Development
Activities Regarding Oil and Gas Resources Extracted by Mining Technologies

Syncrude Operations.

Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover
shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the
crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees
API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25
percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6
percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited. In 2013, the company’s share of net
production of synthetic crude oil was about 65 thousand barrels per day and
share of net acreage was about 63 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil
sands deposit.

Kearl Project.

The Kearl project is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the
joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent.
Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and
a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of
six oil sands leases covering about 48 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil
sands deposit.

The Kearl project is located approximately 40 miles
north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands
produced from open-pit mining operations, and processed through a bitumen
extraction and froth treatment train. The product, a blend of bitumen and
diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is
natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen
to facilitate transportation by pipeline. Production from the initial
development began in April 2013 and production ramp-up continued throughout the
remainder of the year. During 2013, average net production at Kearl was 21
thousand barrels per day. The Kearl Expansion project was 72 percent complete
at the end of 2013.

6.
Delivery Commitments

ExxonMobil
sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety
of contractual obligations, some of which may specify the delivery of a fixed
and determinable quantity for periods longer than one year. ExxonMobil also
enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas
used to fulfill the contract can be a combination of our own production and the
spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately
2,800 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2014 through 2016.
We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production
from our proved developed reserves. Any remaining commitments will be fulfilled
with production from our proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases
as necessary.

ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped
acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. The terms and
conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production
rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined and vary
significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure
that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before
expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage
in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where
additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has
generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of
leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.


D. Summary of Acreage
Terms

UNITED STATES

Oil and gas leases have an exploration period ranging
from one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains in effect
until production ceases. Under certain circumstances, a lease may be held
beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some
instances, a “fee interest” is acquired where both the surface and the
underlying mineral interests are owned outright.

CANADA / SOUTH AMERICA

Canada

Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are
acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible.
These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or
leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease
agreements are held as long as there is production on the licenses and leases.
Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held
by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a
maximum term of nine years. Production licenses in the offshore are valid for
25 years, with rights of extension for continued production. Significant
discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped
discoveries, do not have a definite term.

Argentina

The federal onshore concession terms in Argentina are
up to four years for the initial exploration period, up to three years for the
second exploration period and up to two years for the third exploration period.
A 50-percent relinquishment is required after each exploration period. An
extension after the third exploration period is possible for up to five years.
The total production term is 25 years with a ten-year extension possible, once
a field has been developed. Argentine provinces are entitled to modify the
concession terms granted within their territories. The concession terms of the
exploration permits granted by Neuquen Province are up to six years for the
initial exploration period, up to four years for the second exploration period
and up to three years for the third exploration period depending on the
classification of the area. An extension after the third exploration period is
possible for up to one year.

EUROPE

Germany

Exploration concessions are granted for an initial
maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of up to
three years each. Extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments.
Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple
possible extensions as long as there is production on the license.

Netherlands

Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003,
exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is
issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the
Mining Law.

Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003,
remain subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and
offshore areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were
indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in
the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued
before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40
years.

Norway

Licenses issued prior to 1972 were for an initial
period of six years and an extension period of 40 years, with relinquishment of
at least one-fourth of the original area required at the end of the sixth year
and another one-fourth at the end of the ninth year. Licenses issued between
1972 and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years (with extension of
the initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985), and an
extension period of up to 30 years, with relinquishment of at least one-half of
the original area required at the end of the initial period. Licenses issued
after July 1, 1997, have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal
extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years, and
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the
end of the initial period.


United Kingdom

Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are
periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the
first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with
relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the
initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any
such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of
production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on
a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate
in all other areas. The licensing regime was last updated in 2002, and the
majority of licenses issued have an initial term of four years with a second
term extension of four years and a final term of 18 years with a mandatory
relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all
acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.

AFRICA

Angola

Exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years
and an optional second phase of two to three years. The production period is
for 25 years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension.

Chad

Exploration permits are issued for a period of five
years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms
and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are
specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is for 30 years and
may be extended at the discretion of the government.

Equatorial Guinea

Exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines,
Industry and Energy. The exploration periods are for 10 to 15 years with limited
relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries. The production period
for crude oil is 30 years, while the production period for gas is 50 years.
Under the Hydrocarbons Law enacted in 2006, the exploration terms for new
production sharing contracts are four to five years with a maximum of two
one-year extensions, unless the Ministry agrees otherwise.

Nigeria

Exploration and production activities in the deepwater
offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with
the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
NNPC holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil
Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a
ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase plus one or two
optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be
converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the
end of the ten-year exploration period, and OMLs have a 20-year production
period that may be extended.

Some exploration activities are carried out in
deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL.
OPLs in deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years and are non-renewable,
while in all other areas the licenses are for five years and also are
non-renewable. Demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion
of an OPL to an OML.

OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e.,
under the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the 1969 Petroleum Act) were for
30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed,
effective December 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further
renewal option of 20 years. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted
under a joint venture agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC. In 2000, a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was executed defining commercial terms
applicable to existing joint venture oil production. The MOU may be terminated
on one calendar year’s notice.

OMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which
include all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction
for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months’ written
notice, for another period of 20 years. OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject
to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their
duration.


ASIA

Azerbaijan

The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the
development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field is established for an initial
period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994.

Other exploration and production activities are
governed by PSAs negotiated with the national oil company of Azerbaijan. The
exploration period consists of three or four years with the possibility of a
one to three-year extension. The production period, which includes development,
is for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year
extensions.

Indonesia

Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are
generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a
production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency
established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. In 2012, Indonesia’s
Constitutional Court ruled certain articles of law relating to BPMIGAS to be
unconstitutional, but stated that all existing PSCs signed with BPMIGAS should
remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties previously
performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry of the
Government of Indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law. The
current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up
to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. PSCs generally require the
contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area after
three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50
percent to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending
on the acreage and terms.

Iraq

Development and production activities in the
state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil
companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a
contract with South Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to
participate in the development and production activities of the West Qurna
Phase I oil and gas field effective March 1, 2010. The term of the
contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. The contract
provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production
above specified levels.

Exploration and production activities in the Kurdistan
Region of Iraq are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the
regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The exploration term is for five
years with the possibility of two-year extensions. The production period is 20
years with the right to extend for five years.

Kazakhstan

Onshore exploration and production activities are
governed by the production license, exploration license and joint venture
agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production
operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.

Offshore exploration and production activities are
governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of
Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal
periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes
development, is for 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with
the possibility of two ten-year extensions.

Malaysia

Exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company.
The more recent PSCs governing exploration and production activities have an
overall term of 24 to 38 years, depending on water depth, with possible
extensions to the exploration and/or development periods. The exploration
period is five to seven years with the possibility of extensions, after which
time areas with no commercial discoveries will be deemed relinquished. The
development period is from four to six years from commercial discovery, with
the possibility of extensions under special circumstances. Areas from which
commercial production has not started by the end of the development period will
be deemed relinquished if no extension is granted. All extensions are subject
to the national oil company’s prior written approval. The total production
period is 15 to 25 years from first commercial lifting, not to exceed the
overall term of the contract.

In 2008, the Company reached agreement with the
national oil company for a new PSC, which was subsequently signed in 2009.
Under the new PSC, from 2008 until March 31, 2012, the Company was entitled to
undertake new development and production activities in oil fields under an
existing PSC, subject to new minimum work and spending commitments, including
an enhanced oil recovery project in one of the oil fields. When the existing
PSC expired on March 31, 2012, the producing fields covered by the existing PSC
automatically became part of the new PSC, which has a 25-year duration from
April 2008.


Qatar

The State of Qatar grants gas production development
project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to
satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects.

Republic of Yemen

The Jannah production sharing agreement has a
development period extending 20 years from first commercial declaration, which
was made in June 1995.

Russia

Terms for ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin acreage are fixed by
the production sharing agreement (PSA) that became effective in 1996 between
the Russian government and the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is
the operator. The term of the PSA is 20 years from the Declaration of
Commerciality, which would be 2021. The term may be extended thereafter in
ten-year increments as specified in the PSA.

Exploration and production activities in the Kara and
Black Seas are governed by joint venture agreements concluded with Rosneft in
2013 that cover certain of Rosneft’s offshore licenses. The Kara Sea licenses
extend through 2040 and include an exploration period through 2020, development
plan submission within eight years of a discovery and development activities
within five years of plan approval.  The Black Sea exploration license extends
through 2017 and a discovery is the basis for obtaining a license for
production.

Thailand

The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under
ExxonMobil’s concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time.

United Arab Emirates

Exploration and production activities for the major
onshore oil fields in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi were governed by a 75-year oil
concession agreement executed in 1939, which expired in January 2014. An
interest in the development and production activities of the Upper Zakum field,
a major offshore field, was acquired effective as of January 2006, for a term
expiring March 2026, and in 2013 the governing agreements were extended to 2041.

AUSTRALIA/OCEANIA

Australia

Exploration and production activities conducted
offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation.
Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two
possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for
resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are
expected to become commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for
periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998,
production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal
of 21 years and thereafter “indefinitely”, i.e., for the life of the field.
Effective from July 1998, new production licenses are granted “indefinitely”.
In each case, a production license may be terminated if no production
operations have been carried on for five years.

Papua New Guinea

Exploration and production activities are governed by
the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum Prospecting licenses are granted for an initial
term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension
of three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent
relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial
six-year term, if extended. Petroleum Development licenses are granted for an
initial 25-year period. An extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the
Minister’s discretion. Petroleum Retention licenses may be granted for gas
resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may become
commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years.
Petroleum Retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be
extended, at the Minister’s discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of
15 years. Extensions of Petroleum Retention licenses may be for periods of less
than one year, renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of
extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five
years.

Item 3.       Legal Proceedings

In November 2013, the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) contacted Exxon Mobil Corporation (the “Corporation”)
concerning alleged violations of the Texas Clean Air Act, implementing
regulations and the applicable new source review permit in connection with
exceedances of volatile organic compound emissions from Tank 22 at the
Corporation’s King Ranch Gas Plant.  TCEQ is seeking a civil penalty in
excess of $100,000 along with certain corrective action.  The Corporation
is working with TCEQ to resolve the matter.

Regarding the June 27, 2013, Administrative Consent
Agreement between the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDOH) and XTO Energy
Inc. (XTO) resolving the air enforcement matter previously reported in the
Corporation’s Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2013, pursuant to
the terms of the Administrative Consent Agreement, during the fourth quarter of
2013, XTO provided the NDDOH with an
updated list of well sites on newly acquired assets with air emission control
issues. On November 12, 2013, XTO paid an additional penalty assessment of
$183,400 with respect to those sites.

the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office pertaining to XTO’s Marquardt Well
Site in Penn Township, Pennsylvania, reported most recently in the
Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2013, on January 2, 2014, a
Pennsylvania state magistrate ruled that the Attorney General’s Office had
presented sufficient evidence for the charges to proceed to trial in the
Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas.  At the trial, XTO will have an opportunity
to present its full defense to the charges, which it believes are unwarranted.

Regarding the settlement of matters between the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
(LDEQ) and ExxonMobil Refining and Supply Company and ExxonMobil Chemical
Company, both divisions of the Corporation, involving ExxonMobil facilities in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the
third quarter of 2013, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the public comment
period on the proposed settlement ended, and the Louisiana Attorney General
issued his concurrence with regard to the settlement terms. The parties
executed the final documents in January 2014, thereby resolving the matters
covered by the settlement. The settlement terms include payment of a $300,000
penalty, an agreement to complete certain on-site improvement projects valued
at $1,000,000, Beneficial Environmental Projects valued at $1,029,000 and a
Stipulated Penalty Agreement to address any future environmental
non-compliance.

On December 11, 2013,  the TCEQ Commissioner’s Court accepted and signed the
Agreed Order settling the enforcement action, including a penalty of $126,250, concerning
emission events at ExxonMobil Oil Corporation’s (EMOC) Beaumont Refinery
previously reported in the Corporation’s Forms 10-Q for the first and third
quarters of 2013.

Regarding the complaint
against EMOC filed by the Attorney General for the State of New York alleging
contamination of soil and groundwater at a former Mobil petroleum terminal at
Lighthouse Point in Ogdensburg, New York, previously reported in the
Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2011, the parties reached a
settlement agreement that was entered into the court record on November 14,
2013. On December 16, 2013, the parties signed the agreement, and EMOC made a
payment to the State of $8.05 million, pursuant to the agreement’s terms.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

Listed below are definitions of several of
ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures. These definitions
are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.

Cash Flow From Operations and Asset Sales

Cash flow
from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by
operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries,
property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources
of cash from both operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of
assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review
process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s
strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these
objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular
nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider
proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating
activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and
financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Capital Employed

Capital
employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of
how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil’s net share
of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding
both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the
sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes
ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include
ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the
Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure
of capital employed.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

Return on Average Capital Employed

Return on
average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the
perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings
divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and
end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of
segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed
definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is
net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of
financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation
has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the
best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive,
long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to
demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long
term. Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make
investment decisions.

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements
in this discussion regarding expectations, plans and future events or
conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including
demand growth and energy source mix; capacity increases; production growth and
mix; rates of field decline; financing sources; the resolution of contingencies
and uncertain tax positions; environmental and capital expenditures; could
differ materially depending on a number of factors, such as changes in the
supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum and
petrochemical products; the outcome of commercial negotiations; political or
regulatory events, and other factors discussed herein and in Item 1A. Risk
Factors.

The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of
different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any
government payment transparency reports.

OVERVIEW

The
following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil’s financial results, as well as
the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the
management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation’s accounting and
financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving
the extracting, manufacturing and marketing of hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon-based products. The Corporation’s business model involves the
production (or purchase), manufacture and sale of physical products, and all
commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical
movement of goods.

ExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined
investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate
in substantial investments to develop new energy supplies. While commodity
prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on supply and demand,
ExxonMobil’s investment decisions are based on our long-term business outlook,
using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive
investment opportunities. The corporate plan is a fundamental annual management
process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and capital
objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic assumptions used
for investment evaluation purposes. Volumes are based on individual field
production profiles, which are also updated annually. Price ranges for crude
oil, natural gas, refined products, and chemical products are based on
corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are utilized
for investment evaluation purposes. Potential investment opportunities are
tested over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of
each opportunity. Once investments are made, a reappraisal process is completed
to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into
future projects.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

Long-Term Business Outlook

By 2040, the
world’s population is projected to grow to approximately 8.8 billion
people, or close to 2 billion more than in 2010. Coincident with this
population increase, the Corporation expects worldwide economic growth to
average close to 3 percent per year. As economies and populations grow,
and as living standards improve for billions of people, the need for energy
will continue to rise.  Even with significant efficiency gains, global energy
demand is projected to rise by about 35 percent from 2010 to 2040. This demand
increase is expected to be concentrated in developing countries (i.e., those
that are not member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development).

As expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher, increasing
use of energy-efficient and lower-emission fuels, technologies and practices will
continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions per unit
of economic output over time. Substantial efficiency gains are likely in all
key aspects of the world’s economy through 2040, affecting energy requirements
for transportation, power generation, industrial applications, and residential
and commercial needs.

Energy for transportation – including cars, trucks, ships, trains and
airplanes – is expected to increase by about 40 percent from 2010 to 2040.
The global growth in transportation demand is likely to account for
approximately 70 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand over this
period. Nearly all the world’s transportation fleets will continue to run on
liquid fuels because they are abundant, widely available, easy to transport,
and provide a large quantity of energy in small volumes.

Demand for electricity around the world is likely to increase
approximately 90 percent by 2040, led by growth in developing countries.
Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the
largest and fastest-growing major segment of global energy demand. Meeting the
expected growth in power demand will require a diverse set of energy sources. Natural
gas demand is likely to grow most significantly and become the leading source
of generated electricity by 2040, reflecting the efficiency of gas-fired power
plants.  Today, coal has the largest fuel share in the power sector, but its
share is likely to decline significantly by 2040 as policies are gradually
adopted to reduce environmental impacts including those related to local air
quality and greenhouse gas emissions.  Nuclear power and renewables, led by hydropower
and wind, are also expected to grow significantly over the period.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquid fuels provide the largest share of global energy
supplies today due to their broad-based availability, affordability and ease of
transportation, distribution and storage to meet consumer needs. By 2040,
global demand for liquid fuels is expected to grow to approximately 112 million
barrels of oil‑equivalent per day, an increase of about 25 percent
from 2010. This demand will be met by a wide variety of sources. Globally, conventional
crude production will likely decline slightly through 2040. However, this
decline is expected to be more than offset by rising production from a wide
variety of emerging supply sources – including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands,
natural gas liquids and biofuels.  The world’s resource base is sufficient to
meet projected demand through 2040 as technology advances continue to expand
the availability of economic supply options. However, access to resources and
timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable,
affordable supplies.

Natural gas is a versatile fuel, suitable for a wide variety of
applications, and is expected to be the fastest growing major fuel source
through 2040.  Global demand is expected to rise about 65 percent from
2010 to 2040, with demand likely to increase in all major regions of the world.
Helping meet these needs will be significant growth in supplies of
unconventional gas – the natural gas found in shale and other rock formations
that was once considered uneconomic to produce.  About 65 percent of the
growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources,
which will account for about one-third of global gas supplies by 2040.  Growing
natural gas demand will also stimulate significant growth in the worldwide
liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, which is expected to reach about 15 percent
of global gas demand by 2040.

The world’s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through
2040. Oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share
remaining close to one-third in 2040.  Coal is currently the second largest
source of energy, but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas by
approximately 2025.  The share of natural gas is expected to exceed 25 percent
by 2040, while the share of coal falls to less than 20 percent. Nuclear
power is projected to grow significantly, albeit at a slower pace than
otherwise expected in the aftermath of the Fukushima incident in Japan
following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.  Total renewable energy is
likely to reach close to 15 percent of total energy by 2040, with biomass,
hydro and geothermal contributing a combined share of about 11 percent. 
Total energy supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase
close to 450 percent from 2010 to 2040, reaching a combined share of about
4 percent of world energy.

The Corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas
resource base will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from reserve
increases in previously discovered fields.  Technology will underpin these
increases. The cost to develop and supply these resources will be significant.
According to the International Energy Agency, the investment required to meet
total oil and gas energy needs worldwide over the period 2012‑2035 will
be close to $19 trillion (measured in 2011 dollars) or close to $800 billion
per year on average.

International accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering
greenhouse gas emissions are evolving with uncertain timing and outcome, making
it difficult to predict their business impact.  ExxonMobil includes estimates
of potential costs related to possible public policies covering energy-related
greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook for Energy, which is used for
assessing the business environment and in its investment evaluations.

The information provided in the Long-Term Business Outlook includes
ExxonMobil’s internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data and
analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources
including the International Energy Agency.

Upstream

ExxonMobil
continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of exploration and development
opportunities, which enables the Corporation to be selective, maximizing
shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil’s
fundamental Upstream business strategies guide our global exploration,
development, production, and gas and power marketing activities. These
strategies include identifying and selectively capturing the highest quality
opportunities, exercising a disciplined approach to investing and cost
management, developing and applying high-impact technologies, maximizing the
profitability of existing oil and gas production, and capitalizing on growing
natural gas and power markets.   These strategies are underpinned by a
relentless focus on operational excellence, commitment to innovative
technologies, development of our employees, and investment in the communities
within which we operate.

As future development projects and drilling activities bring new
production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix of its
production volumes between now and 2018. Oil equivalent production from North
America is expected to increase over the next five years based on current
capital activity plans. Currently, this growth area accounts for 32 percent
of the Corporation’s production. By 2018, it is expected to generate about 35 percent
of total volumes. The remainder of the Corporation’s production is expected to
include contributions from both established operations and new projects around
the globe.

In addition to an evolving geographic mix, we expect there will also be
continued change in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced.
Production from diverse resource types utilizing specialized technologies such
as arctic technology, deepwater drilling and production systems, heavy oil and
oil sands recovery processes, unconventional gas and oil production and


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LNG is expected to grow from about 45 percent to
around 55 percent of the Corporation’s output between now and 2018. We do
not anticipate that the expected change in the geographic mix of production
volumes, and in the types of opportunities from which volumes will be produced,
will have a material impact on the nature and the extent of the risks disclosed
in Item 1A. Risk Factors, or result in a material change in our level of unit
operating expenses. The Corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook, based on
projects coming onstream as anticipated, is for production capacity to grow
over the period 2014‑2018. However, actual volumes will vary from year to
year due to the timing of individual project start-ups and other capital
activities, operational outages, reservoir performance, performance of enhanced
oil recovery projects, regulatory changes, asset sales, weather events, price
effects under production sharing contracts and other factors described in Item
1A. Risk Factors. Enhanced oil recovery projects extract hydrocarbons from
reservoirs in excess of that which may be produced through primary recovery,
i.e., through pressure depletion or natural aquifer support. They include the
injection of water, gases or chemicals into a reservoir to produce hydrocarbons
otherwise unobtainable.

Downstream

ExxonMobil’s
Downstream is a large, diversified business with refining, logistics, and
marketing complexes around the world. The Corporation has a presence in mature
markets in North America and Europe, as well as in the growing Asia Pacific
region. ExxonMobil’s fundamental Downstream business strategies position the
company to deliver long-term growth in shareholder value that is superior to
competition across a range of market conditions. These strategies include
maintaining best‑in‑class operations in all aspects of the
business, maximizing value from leading-edge technologies, capitalizing on
integration across ExxonMobil businesses, selectively investing for resilient,
advantaged returns, leading the industry in efficiency and effectiveness, and
providing quality, valued products and services to customers.

ExxonMobil has an ownership interest in 31 refineries, located in 17
countries, with distillation capacity of 5.3 million barrels per day and
lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of 126 thousand barrels per
day. ExxonMobil’s fuels and lubes marketing businesses have significant global
reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse customer base.  Our
portfolio of world-renowned brands includes

The downstream industry environment remains challenging.  Demand
weakness and overcapacity in the refining sector will continue to put pressure
on margins.  In the near term, we see variability in refining margins, with
some regions seeing stronger margins as refineries rationalize. In North
America, lower raw material and energy cost driven by increasing crude oil and
natural gas production has strengthened refining margins in several areas.

Refining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices
and are a function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw
materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products
produced (primarily gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel oil).
Crude oil and many products are widely traded with published prices, including
those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., New York Mercantile
Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are
determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors,
including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry
refinery operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal
demand, weather and political climate.

ExxonMobil’s long‑term outlook is that industry refining margins
will remain weak as competition remains intense and, in the near term, new
capacity additions outpace the growth in global demand. Additionally, as
described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors, proposed carbon policy and
other climate-related regulations in many countries, as well as the continued
growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the refining
business.  ExxonMobil’s integration across the value chain, from refining to
marketing, enhances overall value in both fuels and lubricants businesses.

In the retail fuels marketing business, competition has caused
inflation-adjusted margins to decline. In 2013, ExxonMobil completed the previously
announced transition of the direct served (i.e., dealer, company-operated)
retail network in the U.S. to a more capital-efficient branded distributor
model and progressed this same model in portions of Europe.  ExxonMobil is
increasing investment in its fuels brands and developing multiple programs that
will enhance the value of its consumer retail offer.  The company’s lubricants
business continues to grow, leveraging world-class brands and integration with
industry-leading basestock refining capability.  ExxonMobil remains the market
leader in the high‑value synthetic lubricants sector where competition is
increasing.

The Downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all parts of
the business cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past
decade. When investing in the Downstream, ExxonMobil remains focused on
selective and resilient projects.  These investments capitalize on the
Corporation’s world-class scale and integration, industry leading efficiency,
leading-edge technology and respected brands, enabling ExxonMobil to take
advantage of attractive emerging growth opportunities around the globe.  In 2013,
the company completed a hydrotreater project at the Singapore refinery to
produce ultra‑low sulfur diesel, and a cogeneration project at the Augusta,
Italy refinery to improve energy efficiency.  Additionally, construction of a
lower sulfur fuels facility at the joint Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil SAMREF
Refinery in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia is nearly complete.  The company is also
expanding lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity at refineries in Baytown,

petrochemical demand grew in 2013, led by growing demand from Asia
manufacturers and consumers.  North America continued to benefit from abundant
supplies of natural gas and gas liquids, providing both low-cost feedstock and
energy savings.  Specialty product margins declined reflecting significant new
industry capacity following several years of tight supplies.

ExxonMobil sustained its competitive advantage through continued
operational excellence, investment and cost discipline, a balanced portfolio of
products, integration with refining and upstream operations, all underpinned by
proprietary technology.

In 2013 ExxonMobil started up the Singapore Chemical Expansion Project,
more than doubling steam‑cracking capacity at the site and significantly
increasing premium and specialty products capacity.  Singapore is now
ExxonMobil’s largest integrated petrochemical complex.

Upstream earnings were $26,841 million, down $3,054 million
from 2012.  Higher gas realizations, partially offset by lower liquids
realizations, increased earnings by $390 million.  Production volume and
mix effects decreased earnings by $910 million.  All other items,
including lower net gains from asset sales, mainly in Angola, and higher
expenses, reduced earnings by $2.5 billion.  On an oil‑equivalent
basis, production was down 1.5 percent compared to 2012.  Excluding the
impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production
was essentially flat.  Liquids production of 2,202 kbd (thousands of
barrels per day) increased 17 kbd compared with 2012.  Excluding the
impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids
production was up 1.6 percent, as project ramp‑up and lower downtime
were partially offset by field decline.  Natural gas production of 11,836 mcfd
(millions of cubic feet per day) decreased 486 mcfd from 2012.  Excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was
down 1.5 percent, as field decline was partially offset by higher demand, lower
downtime, and project ramp‑up.  Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations
for 2013 were $4,191 million, up $266 million from 2012.  Earnings
outside the U.S. were $22,650 million, down $3,320 million from the
prior year.


Upstream earnings were $29,895 million, down
$4,544 million from 2011.  Lower liquids realizations, partly offset by
improved natural gas realizations, decreased earnings by about $100 million. 
Production volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $2.3 billion.  All
other items, including higher operating expenses, unfavorable tax items, lower
gains on asset sales, and unfavorable foreign exchange effects, reduced
earnings by $2.1 billion.  On an oil‑equivalent basis, production
was down 5.9 percent compared to 2011.  Excluding the impacts of

Listed below are descriptions of
ExxonMobil’s entitlement volume effects. These descriptions are provided to
facilitate understanding of the terms.

Production Sharing Contract (PSC)
Net Interest Reductions

are contractual reductions in ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes covered
by PSCs. These reductions typically occur when cumulative investment returns or
production volumes achieve thresholds as specified in the PSCs. Once a net
interest reduction has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.

Price and Spend Impacts on
Volumes

are
fluctuations in ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by changes in
oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. For example,
at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its
costs. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty
regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens
and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. These effects generally vary from
period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for crude oil or
natural gas.

Total cash
and cash equivalents were $4.9 billion at the end of 2013, $5.0 billion lower
than the prior year.  The major sources of funds in 2013 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $33.4 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $17.2 billion for depreciation and depletion, and a net
debt increase of $11.6 billion.  The major uses of funds included spending for
additions to property, plant and equipment of $33.7 billion, the purchase of
shares of ExxonMobil stock of $16.0 billion, dividends to shareholders of $10.9
billion and a change in working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $4.7
billion.  Included in total cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2013 was $0.3
billion of restricted cash.

Total cash and cash equivalents were $9.9 billion at the end of 2012,
$3.1 billion lower than the prior year. Higher earnings and a higher adjustment
for noncash transactions were more than offset by lower proceeds from sales of
subsidiaries and property, plant and equipment, a net debt decrease compared to
a prior year debt increase, and a higher adjustment for net gains on asset
sales.  Included in total cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2012 was $0.3
billion of restricted cash.  For additional details, see the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and
short-term liquidity.  Internally generated funds are expected to cover the
majority of financial requirements, and may be supplemented by long-term and
short-term debt, including a revolving commercial paper program.  The
Corporation has committed lines of credit of $6.5 billion which were unused as
of December 31, 2013.  Cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the
Corporation’s immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality
and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet
the Corporation’s cash requirements and to optimize returns.

To support cash flows in future periods the Corporation will need to
continually find and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new
technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or
increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the
nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the
remainder of their economic life. Averaged over all the Corporation’s existing
oil and gas fields and without new projects, ExxonMobil’s production is
expected to decline at an average of approximately 3 percent per year over the
next few years. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a
number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid
properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field.
Furthermore, the Corporation’s net interest in production for individual fields
can vary with price and contractual terms.

The Corporation has long been successful at offsetting the effects of
natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities
and project execution. Over the last decade, this has resulted in net annual
additions to proved reserves that have exceeded the amount produced. Projects
are in progress or planned to increase production capacity. However, these
volume increases are subject to a variety of risks including project start-up
timing, operational outages, reservoir performance, crude oil and natural gas
prices, weather events, and regulatory changes. The Corporation’s cash flows
are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to
Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of risks.

The Corporation’s financial strength enables it to make large,
long-term capital expenditures. Capital and exploration expenditures in 2013
were $42.5 billion, reflecting the Corporation’s continued active investment
program. The Corporation anticipates an average investment profile of about $37
billion per year for the next several years. Actual spending could vary
depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.  The
Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development projects and
exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and
technical risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and associated cash flow.
Further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and diverse portfolio of
opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project
would not have a significant impact on the

liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its
fixed commitments. The purchase and sale of oil and gas properties have not had
a significant impact on the amount or timing of cash flows from operating
activities.

Cash Flow from
Operating Activities


Cash provided by operating activities totaled $44.9
billion in 2013, $11.3 billion lower than 2012. The major source of funds was
net income including noncontrolling interests of $33.4 billion, a decrease of
$14.2 billion.  The noncash provision of $17.2 billion for depreciation and
depletion was higher than 2012. The adjustment for net gains on asset sales was
$1.8 billion compared to an adjustment of $13.0 billion in 2012.  Changes in
operational working capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash in 2013 by
$4.7 billion.


Cash provided by operating activities totaled $56.2
billion in 2012, $0.8 billion higher than 2011. The major source of funds was
net income including noncontrolling interests of $47.7 billion, an increase of
$5.5 billion.  The noncash provision of $15.9 billion for depreciation and
depletion was slightly higher than 2011.  The adjustments for other noncash
transactions and changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and
debt, both increased cash in 2012, while the adjustment for net gains on asset
sales decreased cash by $13.0 billion in 2012.

Cash Flow from
Investing Activities


Cash used in investment activities netted to $34.2
billion in 2013, $8.6 billion higher than 2012. Spending for property, plant
and equipment of $33.7 billion decreased $0.6 billion from 2012. Proceeds
associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales
and returns of investments of $2.7 billion compared to $7.7 billion in 2012.
Additional investments and advances were $3.8 billion higher in 2013.


Cash used in investment activities netted to $25.6
billion in 2012, $3.4 billion higher than 2011. Spending for property, plant
and equipment of $34.3 billion increased $3.3 billion from 2011. Proceeds
associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales
and returns of investments of $7.7 billion compared to $11.1 billion in 2011.
The decrease reflects that a $3.6 billion deposit was received in 2011 for a
sale that closed in 2012. Additional investments and advances were $3.0 billion
lower in 2012.

Cash Flow from
Financing Activities


Cash used in
financing activities was $15.5 billion in 2013, $18.4 billion lower than 2012.
Dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.46 per share from $2.18 per
share and totaled $10.9 billion, a pay-out of 33 percent of net income. Total
debt increased $11.1 billion to $22.7 billion at year-end.

ExxonMobil share of equity increased $8.1 billion to $174.0 billion.
The addition to equity for earnings of $32.6 billion was partially offset by
reductions for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $10.9 billion of
dividends and $15.0 billion of purchases of shares of ExxonMobil stock to
reduce shares outstanding.

During 2013, Exxon Mobil
Corporation purchased 177 million shares of its common stock for the treasury
at a gross cost of $16.0 billion. These purchases were to reduce the number of
shares outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company
benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced by 3.7 percent from
4,502 million to 4,335 million at the end of 2013. Purchases were made in both
the open market and through negotiated transactions. Purchases may be
increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.


Cash used in
financing activities was $33.9 billion in 2012, $5.6 billion higher than 2011.
Dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.18 per share from $1.85 per
share and totaled $10.1 billion, a pay-out of 22 percent of net income. Total
debt decreased $5.5 billion to $11.6 billion at year-end.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ExxonMobil share of equity increased $11.5 billion to
$165.9 billion. The addition to equity for earnings of $44.9 billion was
partially offset by reductions for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of
$10.1 billion of dividends and $20.0 billion of purchases of shares of
ExxonMobil stock to reduce shares outstanding.

During 2012, Exxon Mobil
Corporation purchased 244 million shares of its common stock for the treasury
at a gross cost of $21.1 billion. These purchases were to reduce the number of
shares outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company
benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced by 4.9 percent from
4,734 million to 4,502 million at the end of 2012. Purchases were made in both

This table
excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or

highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts with
similar pricing terms. Examples include long-term, noncancelable LNG and
natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products
at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in
assessing liquidity and cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in
the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. The
table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $7.8 billion as of
December 31, 2013, because the Corporation is unable to make reasonably
reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing
authorities. Further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in
Note 19, Income, Sales-Based and Other Taxes.

Notes:

(1)   Includes capitalized lease
obligations of $375 million.

(2)   The amount due in one year is
included in notes and loans payable of $15,808 million.

(3)   The fair value of asset
retirement obligations, primarily upstream asset removal costs at the
completion of field life.

(4)   The amount by which the
benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain U.S. and
non-U.S. pension and other postretirement plans at year end. The payments by
period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2014 and
estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years.

(5)   Minimum commitments for
operating leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment,
tankers, service stations and other properties.

(6)   Unconditional purchase
obligations (UPOs) are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or
cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to
secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. The undiscounted obligations of $1,236 million mainly pertain to
pipeline throughput agreements and include $457 million of obligations to
equity companies.

(7)   Take-or-pay obligations are
noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services other than UPOs.
The undiscounted obligations of $29,610 million mainly pertain to pipeline, manufacturing
supply and terminaling agreements.

(8)   Firm commitments related to
capital projects, shown on an undiscounted basis, totaled approximately $29.8
billion. These commitments were primarily associated with Upstream projects
outside the U.S., of which $16.3 billion was associated with projects in Canada,
Australia, Africa, United Arab Emirates and Malaysia.  The Corporation expects
to fund the majority of these projects with internally generated funds that may be supplemented by
long-term and short-term debt, including a revolving commercial paper program.

Guarantees

The
Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently
liable at December 31, 2013, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and
performance under contracts (Note 16). Where guarantees for environmental
remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts
reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees
are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Financial Strength

On
December 31, 2013, the Corporation’s unused short-term committed lines of credit
totaled approximately $5.9 billion (Note 6) and unused long-term committed
lines of credit totaled approximately $0.6 billion (Note 14).

The table below shows the Corporation’s fixed-charge coverage
and consolidated debt-to-capital ratios. The data demonstrate the
Corporation’s creditworthiness.

Management
views the Corporation’s financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial
ratios and other similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic
importance. The Corporation’s sound financial position gives it the opportunity
to access the world’s capital markets in the full range of market conditions,
and enables the Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in
the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.

Litigation and Other Contingencies

As discussed
in Note 16, a variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain
of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Based on a
consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not
believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against
ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported
financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating
results or financial condition. Refer to Note 16 for additional information on
legal proceedings and other contingencies.

  Exploration expenses included.

Capital and
exploration expenditures in 2013 were $42.5 billion, including $4.3 billion for
acquisitions, as the Corporation continued to pursue opportunities to find and
produce new supplies of oil and natural gas to meet global demand for energy. 
The Corporation anticipates an average investment profile of about $37 billion
per year for the next several years. Actual spending could vary depending on
the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.

Upstream spending of $38.2 billion in 2013 was up 6 percent from 2012. 
Property acquisition costs in the Upstream in 2013 of $4.2 billion were $1.2
billion higher than in 2012.  Investments in 2013 included projects in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, exploration in Russia and continued progress on
world-class projects in Canada, Australia and Papua New Guinea.  The majority
of expenditures are on development projects, which typically take two to four
years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of
production from those reserves. The percentage of proved developed reserves was
66 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2013, and has been over 60
percent for the last ten years, indicating that proved reserves are consistently
moved from undeveloped to developed status.

Capital investments in the Downstream totaled $2.4 billion in 2013, an
increase of $0.2 billion from 2012, mainly reflecting higher refining margin
improvement project spending. The Chemical capital expenditures of $1.8 billion
increased $0.4 billion from 2012 with higher investments in the U.S., Saudi
Arabia and China more than offsetting reduced spending on the completed
Singapore Chemical Plant expansion.

Throughout
ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and
minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground. These
include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to
manufacture clean fuels as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen
oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions and expenditures for asset
retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American
Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2013 worldwide environmental expenditures for
all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of
equity company expenditures, were about $6.0 billion. The total cost
for such activities is expected to remain in this range in 2014 and 2015 (with
capital expenditures approximately 45 percent of the total).

Environmental Liabilities

The
Corporation accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that
obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously
disposed. ExxonMobil has accrued liabilities for probable environmental
remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified ExxonMobil as one of the
potentially responsible parties. The involvement of other financially
responsible companies at these multiparty sites could mitigate ExxonMobil’s
actual joint and several liability exposure. At present, no individual site is
expected to have losses material to ExxonMobil’s operations or financial
condition. Consolidated company provisions made in 2013 for environmental
liabilities were $321 million ($391 million in 2012) and the balance
sheet reflects accumulated liabilities of $773 million as of
December 31, 2013, and $841 million as of December 31, 2012.

Crude oil,
natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response
to changing market forces. The impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings
from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. In the Upstream,
a $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil
would have approximately a $350 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream
consolidated plus equity company earnings. Similarly, a $0.10 per kcf change in
the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $175 million
annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings.
For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be
dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, taxes and
other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas
contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in
benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of
changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.

In the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings
are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of
products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a
refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices
for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations,
import/export balances and weather.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The global energy markets can
give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or
more of the Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along with the
capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times associated
with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong
financial position. Management views the Corporation’s financial strength as a
competitive advantage.

In general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell
and/or purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where such sales take
place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of
integrated refinery/chemical complexes. Additionally, intersegment sales are at
market-based prices. The products bought and sold between segments can also be
acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and
transportation capabilities. About 35 percent of the Corporation’s intersegment
sales are crude oil produced by the Upstream and sold to the Downstream. Other
intersegment sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related
to raw materials, feedstocks and finished products.

Although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall
significantly over the short to medium term due to political events, OPEC
actions and other factors, industry economics over the long term will continue
to be driven by market supply and demand. Accordingly, the Corporation tests
the viability of all of its investments over a broad range of future prices.
The Corporation’s assessment is that its operations will continue to be successful
in a variety of market conditions. This is the outcome of disciplined
investment and asset management programs.

The Corporation has an active asset management program in which
underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered
for divestment. The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular
review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s
strategic objectives. The result is an efficient capital base, and the
Corporation has seldom had to write down the carrying value of assets, even
during periods of low commodity prices.

Risk Management

The
Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the
complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce
the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency
rates and commodity prices. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of
derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes. With respect to
derivatives activities, the Corporation believes that there are no material
market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of
operations or liquidity as a result of the derivatives described in Note 13.
The Corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or
derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged
features. Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is
mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges
and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties.
The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization,
reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.

The Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on
its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating
interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates
affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow
or fair value. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term
and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the
majority of financial requirements, and may be supplemented by long-term and
short-term debt, including a revolving commercial paper program. Some
joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets, and their funding
ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture projects.

The Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is
subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses,
financing and investment transactions. The impacts of fluctuations in exchange
rates on ExxonMobil’s geographically and functionally diverse operations are
varied and often offsetting in amount. The Corporation makes limited use of
currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency
values, and exposures related to the Corporation’s limited use of the currency
exchange contracts are not material.

Inflation and Other Uncertainties

The general
rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained moderate
over the past few years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs has
generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity
improvements. Increased demand for certain services and materials has resulted
in higher operating and capital costs in recent years. The Corporation works to
counter upward pressure on costs through its economies of scale in global
procurement and its efficient project management practices.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its
straightforward business model involving the extracting, refining and marketing
of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting
policies are summarized in Note 1.

Oil and Gas Reserves

Evaluations
of oil and gas reserves are important to the effective management of upstream
assets. They are an integral part of investment decisions about oil and gas
properties such as whether development should proceed. Oil and gas reserve
quantities are also used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production
depreciation rates and to evaluate impairment.

Oil and gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves. Proved
oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to
be economically producible. Unproved reserves are those with less than
reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable reserves. Probable
reserves are reserves that are more likely to be recovered than not.

The estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on
rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessment, and detailed
analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure
declines. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation
through long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a
well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and
engineering professionals, assisted by the Reserves Technical Oversight group
which has significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and
approval by senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific
quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the
reserve estimation process are covered in Disclosure of Reserves in
Item 2.

Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves
will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number
of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance,
regulatory approvals and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price
levels.

Proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and
undeveloped reserves. The percentage of proved developed reserves was 66
percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2013 (including both consolidated
and equity company reserves), and has been over 60 percent for the last ten
years, indicating that proved reserves are consistently moved from undeveloped
to developed status.

Revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously
estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation
or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or
production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or
(3) changes in prices and year-end costs that are used in the estimation
of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in development
strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.

Impact of
Oil and Gas Reserves on Depreciation.

The calculation of unit-of-production depreciation is a critical accounting
estimate that measures the depreciation of upstream assets. It is the ratio of
actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves (those proved
reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods), applied to the asset cost. The volumes produced and asset
cost are known and, while proved developed reserves have a high probability of
recoverability, they are based on estimates that are subject to some
variability. While the revisions the Corporation has made in the past are an
indicator of variability, they have had a very small impact on the
unit-of-production rates because they have been small compared to the large
reserves base.

Impact of
Oil and Gas Reserves and Prices on Testing for Impairment.

Proved oil and gas properties held and used by the
Corporation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped
at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are
largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.

The Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the
affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. Impairment
analyses are generally based on proved reserves. Where probable reserves exist,
an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the
impairment evaluation. An asset group would be impaired if its undiscounted
cash flows were less than the asset’s carrying value. Impairments are measured
by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value.

Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment
individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are
recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of
time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are
not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on
development risk and average holding period.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Corporation performs asset valuation analyses on
an ongoing basis as a part of its asset management program. These analyses
assist the Corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its
assets may not be recoverable. In addition to estimating oil and gas reserve
volumes in conducting these analyses, it is also necessary to estimate future
oil and gas prices. Potential trigger events for impairment evaluation include
a significant decrease in current and projected reserve volumes, an
accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally
expected, and current period operating losses combined with a history and
forecast of operating or cash flow losses.

In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or
margins as a trigger event for conducting the impairment tests. The markets for
crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility.
Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the
long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. On the supply
side, industry production from mature fields is declining, but this is being
offset by production from new discoveries and field developments. OPEC
production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side
is largely a function of global economic growth. The relative growth/decline in
supply versus demand will determine industry prices over the long term, and
these cannot be accurately predicted.

Accordingly, any impairment tests that the Corporation performs make
use of the Corporation’s price assumptions developed in the annual planning and
budgeting process for the crude oil and natural gas markets, petroleum products
and chemicals. These are the same price assumptions that are used for capital
investment decisions. Volumes are based on field production profiles, which are
updated annually. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the
effects of derivative instruments.

Supplemental information regarding oil and gas results of operations,
capitalized costs and reserves is provided following the notes to consolidated
financial statements. Future prices used for any impairment tests will vary
from the ones used in the supplemental oil and gas disclosure and could be
lower or higher for any given year.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The
Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair
value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations
are disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements.

Suspended Exploratory Well Costs

The
Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well
has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory
well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. The facts and
circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end
are disclosed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

Consolidations

The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of those subsidiaries
that the Corporation controls. They also include the Corporation’s share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. Amounts representing the Corporation’s interest in the underlying net
assets of other significant entities that it does not control, but over which
it exercises significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting.

Investments in companies that are partially owned by
the Corporation are integral to the Corporation’s operations. In some cases
they serve to balance worldwide risks, and in others they provide the only
available means of entry into a particular market or area of interest. The
other parties who also have an equity interest in these companies are either
independent third parties or host governments that share in the business
results according to their ownership. The Corporation does not invest in these
companies in order to remove liabilities from its balance sheet. In fact, the
Corporation has long been on record supporting an alternative accounting method
that would require each investor to consolidate its share of all assets and
liabilities in these partially owned companies rather than only its interest in
net equity. This method of accounting for investments in partially-owned
companies is not permitted by U.S. GAAP except where the investments are in the
direct ownership of a share of upstream assets and liabilities. However, for
purposes of calculating return on average capital employed, which is not
covered by U.S. GAAP standards, the Corporation includes its share of debt of
these partially-owned companies in the determination of average capital
employed.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Pension Benefits

The
Corporation and its affiliates sponsor over 100 defined benefit (pension) plans
in about 50 countries. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Note 17)
provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense.

Some of these plans (primarily non-U.S.) provide
pension benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of
corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund. Book reserves are
established for these plans because tax conventions and regulatory practices do
not encourage advance funding. The portion of the pension cost attributable to
employee service is expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable
to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over
the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary
difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension
expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term
return on fund assets.

For funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension
obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance
arrangements. These plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of
governmental authorities and meet or exceed required funding levels as measured
by relevant actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement
dates. In determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards
often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for
accounting purposes.

The Corporation will continue to make contributions to
these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations,
regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported
by the financial strength of the Corporation or the respective sponsoring
affiliate.

Pension accounting requires explicit assumptions
regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets,
the discount rate for the benefit obligations and the long-term rate for future
salary increases. Pension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside
actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate
to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings
rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2013 was 7.25 percent. The 10‑year
and 20‑year actual returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 7 percent and
9 percent, respectively. The Corporation establishes the long-term expected
rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for
each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected
real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term
rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset
class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on
assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $150 million
before tax.

Differences between actual returns on fund assets and
the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year
that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other
actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the
expected remaining service life of employees.

Litigation Contingencies

A
variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular
litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to
assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16.

The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for
those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. These amounts are not reduced by amounts that may
be recovered under insurance or claims against third parties, but undiscounted
receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately. The
Corporation revises such accruals in light of new information. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our litigation
contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as
other items which management believes should be disclosed.

Management judgment is required related to contingent
liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to
predict. However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation
in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on operations or
financial condition. In the Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not
result in large awards. Large awards are often reversed or substantially
reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.

Tax Contingencies

The
Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the
world. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income
tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to
predict.

The benefits of uncertain tax positions
that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are
recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

with
the tax authorities. For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit
recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that
is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. A reserve is established
for the difference between a position taken or expected to be taken in an
income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The
Corporation’s unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are
summarized in Note 19.

Foreign Currency Translation

The
method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the
Corporation’s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars is prescribed by
GAAP. Under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency
of these subsidiaries. The functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment.

Factors considered by management when determining the functional
currency for a subsidiary include the currency used for cash flows related to
individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to
changes in exchange rates; the history of inflation in the country; whether
sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw
materials, labor, services and supplies; sources of financing; and significance
of intercompany transactions.


MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

Management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive
Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer, is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the
Corporation’s financial reporting. Management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Exxon Mobil Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2013.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, as stated in
their report included in the Financial Section of this report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders of Exxon Mobil
Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income,
Changes in Equity and Cash Flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Exxon Mobil Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2013, and 2012, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporation’s management
is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on
the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and
the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility of the
management of Exxon Mobil Corporation.

The Corporation’s principal business is energy,
involving the worldwide exploration, production, transportation and sale of
crude oil and natural gas (Upstream) and the manufacture, transportation and
sale of petroleum products (Downstream). The Corporation is also a major
worldwide manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals (Chemical) and
participates in electric power generation (Upstream).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management
to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Actual results could differ from these estimates. Prior years’ data has been
reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2013 presentation basis.

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Principles
of Consolidation.

The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the Corporation
controls. They also include the Corporation’s share of the undivided interest
in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Amounts representing the Corporation’s interest in
entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant
influence, are included in “Investments, advances and long-term receivables.”
The Corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in the
Consolidated Statement of Income caption “Income from equity affiliates.”

Majority ownership is normally the indicator of
control that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated. However,
certain factors may indicate that a majority-owned investment is not controlled
and therefore should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
These factors occur where the minority shareholders are granted by law or by
contract substantive participating rights. These include the right to approve
operating policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and
management compensation and succession plans.

The Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign
exchange translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income.

Evidence of loss in value that might indicate
impairment of investments in companies accounted for on the equity method is
assessed to determine if such evidence represents a loss in value of the
Corporation’s investment that is other than temporary. Examples of key
indicators include a history of operating losses, a negative earnings and cash
flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the
financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment or
geographic region. If evidence of an other than temporary loss in fair value
below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is recognized. In the
absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash flows are used to
assess fair value.

Revenue
Recognition.

The Corporation
generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical products
under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. In some cases (e.g.,
natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic
price adjustments. Revenues are recognized when the products are delivered,
which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and
rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured.

Revenues from the production of natural gas properties
in which the Corporation has an interest with other producers are recognized on
the basis of the Corporation’s net working interest. Differences between actual
production and net working interest volumes are not significant.

Purchases and sales of inventory with the same
counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined
and recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold.

Sales-Based
Taxes.

The Corporation reports sales,
excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions on a gross basis in the
Consolidated Statement of Income (included in both revenues and costs).

Derivative
Instruments.

The Corporation makes
limited use of derivative instruments. The Corporation does not engage in
speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities, nor does it
use derivatives with leveraged features. When the Corporation does enter into derivative
transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from existing assets,
liabilities and forecasted transactions.

The gains and losses resulting from changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded in income. In some cases, the
Corporation designates derivatives as fair value hedges, in which case the
gains and losses are offset in income by the gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item.

Fair
Value.

Fair value is the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3
are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value. Hierarchy Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that
are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy
Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market

.

Inventories.

Crude oil, products and merchandise
inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally
determined under the last-in, first-out method – LIFO). Inventory costs include
expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and indirectly
incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location.
Selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are reported as period
costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies
are valued at cost or less.

Property,
Plant and Equipment.

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the
asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or
the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking
obsolescence into consideration. Maintenance and repairs, including planned
major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements
are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.

Interest costs incurred to finance expenditures during
the construction phase of multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the
historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. The project construction
phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and
ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized
interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are
depreciated over the service life of the related assets.

The Corporation uses the “successful efforts” method
to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this method,
costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis with certain exploratory
expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred. Costs of
productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the
unit-of-production method.

The Corporation carries as an asset exploratory well
costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its
completion as a producing well and where the Corporation is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to
expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual
lease rentals, are expensed as incurred.

Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized
using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil
and gas reserves.

Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs
associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using
unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of
oil, gas and other minerals that are estimated to be recoverable from existing
facilities using current operating methods.

Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas
volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at
custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease
or field storage tank.

Production involves lifting the oil and gas to the
surface and gathering, treating, field processing and field storage of the oil
and gas. The production function normally terminates at the outlet valve on the
lease or field production storage tank. Production costs are those incurred to
operate and maintain the Corporation’s wells and related equipment and
facilities and are expensed as incurred. They become part of the cost of oil
and gas produced. These costs, sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include
such items as labor costs to operate the wells and related equipment; repair
and maintenance costs on the wells and equipment; materials, supplies and
energy costs required to operate the wells and related equipment; and
administrative expenses related to the production activity.

Proved oil and gas properties held and used by the
Corporation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Assets
are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.

The Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash
flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying
amounts. Cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using annually
updated corporate plan investment evaluation assumptions for crude oil
commodity prices, refining and chemical margins and foreign currency exchange
rates. Annual volumes are based on field production profiles, which are also
updated annually. Prices for natural gas and other products are based on
corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and also for
investment evaluation purposes. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing
exclude derivative instruments.

Impairment analyses are generally based on proved
reserves. Where probable reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount
of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation. An asset group
would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying
value.  Impairments are measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds fair
value.

Significant unproved properties are assessed for
impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs
are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length
of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that
are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based
on development risk and average holding period. The valuation allowances are
reviewed at least annually.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Gains on sales of proved
and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty
about the recovery of costs applicable to any interest retained nor any
substantial obligation for future performance by the Corporation.

Losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred
or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties
is less than the carrying value.

Asset
Retirement Obligations and Environmental Liabilities.

The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for
certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as
liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets
are installed. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as
part of the related assets and depreciated. Over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value.

Liabilities for environmental costs are recorded when
it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries
from third parties and projected cash expenditures are not discounted.

Foreign
Currency Translation.

The Corporation
selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries
based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each
subsidiary operates.

Downstream and Chemical operations primarily use the
local currency. However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history of
high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and Singapore, which predominantly
sells into the U.S. dollar export market. Upstream operations which are
relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country, such as
Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway and continental Europe, use the local
currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S.
dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into
U.S. dollar-denominated markets.

For all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring
foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in
income.

Stock-Based
Payments.

The Corporation awards
stock-based compensation to employees in the form of restricted stock and
restricted stock units. Compensation expense is measured by the price of the stock
at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service
period. See Note 15, Incentive Program, for further details.

2. Accounting Changes

The
Corporation did not adopt authoritative guidance in 2013 that had a material
impact on the Corporation’s financial statements.

3. Miscellaneous Financial Information

Research
and development expenses totaled $1,044 million in 2013, $1,042 million in 2012
and $1,044 million in 2011.

Net income included before-tax aggregate foreign
exchange transaction gains of $155 million and $159 million, and losses of $184
million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

In 2013, 2012 and 2011, net income included gains of $282
million, $328 million and $292 million, respectively, attributable to the
combined effects of LIFO inventory accumulations and drawdowns. The aggregate
replacement cost of inventories was estimated to exceed their LIFO carrying
values by $21.2 billion and $21.3 billion at December 31, 2013, and 2012,
respectively.

5. Cash Flow
Information

The
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides information about changes in cash
and cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents.

The “Net (gain) on asset sales” in net cash provided
by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes
before-tax gains from the sale of a partial interest in Iraq, the sale of
Downstream affiliates in the Caribbean and the sale of service stations in
2013; the Japan restructuring, the sale of an Upstream property in Angola, exchanges
of Upstream  properties, the sale of U.S. service stations, and the sale of the
Downstream affiliates in Malaysia and Switzerland in 2012; and from the sale of
some Upstream Canadian, U.K. and other producing properties and assets, and the
sale of U.S. service stations in 2011.  These gains are reported in “Other
income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

In 2012, the Corporation’s interest in a cost company
was redeemed.  As part of the redemption, a variable note due in 2035 issued by
Mobil Services (Bahamas) Ltd. was assigned to a consolidated ExxonMobil
affiliate.  This note is no longer classified as third party long-term debt. 
This assignment did not result in a “Reduction in long-term debt” on the
Statement of Cash Flows.

In 2012, ExxonMobil completed asset exchanges,
primarily noncash transactions, of approximately $1 billion.  This amount is
not included in the “Sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant
and equipment” or the “Additions to property, plant and equipment” lines on the
Statement of Cash Flows.

In 2011, included in “Proceeds associated with sales
of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of
investments” is a $3.6 billion deposit for an asset that was sold in 2012.

The
Corporation has short-term committed lines of credit of $5.9 billion which were
unused as of December 31, 2013.  The majority of these lines are available for
general corporate purposes, however $0.5 billion has been designated as
specifically supporting commercial paper programs. The weighted-average
interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.4 percent and 1.7
percent at December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

7. Equity Company
Information

The
summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain
less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where
minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions (see Note 1).  These companies are primarily engaged in
oil and gas exploration and production, natural gas marketing and refining
operations in North America; natural gas exploration, production and
distribution, and downstream operations in Europe; and research, exploration,
production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, refining operations,
petrochemical manufacturing, fuel sales and power generation in Asia. Also
included are several refining, petrochemical manufacturing and marketing
ventures.

The Corporation’s ownership in these ventures is
in the form of shares in corporate joint ventures as well as interests in
partnerships. Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity
investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are
assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on
the company’s analysis of the factors giving rise to the difference.  The
amortization of this difference, as appropriate, is included in “income from
equity affiliates.”

The share of total equity company revenues from
sales to ExxonMobil consolidated companies was 13 percent, 16 percent and 19
percent in the years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

In 2013, the Corporation and Rosneft established
various entities to conduct exploration and research activities.  Periods of
disproportionate funding will result in the Corporation recognizing, during the
early phases of the projects, an investment that is larger than its equity
share of these entities.  These joint ventures are considered Variable Interest
Entities (VIEs).  However, since the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary
of these entities the joint ventures are reported as equity companies.  The
Corporation’s maximum exposure to loss from these joint ventures is limited to
its investment of $0.1 billion and firm commitments of $1.1 billion at December
31, 2013.

In the
Upstream segment, depreciation is generally on a unit-of-production basis, so
depreciable life will vary by field. In the Downstream segment, investments in
refinery and lubes basestock manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated
on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life and service station buildings and
fixed improvements over a 20-year life. In the Chemical segment, investments in
process equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a
20-year life.

Accumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $190,867
million at the end of 2013 and $182,365 million at the end of 2012. Interest
capitalized in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $309 million, $506 million and $593
million, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The
Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair
value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations
incurred in the current period were Level 3 (unobservable inputs) fair value
measurements. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as
part of the related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over
time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value.

Asset retirement obligations for downstream and
chemical facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are
permanently shut down and dismantled. These obligations may include the costs
of asset disposal and additional soil remediation. However, these sites have
indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the
fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured, since it is
impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.

The following table summarizes the
activity in the liability for asset retirement obligations:

10. Accounting for
Suspended Exploratory Well Costs

The
Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the
well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing
the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. The term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.

The following two tables provide details of the
changes in the balance of suspended exploratory well costs as well as an aging
summary of those costs.

13. Financial
Instruments and Derivatives

Financial Instruments.

The fair value of financial instruments is determined
by reference to observable market data and other valuation techniques as
appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the difference
between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term debt. The
estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease
obligations, was $6.8 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2013, and 2012,
respectively, as compared to recorded book values of $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion
at December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

The fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at December 31, 2013, is: Level 1 $5,756 million; Level 2 $967
million; and Level 3 $64 million.  Level 1 represents quoted prices in active
markets.  Level 2 includes debt whose fair value is based upon a publicly
available index.  Level 3 involves using internal data augmented by relevant
market indicators if available.

Derivative
Instruments.

The Corporation’s size,
strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of
the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s
enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity
prices. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of derivatives to
mitigate the impact of such changes. The Corporation does not engage in
speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities nor does it
use derivatives with leveraged features. When the Corporation does enter into
derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from
existing assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions.

The estimated fair value of derivative instruments
outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet was a net asset of $1 million at
year-end 2013 and a net asset of $2 million at year-end 2012. Assets and
liabilities associated with derivatives are usually recorded either in “Other
current assets” or “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.”

The Corporation’s fair value measurement of its
derivative instruments use either Level 1 (observable quoted prices on active
exchanges) or Level 2 (derivatives that are determined by either market prices
on an active market for similar assets or by prices quoted by a broker or other
market-corroborated prices) inputs.

The Corporation recognized a before-tax gain or (loss)
related to derivative instruments of $(7) million, $(23) million and $131 million
during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Income statement effects associated
with derivatives are usually recorded either in “Sales and other operating
revenue” or “Crude oil and product purchases.”

The Corporation believes there are no material market
or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations
or liquidity as a result of the derivative activities described above.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14. Long-Term Debt

At
December 31, 2013, long-term debt consisted of $6,542 million due
in U.S. dollars and $349 million representing the U.S. dollar equivalent
at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. These
amounts exclude that portion of long-term debt, totaling $1,034 million, which
matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. The amounts of
long-term debt maturing in each of the four years after December 31, 2014,
in millions of dollars, are: 2015 – $782; 2016 – $513; 2017 – $857;
and 2018 – $900.

15. Incentive Program

The 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of
stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and other
forms of award. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation
and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned. Outstanding awards are subject
to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument.
Options and SARs may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market
value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The maximum
number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program
is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited, expire or are settled in cash, do
not count against this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have
a specified term. New awards may be made until the available shares are
depleted, unless the Board terminates the plan early. At the end of 2013,
remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 117

million.

Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

Awards
totaling 9,729 thousand, 10,017 thousand, and 10,533 thousand of
restricted (nonvested) common stock and restricted (nonvested) common stock
units were granted in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Compensation expense
for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is
recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these awards
are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash
are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over
the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and
units may not be sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The
majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the
shares and units in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50
percent vesting after seven years. Awards granted to a small number of senior
executives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and
of 10 years or retirement, whichever occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent
of the award.

The Corporation has purchased shares in the open
market and through negotiated transactions to offset shares issued in
conjunction with benefit plans and programs. Purchases may be discontinued at
any time without prior notice.

restricted stock and restricted stock units for the year ended

As of
December 31, 2013, there was $2,269 million of unrecognized compensation
cost related to the nonvested restricted awards. This cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.5 years. The compensation cost
charged against income for the restricted stock and restricted stock units was
$854 million, $854 million and $793 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The income tax benefit recognized in income related to this compensation
expense was $78 million, $79 million and $73 million for the same periods,
respectively. The fair value of shares and units vested in 2013, 2012 and 2011
was $1,040 million, $926 million and $801 million, respectively. Cash payments
of $67 million, $66 million and $46 million for vested restricted stock units
settled in cash were made in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Stock
Options.

The Corporation has not
granted any stock options under the 2003 Incentive Program and all stock
options granted under the prior program were exercised by the end of 2011. In
2010, the Corporation granted 12,393 thousand of converted XTO stock options of
which 1,506 thousand stock options, with an average exercise price of $85.57,
were outstanding as of December 31, 2013.

16. Litigation and
Other Contingencies

Litigation.

A variety of claims have been made
against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of
pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates
from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.

Other
Contingencies.

The Corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December
31, 2013, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under
contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar
matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate
of the maximum potential exposure.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In
accordance with a nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in
February 2007, by May 1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil
Company (PdVSA) assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project.
This Project had been operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a
41.67 percent ownership interest in the Project. The decree also required
conversion of the Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase
in PdVSA’s or one of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with
the stipulation that if ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation
of the mixed enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would
“directly assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil
refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27,
2007, the government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the
Cerro Negro Project. ExxonMobil’s remaining net book investment in Cerro Negro
producing assets is about $750 million.

On September 6, 2007, affiliates of ExxonMobil filed a
Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID) invoking ICSID jurisdiction under Venezuela’s
Investment Law and the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. The
ICSID Tribunal issued a decision on June 10, 2010, finding that it had
jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral
Investment Treaty. The ICSID arbitration proceeding is continuing and a hearing
on the merits was held in February 2012. At this time, the net impact of these
matters on the Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be
reasonably estimated. Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the
resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or
financial condition.

An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors
under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of
Nigeria. ExxonMobil’s affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a
56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with
NNPC regarding NNPC’s lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under
the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the
Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian
Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member
arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors’ position in all
material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount
of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The
Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award,
and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside.

On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the
award.  The Contractors have appealed that judgment.

In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit
against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their
ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. At this time,
the net impact of this matter on the Corporation’s consolidated financial
results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome
of enforcement proceedings, the Corporation does not expect the proceedings to
have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial
condition.

For
2013 and 2012, other postretirement benefits paid are net of $20 million and $23
million of Medicare subsidy receipts, respectively.

For
selection of the discount rate for U.S. plans, several sources of information
are considered, including interest rate market indicators and the discount rate
determined by constructing a portfolio of high-quality, noncallable bonds with
cash flows that match estimated outflows for benefit payments.  For major
non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is determined by using bond portfolios
with an average maturity approximating that of the liabilities or spot yield
curves, both of which are constructed using high-quality,
local-currency-denominated bonds.

The measurement of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.5
percent in 2015 and subsequent years. A one-percentage-point increase in
the health care cost trend rate would increase service and interest cost
by $68 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by $734 million. A
one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rate would decrease
service and interest cost by $53 million and the postretirement benefit
obligation by $597 million.

The
funding levels of all qualified pension plans are in compliance
with standards set by applicable law or regulation. As shown in the table
below, certain smaller U.S. pension plans and a number of non-U.S. pension
plans are not funded because local tax conventions and regulatory
practices do not encourage funding of these plans. All defined benefit pension
obligations, regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are
fully supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the
respective sponsoring affiliate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
long-term expected rate of return on funded assets shown below is established
for each benefit plan by developing a forward-looking, long-term return
assumption for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the
expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single,
long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the
target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for
each asset class.

The
Corporation’s investment strategy for benefit plan assets reflects
a long-term view, a careful assessment of the risks inherent in various
asset classes and broad diversification to reduce the risk of the portfolio.
The benefit plan assets are primarily invested in passive equity and
fixed income index funds to diversify risk while minimizing costs. The
equity funds hold ExxonMobil stock only to the extent necessary to replicate
the relevant equity index. The fixed income funds are largely invested in high-quality
corporate and government debt securities.

Studies are periodically conducted to establish the
preferred target asset allocation percentages. The target asset allocation for
the U.S. benefit plans is 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent debt
securities. The target asset allocation for the non-U.S. plans in aggregate is 49
percent equity securities and 51 percent debt securities. The equity targets
for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans include an allocation to private equity
partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage venture capital of 5 percent
and 3 percent, respectively.

The fair value measurement levels are accounting terms
that refer to different methods of valuing assets. The terms do not represent
the relative risk or credit quality of an investment.

of the securities owned by the funds is based on observable quoted prices on
active exchanges, which are Level 1 inputs.

(2)   For non-U.S. equity securities
held in separate accounts, fair value is based on observable quoted prices on
active exchanges.

(3)   For private equity, fair value
is generally established by using revenue or earnings multiples or other
relevant market data including Initial Public Offerings.

(4)   For corporate, government and
asset-backed debt securities, fair value is based on observable inputs of
comparable market transactions.

(5)   For corporate and government
debt securities that are traded on active exchanges, fair value is based on
observable quoted prices.

(6)   For real estate funds, fair
value is based on appraised values developed using comparable market
transactions.

Disclosures about Segments and Related Information

The
Upstream, Downstream and Chemical functions best define the operating segments
of the business that are reported separately. The factors used to identify
these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are
undertaken by each segment. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to
explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream segment is
organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. The Chemical
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. These
segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical
industries.

These functions have been defined as the operating
segments of the Corporation because they are the segments (1) that engage
in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are
incurred; (2) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the
Corporation’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources
to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and (3) for
which discrete financial information is available.

Earnings after income tax include transfers at
estimated market prices.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In corporate and financing
activities, interest revenue relates to interest earned on cash deposits and
marketable securities. Interest expense includes non-debt-related interest
expense of $202 million and $165 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. For
2013, non-debt-related interest expense was a net credit of $123 million,
primarily reflecting the effect of credits from the favorable resolution of
prior year tax positions.

The
Corporation had $47 billion of indefinitely reinvested, undistributed
earnings from subsidiary companies outside the U.S. Unrecognized deferred taxes
on remittance of these funds are not expected to be material.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Unrecognized Tax Benefits.

The Corporation is subject to income taxation in many
jurisdictions around the world. Unrecognized tax benefits reflect the
difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax
returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements. Resolution of
the related tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax
authorities or through litigation will take many years to complete. It is
difficult to predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such
timing is not entirely within the control of the Corporation. It is reasonably
possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase by up
to 20 percent in the next 12 months, with no material impact on near-term
earnings. Given the long time periods involved in resolving tax positions, the
Corporation does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits
will have a material impact on the Corporation’s effective income tax rate in
any given year.

The following table summarizes the movement in
unrecognized tax benefits.

The
additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown above include
effects related to net income and equity, and timing differences for which the
ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty
about the timing of such deductibility. The 2013, 2012 and 2011 changes in
unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Corporation’s
net income or cash flow.

years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction:

The
Corporation classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest
expense or interest income and classifies tax-related penalties as operating
expense.

For 2013, the Corporation’s net interest expense was a
credit of $207 million, reflecting the effect of credits from the favorable
resolution of prior year tax positions. The Corporation incurred $46 million and
$62 million in interest expense on income tax reserves in 2012 and 2011,
respectively. The related interest payable balances were $156 million and $385
million at December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs

The amounts shown for net capitalized costs of
consolidated subsidiaries are $13,667 million less at year-end 2013 and $10,643
million less at year-end 2012 than the amounts reported as investments in
property, plant and equipment for the Upstream in Note 9. This is due
to the exclusion from capitalized costs of certain transportation and
research assets and assets relating to LNG operations. Assets related to oil
sands and oil shale mining operations are included in the capitalized costs in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board rules.

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs
(continued)

The
amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs
charged to expense during the year. Costs incurred also include new asset
retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or
decreases to the asset retirement obligation resulting from changes in cost
estimates or abandonment date. Total consolidated costs incurred in 2013 were $33,623
million, up $2,477 million from 2012, due primarily to higher property
acquisition costs partially offset by lower exploration costs. 2012 costs were $31,146
million, up $392 million from 2011, due primarily to higher exploration and
development costs partially offset by lower property acquisition costs. Total
equity company costs incurred in 2013 were $2,342 million, up $938 million from
2012, due primarily to higher exploration and development costs.

Oil and Gas Reserves

The following information describes changes during the
years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2011, 2012, and
2013.

The definitions used are in accordance with the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of
oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a
given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods and government regulations – prior to the time at
which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence
indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new
investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to
recover these proved reserves.

In accordance with the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules, the year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves
change categories shown in the following tables were calculated using average
prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period
covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves
quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates
and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flow.

Revisions can include upward or downward changes in
previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the
evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir
or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or
(3) changes in average prices and year-end costs that are used in the estimation
of reserves. This category can also include significant changes in either
development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.

Proved reserves include 100 percent of each
majority-owned affiliate’s participation in proved reserves and ExxonMobil’s
ownership percentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude
royalties and quantities due others. Gas reserves exclude the gaseous
equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the gas on leases, at field
facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net
proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.

In the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves
and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation
does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from
consolidated companies.

Reserves reported under production sharing and other
nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by
the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves that we
report for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and
gas price changes. As oil and gas prices increase, the cash flow and value
received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves
required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher
prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The
percentage of total liquids and natural gas proved reserves (consolidated
subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2013 that were associated with
production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent of liquids, 9 percent
of natural gas and 10 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (gas converted to
oil-equivalent at 6 billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels).

Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that
are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively
minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are
those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required for recompletion.

Crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas
production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil’s oil
and gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of gas
delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Operating Summary
due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.

The changes between 2012 year-end proved reserves and
2013 year-end proved reserves reflect the extensions and discoveries in the
United States and the Middle East.

Standardized Measure of Discounted
Future Cash Flows

As required by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices,
year-end costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10
percent to net proved reserves. The standardized measure includes costs
for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations.
The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected future cash flows to be
obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or
of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. The standardized measure is
prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including
first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time
and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year
as prices change.
