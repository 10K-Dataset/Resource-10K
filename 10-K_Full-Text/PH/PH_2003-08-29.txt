$17,143,000.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses

The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its
products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. In addition, patent applications on certain products are now pending, although there can be no assurance that patents will be issued. The Company is not dependent to
any material extent on any single patent or group of patents.

Backlog
and Seasonal Nature of Business

The Company’s
backlog at June 30, 2003 was approximately $1,803,091,000 and at June 30, 2002 was approximately $1,862,992,000. Approximately 81% of the Company’s backlog at June 30, 2003 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. The
Company’s business generally is not seasonal in nature.

-5-

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate
the discharge of materials into the environment. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject to the federal “Superfund” law, under which the Company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” and may be
liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund priority list.

As of June 30, 2003, the Company is involved in environmental remediation at 24 manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and
has been named as a “potentially responsible party,” along with other companies, at three off-site waste disposal facilities and two regional Superfund sites.

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations
has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.

As of June 30, 2003, the Company has a reserve of $15,282,000 for environmental matters which are probable and reasonably
estimable. This reserve is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities
and the amount of the Company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties.

The Company’s estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of $15,282,000 to a maximum of $44,177,000. The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final
delineation of contamination, final determination of remedial action required, negotiations with federal and state agencies with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technology,
effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ultimate ability to pay of the other responsible parties, and any insurance or third party recoveries.

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

The Company’s primary energy source for each of its business segments is electric power. While the Company cannot predict future costs of such
electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power will be coal from substantial, proven coal reserves available to electric utilities. The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies
both in the United States and elsewhere. To date the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments.

-6-

Steel, brass, aluminum, elastomeric materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used by the
Company. These materials are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 46,787 persons as of June 30, 2003, of whom approximately 19,899 were employed by foreign subsidiaries.

ITEM 7A

.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

. The Company enters into forward exchange contracts,
costless collar contracts and cross-currency swap agreements to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in related foreign currencies. The total value of open contracts and

-16-

any risk to the Company as a result of these arrangements is not material to the Company’s financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

The Company’s debt
portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company’s objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near term
interest rates. The Company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a $200 million notional principal amount. The swap agreement converts a portion of the Company’s variable rate debt to a fixed rate through 2004. The agreement is
with a major financial institution and the risk of loss is considered remote. The carrying and fair value of this agreement is not material to the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. A one hundred basis point
increase in near term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt by approximately $3.0 million.

The Company periodically conducts an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer as well as the Company’s Audit Committee and independent auditors, of its internal controls and procedures. Other than a strengthening of pricing oversight controls, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal
controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the Company’s internal controls subsequent to the date of the most recent evaluation.
