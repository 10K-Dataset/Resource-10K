Competition

The Company’s business operates in highly competitive markets and industries. The Company offers hundreds of thousands of individual
products over numerous, varied markets through its 132 reporting units operating in 46 countries and consequently has thousands of competitors when viewed across the various markets and product offerings. The Company’s competitors include many
large U.S. and non-U.S. companies, divisions of larger companies, and smaller regional or specialized companies. The degree of competition varies globally and regionally by product line, end market and geographic location. While each of the
Company’s segments has several global competitors and numerous regional and specialized local ones, given the Company’s market and product breadth, no single competitor competes with the Company with respect to all products manufactured
and sold by the Company.

- 7 -

In the Industrial Segment, the Company competes on the basis of product quality and
innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. The Company believes that it is one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for its most significant Industrial Segment products. While
the Company’s primary global competitors include SMC Corporation, Freudenberg-NOK, Festo AG, Bosch Rexroth AG, Swagelok Company, Pall Corporation, Donaldson Company, Inc. and Eaton Corporation, none of these companies compete with every Group
and every product line that make up the Company’s Industrial Segment.

In the Aerospace Segment, the Company has
developed alliances with key customers based on the Company’s advanced technological and engineering capabilities, superior performance in quality, delivery, and service, and price competitiveness, which has enabled the Company to obtain
significant original equipment business on new aircraft programs for its systems and components and to thereby obtain the follow-on repair and replacement business for these programs. Although the Company believes that it is one of the market
leaders in most of the major markets for its most significant Aerospace Segment products, the Company’s primary global competitors for the most significant Aerospace Segment products include Honeywell Inc., Goodrich Corporation, Hamilton
Sundstrand (a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.), GE Aviation (formerly Smiths Aerospace), Eaton Corporation, Moog Inc., Woodwood Governor Company and Zodiac Aerospace SA.

In the Climate & Industrial Controls Segment, the Company competes on the basis of product quality and innovation, customer
service, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. Although the Company believes that it is one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for its most significant Climate & Industrial Controls Segment
products, the Company’s primary global competitors for the most significant Climate & Industrial Controls segment products include Danfoss A/S, Emerson Climate Technologies, Emerson/ASCO, Hutchinson SA, TI Automotive Ltd. and Visteon
Corporation.

The Company believes that its platform utilizing nine core technologies which include aerospace,
electromechanical, filtration, fluid handling, hydraulics, pneumatics, process control, refrigeration, and sealing and shielding is a positive factor in its ability to compete effectively with both large and small competitors. For each of its
segments, the Company believes that the following factors also contribute to its ability to compete effectively:

•

decentralized operating structure that allows each division to focus on its customers and respond quickly at the local level;

•

system solution capabilities that use the Company’s core technologies from a variety of its segments; and

•

global presence.

Research and Product Development

The Company continually researches the feasibility of new products and services through its development laboratories and testing
facilities in many of its worldwide manufacturing locations. Its research and product development staff includes chemists, physicists, and mechanical, chemical and electrical engineers.

- 8 -

Total research and development costs relating to the development of new products and
services and the improvement of existing products and services amounted to $316,181,141 in fiscal year 2010, $338,907,820 in fiscal year 2009, and $303,097,752 in fiscal year 2008. These amounts include costs incurred by the Company related to
independent research and development initiatives as well as costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts. Costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts and included in the total research and development
costs reported above for each of the respective fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $40,276,911, $50,739,381, and $47,757,134, respectively.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses

The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use a
number of patents owned by others. In addition, patent applications on certain products are now pending, although there can be no assurance that patents will be issued. The Company is not dependent to any material extent on any single patent or
group of patents.

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business

The Company’s backlog by business segment for the past two fiscal years, as set forth on pages 13-5 to 13-7 of Exhibit 13 to this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, is incorporated into this section by reference. The Company’s backlog at June 30, 2010 was $3,141,244,079 and at June 30, 2009 was $2,885,284,015. Approximately 85% of the Company’s backlog at
June 30, 2010 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. The Company’s business generally is not seasonal in nature.

Environmental Regulation

The Company’s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, the Company is subject to United
States federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as foreign laws designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for
non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposures to, hazardous materials. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject
to the United States federal “Superfund” law, under which the Company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the
United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list.

As of June 30, 2010, the Company is
involved in environmental remediation at various United States and foreign manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and has been named as a “potentially responsible party,” along with other companies, at
off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites.

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are
properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management of efforts and expenditures by the
Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.

- 9 -

As of June 30, 2010, the Company had a reserve of $15,825,492 for environmental matters
which are probable and reasonably estimable. This reserve is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions
required by governmental authorities and the amount of the Company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties.

The Company’s estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of $15,825,492 to a maximum of
$72,342,781. The largest range of the estimated total liability for any one site is approximately $6,100,000. The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final determination of contamination, final determination of remedial
action required, negotiations with federal and state agencies with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of
the other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or third-party recoveries.

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw
Materials

The Company’s primary energy source for each of its business segments is electric power. While the
Company cannot predict future costs of such electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power will be coal from substantial, proven coal reserves available to electric utilities. The Company is subject to governmental
regulations in regard to energy supplies in the United States and elsewhere. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments.

Steel, brass, aluminum, elastomeric and thermoplastic materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used by the Company. These
materials are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 54,800 persons as of June 30, 2010, of whom approximately 28,900 were employed
by foreign subsidiaries.

Business Segment Information

The Company’s net sales, segment operating income and assets by business segment and net sales and long-lived assets by geographic
area for the past three fiscal years, as set forth on pages 13-15 to 13-16 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are incorporated into this section by reference.

- 10 -

Acquisitions

During fiscal year 2010, the Company completed one acquisition, as set forth on page 13-22 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form
10-K, which is incorporated into this section by reference.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

.

The following “risk factors” identify what the Company believes to be all of the risks that could materially and adversely
affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company is subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions.

Current uncertainty regarding global economic conditions and the existence and rate of any economic recovery may have an adverse effect on
the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the Company and its distributors, customers
and suppliers operate. Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation,
interest rates and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Company’s distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the
Company’s revenues, operating profits and margins and order rates.

During the second half of fiscal 2010, the Company
began to see signs of an economic recovery. Throughout the worldwide economic downturn, the Company focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet
and managing its cash. The Company’s Win Strategy initiatives relating to growth and margin improvement as well as the implementation of a number of business realignment initiatives, including plant closures and general workforce reductions,
continue to help meet this objective. There can be no assurance, however, that these or any other initiatives or contingency plans implemented by the Company will be successful or that the Company will have sufficient resources to manage the
recovery if the economy rebounds more quickly than anticipated.

The Company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide
economic conditions will improve. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company’s control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.

- 11 -

The Company is subject to risks relating to its information technology systems.

The Company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business. If these systems are damaged or cease
to function properly and the Company suffers any interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Potential product liability risks exist from the products that the Company sells.

The Company’s businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its
products and the products of third-party vendors that the Company uses or resells. Although the Company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. In the event of a claim against it, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Moreover, even if the Company maintains adequate insurance, a successful claim could still have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
and results of operations.

The Company may be adversely affected by litigation or other regulatory proceedings.

The Company is a defendant from time to time in litigation and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. Due to the inherent
uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition
or results of operations.

The Company is subject to risks relating to organizational changes.

The Company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost
management strategies. In addition, the Company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other
organizational changes, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Demand for and supply of the
Company’s products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the Company cannot predict or control, which would adversely affect its results of operations.

Numerous factors may affect the demand for and supply of the Company’s products, including:

•

changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in
shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs;

•

changes in the market acceptance of its products;

•

increased competition in the markets it serves;

- 12 -

•

declines in the general level of industrial production; or

•

declines in the availability, or increases in the prices, of raw materials.

If any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the Company’s products could suffer, which would adversely affect its results of
operations.

The raw materials used in the Company’s production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price
and supply fluctuations that could increase the costs of products and adversely affect our results of operations.

The
Company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant
increases could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and profit margins. Although the Company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along increased raw material prices to its customers
in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the Company’s ability to increase the price of its products, or the Company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to
pricing pressure, sales contracts or other factors.

The Company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and
quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. As a result, the Company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. Consequently,
the Company’s results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

The Company may face various
risks relating to acquisitions, including limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.

The Company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it
believes will enhance its operations and profitability. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. In
addition, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities, that the Company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any
acquired businesses will be profitable. The successful integration of new businesses depends on the Company’s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. If the Company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The Company operates in a highly competitive environment.

The Company’s domestic and foreign operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global and local competitors, which
could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the Company’s margins or market shares. To compete successfully, the Company’s Industrial Segment and

The Company is subject to risks relating to its foreign operations.

The Company’s net sales derived from customers outside the United States were approximately 45% in fiscal 2010, 44% in fiscal 2009
and 47% in fiscal 2008. In addition, many of the Company’s manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States. The Company expects net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its
total net sales. The Company’s foreign operations are subject to risk in addition to those risks of its domestic operations, including:

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;

•

transportation delays and interruptions;

•

political, social and economic instability and disruptions;

•

government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;

•

the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

import and export controls;

•

labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;

•

the potential for nationalization of enterprises;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;

•

limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences; and

•

difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis.

If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations
internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

Changes in the Company’s tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities
are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation
allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-United States authorities. If these audits result in
assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company’s tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

- 14 -

The Obama administration has proposed legislation that would change how U.S. multinational
corporations are taxed on their foreign income. If such legislation is enacted, the Company’s effective tax rate and, in turn, the Company’s profitability, could be materially impacted.

The Company’s future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies.

The markets the Company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and
services. The Company’s ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development or
production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Company’s competitive position.

The Company’s future growth is partly dependent on the preservation of its intellectual property.

Protecting the Company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents,
trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. The Company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the Company may be unable to
maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. In addition, the global nature of the Company’s business could present increased risks that the Company’s
intellectual property will be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the United States. In such case, the Company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited,
particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. Unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property rights or
inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company’s competitive position and results of operations.

The Company may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject.

The Company’s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various United
States federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as foreign laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for
non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. Among other laws, the Company is subject to the
United States federal “Superfund” law, under which it has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States
Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list. The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the Superfund law.

- 15 -

In addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent
legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a “cap-and-trade” system in the United States. Changes in or to regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate
change concerns could subject the Company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. While such regulation appears likely in the United States, until definitive regulations are adopted, the Company is
not able to predict how such regulations would affect the Company’s business, operations or financial results.

The
Company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. If more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the Company’s results of
operations.

The amount of expenses recorded for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes
in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase
expenses and may adversely impact the Company’s future results of operations.

The Company does business with the United States
government and as such is subject to government regulations.

In addition to the risks identified herein, doing business
with the United States government subjects the Company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. Agreements relating to the sale of products to
government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the Company’s failure to perform under the applicable contract. The Company is subject to government investigations
of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If the Company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Properties

. The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in Cleveland, Ohio and, at
June 30, 2010, the Company had 304 manufacturing plants and 286 distribution centers and sales and administrative offices throughout the world, none of which were individually material to its operations. The facilities are situated in 39 states
within the United States and in 45 other countries. The Company owns the majority of its manufacturing plants and distribution centers, and its leased properties primarily

- 19 -

consist of sales and administrative offices. The number of facilities used by each of the Company’s operating segments is summarized by type and geographic location in the tables below:

Several facilities are
shared among each of the Company’s operating segments. To avoid double counting, each shared facility is counted once, primarily in the Industrial Segment.

The Company believes that its properties have been adequately maintained, are in good condition generally and are suitable and adequate
for its business as presently conducted. The extent to which the Company uses its properties varies by property and from time to time. The Company believes that its restructuring efforts have brought capacity levels closer to present and anticipated
needs. Most of the Company’s manufacturing facilities remain capable of handling additional volume increases.

Legal Proceedings

.

Parker ITR S.r.l. (Parker ITR), a subsidiary acquired on January 31, 2002, has
been the subject of a number of lawsuits and regulatory investigations since April 27, 2007, when a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida issued a subpoena to Parker ITR and the Company requiring the production of documents, in
particular documents related to communications with competitors and customers related to Parker ITR’s business unit that manufactures marine hose, typically used in oil transfer. The lawsuits and investigations relate to allegations that for a
period of up to 21 years, the Parker ITR business unit that manufactures and sells marine hose conspired with competitors in unreasonable restraint of trade to artificially raise, fix, maintain or stabilize prices, rig bids and allocate markets and
customers for marine oil and gas hose in the United States and in other jurisdictions. The time period for the alleged illegal activities by Parker ITR’s marine hose business unit varies by jurisdiction. Parker ITR and the Company have
cooperated with all of the regulatory authorities investigating the activities of the Parker ITR business unit that manufactures and sells marine hose and continue to cooperate with the investigations that remain ongoing. Several of the lawsuits and
investigations have concluded. The following lawsuits and investigations remain pending or were resolved after March 31, 2010.

- 20 -

Four class action lawsuits were filed in the Southern District of Florida:

Shipyard
Supply LLC v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al.

, filed May 17, 2007;

Expro Gulf Limited v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al.

, filed June 6, 2007;

Bayside Rubber & Products, Inc. v. Trelleborg Industrie S.A., et al.

,
filed June 25, 2007;

Bayside Rubber & Products, Inc. v. Caleca, et al

., filed July 12, 2007; and one in the Southern District of New York:

Weeks Marine, Inc. v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al.

, filed July 27,
2007. On September 12, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action complaint. These lawsuits involve conduct from January 1985 to May 2007. Plaintiffs have since filed another amended consolidated complaint naming prior
owners of the Parker ITR business unit that manufactures and sells marine hose. Plaintiffs generally seek treble damages, a permanent injunction, attorneys’ fees, and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.

The Company and Parker ITR reached a settlement of the class action litigation in the United States, and the court granted final approval
of that settlement on January 13, 2010. On February 17, 2009, Parker ITR entered into a separate agreement to settle possible private causes of action outside the United States.

Brazilian competition authorities commenced their investigations on November 14, 2007. Parker ITR filed a procedural defense in
January 2008. The Brazilian competition authorities have not yet responded to Parker ITR’s filing. The Brazilian competition authorities’ investigation is ongoing and the Company and Parker ITR continue to cooperate. The Brazilian
authorities appear to be investigating the period from 1999 through May 2007. Because the Brazilian competition authorities have not yet responded to Parker ITR’s initial filing, the potential outcome of this investigation is uncertain and will
depend on the resolution of numerous issues not yet addressed at the current preliminary stage of the investigation.

On
May 15, 2007, the European Commission issued its initial Request for Information to the Company and Parker ITR. On January 28, 2009, the European Commission announced the results of its investigation of the alleged cartel activities. As
part of its decision, the European Commission found that Parker ITR infringed Article 81 of the European Commission treaty from April 1986 to May 2, 2007 and fined Parker ITR 25.61 million euros. The European Commission also determined
that the Company was jointly and severally responsible for 8.32 million euros of the total fine which related to the period from January 2002, when the Company acquired Parker ITR, to May 2, 2007, when the cartel activities ceased. Parker
ITR and the Company filed an appeal to the Court of First Instance of the European Communities on April 10, 2009.

The
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) filed a statement of claim in the Federal Court of Australia on May 29, 2009 and named Parker ITR as a respondent. Counsel for Parker ITR accepted service related to the ACCC’s
statement of claim and hearings have been held in the matter. The ACCC is investigating conduct through 2007. On December 10, 2009, Parker ITR and the ACCC presented a proposed settlement to the court which provides for a total fine of 675,000
Australian dollars, which was approved on April 13, 2010. Parker ITR has paid this fine, which, as of April 23, 2010 (date of payment), was approximately $626 thousand (based on the then-current exchange rate).

An additional related action was brought against the Company on May 25, 2010 under the False Claims Act in the Central
District of California:

The United States of America ex rel. Douglas Farrow v. Trelleborg, AB et al.

The United States declined to intervene against the Company or Parker ITR in the case. Plaintiff generally seeks treble damages, penalties
for each false claim and attorneys’ fees.

On August 16, 1990, the Company publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by the Company of up to 3.0 million shares of its
common stock. From time to time, the Board of Directors has adjusted the number of shares authorized for repurchase under this program. On January 28, 2009, the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in
the number of shares authorized for repurchase under this program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was equal to 10.0 million. Subject to this overall limitation, each fiscal year the Company
is authorized to repurchase an amount of common shares equal to the greater of 7.5 million shares or five percent of the shares outstanding as of the end of the prior fiscal year. There is no expiration date for this program.

.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

.

The Company enters into
forward exchange contracts and costless collar contracts, comprised of puts and calls, to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in both freely convertible and non-freely convertible foreign currencies. These contracts are with major financial
institutions and the risk of loss is considered remote. None of these contracts were designated as hedging instruments. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The total fair value and carrying
amount and any risk to the Company as a result of these arrangements is not material to the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

The Company considers Venezuela to be a highly inflationary economy; therefore, the United States dollar is the functional currency for
the Company’s Venezuelan operations. The effect of treating Venezuela as a highly inflationary economy did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

The Company’s debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company’s
objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt, thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on
variable rate debt by approximately $856,370.
