Competition

The Company’s business operates in highly competitive markets and industries. The Company offers its products over numerous, varied markets through its divisions operating in


countries and consequently has hundreds of competitors when viewed across its various markets and product offerings. The Company’s competitors include U.S. and non-U.S. companies.



These competitors and the degree of competition vary widely by product lines, end markets, geographic scope and/or geographic locations. Although each of the Company’s segments has numerous competitors, given the Company’s market and product breadth, no single competitor competes with the Company with respect to all products manufactured and sold by the Company.

In the Diversified Industrial Segment, the Company competes on the basis of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. The Company believes that it is one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for its most significant Diversified Industrial Segment products.  The Company has comprehensive motion and control packages for the broadest systems capabilities.  While the Company’s primary global competitors include Bosch Rexroth AG, Danaher Corporation, Danfoss A/S, Donaldson Company, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, Emerson Climate Technologies, Inc., Emerson/ASCO, Festo AG & Co., Freudenberg-NOK, Gates Corporation, IMI/Norgren, SMC Corporation, Swagelok Company, and Trelleborg AB, none of these businesses compete with every group in the Company's Diversified Industrial Segment and every product line offered by this segment.

In the Aerospace Systems Segment, the Company has developed alliances with key customers based on the Company’s advanced technological and engineering capabilities, superior performance in quality, delivery, and service, and price competitiveness, which has enabled the Company to obtain significant original equipment business on new aircraft programs for its systems and components and to thereby obtain the follow-on repair and replacement business for these programs.  Further, the Aerospace Systems Segment is able to utilize low-cost manufacturing techniques and best cost region strategies to achieve a lower cost producer status.  Although the Company believes that it is one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for its most significant Aerospace Systems Segment products, the Company’s primary global competitors for the most significant Aerospace Systems Segment products include Eaton Corporation plc, Honeywell International, Inc., Moog Inc., Triumph Group, Inc., UTC Aerospace Systems, Woodward, Inc. and Zodiac Aerospace SA.

The Company believes that its platform utilizing nine core technologies, which consist of aerospace, electromechanical, filtration, fluid handling, hydraulics, pneumatics, process control, refrigeration, and sealing and shielding, is a positive factor in its ability to compete effectively with both large and small competitors. For both of its segments, the Company believes that the following factors also contribute to its ability to compete effectively:

•

decentralized operating structure that allows each division to focus on its customers and respond quickly at the local level;

•

systems solution capabilities that use the Company’s core technologies from both of its segments;

•

global presence; and

•

a strong global distribution network.

Research and Product Development

The Company continually researches the feasibility of new products and services through its development laboratories and testing facilities in many of its worldwide manufacturing locations. Its research and product development staff includes chemists, physicists, and mechanical, chemical and electrical engineers.

Total research and development costs relating to the development of new products and services and the improvement of existing products and services amounted to

$327.9 million

in


,

$336.7 million

in


and

$359.8 million

in


. These amounts include costs incurred by the Company related to independent research and development initiatives as well as costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts. Costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts and included in the total research and development costs reported above for


,


and


were

$40.8 million

,

$65.3 million

and

$58.0 million

, respectively.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses

The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use patents and trademarks owned by others. In addition, patent and trademark applications are pending, although there can be no assurance that further patents and trademarks will be issued. The Company is not dependent to any material extent on any single patent, trademark or license or group of patents, trademarks or licenses.

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business

Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer.  The dollar



value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.  The Company's backlog by business segment for the past two years is included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.  The Company’s backlog was

$4.1 billion

at

June 30, 2018

and

$3.8 billion

at

June 30, 2017

. Approximately

89%

of the Company’s backlog at

June 30, 2018

is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. The Company’s business is generally not seasonal in nature.

Environmental Regulation

Certain of the Company’s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, the Company is subject to United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposures to, hazardous materials. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject to the United States federal "Superfund" law, under which the Company has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list.

As of

June 30, 2018

, the Company was involved in environmental remediation at various United States and non-U.S. manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and as a "potentially responsible party," along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites.

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management efforts and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.

As of

June 30, 2018

, the Company had a reserve of

$18.0 million

for environmental matters that were probable and reasonably estimable. This reserve was recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of the Company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties.

The Company’s estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of

$18.0 million

to a maximum of

$81.0 million

. The largest range of the estimated total liability for any one site is approximately

$9.5 million

. The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of the other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries.

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

The Company’s primary energy source for both of its business segments is electric power. While the Company cannot predict future costs of electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power is expected to be coal and natural gas from substantial, proven coal and natural gas reserves available to electric utilities. The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies in the United States and elsewhere. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments.

Steel, brass, copper, aluminum, nickel, rubber and thermoplastic materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used by the Company. These materials are expected to be available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company.

Employees

The Company employed approximately

57,170

persons as of

June 30, 2018

, of whom approximately

29,410

were employed by foreign subsidiaries.

Business Segment Information

The Company’s net sales, segment operating income and assets by business segment and net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area for the past three years are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.



Acquisitions

The Company made

no

acquisitions during


.  Prior-year acquisitions are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 1A.  Risk Factors

.

The following "risk factors" identify what the Company believes to be the risks that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial and/or operational performance. These risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company may be subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions.

The Company's business is sensitive to global macro-economic conditions.  Moderate economic growth persists in the economic regions in which the Company conducts substantial operations.  Future macroeconomic downturns may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on activity in many of the industries and markets in which the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. Among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other end-market activity, currency exchange rates, air travel trends, difficulties entering new markets, tariffs and governmental trade policies, and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These factors may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures, and creditworthiness of the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the Company’s revenues, operating profits, margins, and order rates.

The Company cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond the Company’s control. If these conditions deteriorate or remain at depressed levels for extended periods, however, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to its non-U.S. operations.

The Company’s net sales derived from customers outside the United States were approximately

41%

in


,

40%

in


and

41%

in


. In addition, many of the Company’s manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States. The Company expects net sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. The Company’s non-U.S. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing its domestic operations, including:

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;

•

transportation delays and interruptions;

•

political, social and economic instability and disruptions;

•

government embargoes or trade restrictions;

•

the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

import and export controls;

•

labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;

•

the potential for nationalization of enterprises;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;

•

limitations on the Company’s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences; and

•

difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis.



If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures, and risks relating to the integration of acquired companies, including risks related to the integration of CLARCOR Inc. ("Clarcor")

.

The Company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, which it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that it will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms. Furthermore, there are no assurances that the Company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities. If the Company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

In addition, the Company may not be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses or joint ventures will be profitable. Specifically, the Company is devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Clarcor with the businesses of the Company. The Company may encounter or has encountered the following difficulties during the integration process of Clarcor:

•

the consequences of a change in tax treatment, including the cost of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the Clarcor acquisition may not be realized;

•

delays in the integration of management teams, strategies, operations, products, and services;

•

differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies that may delay successful integration;

•

the ability to retain key employees;

•

the ability to create and enforce uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems;

•

challenges of integrating complex systems, technologies, networks, and other assets of Clarcor, into the Company’s, in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact or disruptions to customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies; and

•

unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration beyond current estimates.

The successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures also depend on the Company’s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. If the Company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

The Company’s results may be adversely affected if expanded operations from the acquisition of Clarcor are not effectively managed.

The Company’s acquisition of Clarcor greatly expanded the size and complexity of its business. The Company’s future success depends, in part, on the ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose or has posed substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of the expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products, and the associated costs and complexity. There can be no assurance of successful management of these matters or that the Company will realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of Clarcor.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes.

The Company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. The Company also engages in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs.  The Company further commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  The Company also cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems.

The Company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business, some of which are managed by third parties.  The security and functionality of these information technology systems, and the processing of data by these systems, are critical to our business operations.  If these systems, or any part of the systems, are damaged,



intruded upon, attacked, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents) and the Company suffers any resulting interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business or if its products are effected, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition to existing risks, any adoption or deployment of new technologies may increase our exposure to risks, breaches, or failures, which could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, the Company may have access to sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually-imposed controls. Despite the Company's use of reasonable and appropriate controls, material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming or employee errors, and/or malfeasance, could lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information, resulting in possible negative consequences, such as fines, penalties, loss of reputation or competitiveness, or other negative impacts to the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to changes in the demand for and supply of its products.

Demand for and supply of the Company’s products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the Company cannot predict or control. Such factors include:

•

changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs;

•

changes in product mix;

•

changes in the market acceptance of the Company’s products;

•

increased competition in the markets the Company serves;

•

declines in the general level of industrial production;

•

weakness in the end-markets the Company serves;

•

fluctuations in the availability or the prices of raw materials; and

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

If any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the Company’s products could suffer, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to the development of new products and technologies.

The markets in which the Company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. The Company’s ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources.  If the Company does not develop, or has difficulties or delays in the development of, innovative new and enhanced products and services, or fails to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies, the Company's revenues may be materially reduced and the Company's competitive position could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, the Company may invest in research and development of products and services, or in acquisitions or other investments, that do not lead to significant revenue, which could adversely affect our profitability.

The Company may be subject to risks arising from price and supply fluctuations in raw materials used in the Company’s production processes and by its suppliers of component parts.

The Company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Furthermore, recently implemented changes to U.S.and other countries' tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative impact on the availability and pricing of raw materials. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and profit margins. Efforts by the Company to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along price increases to its customers, may be subject to a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the Company’s ability to increase the price of its products, or the Company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors. Any such inability to manage fluctuations could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.



The Company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. As a result, the Company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. Consequently, the Company’s results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

The Company may be subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which it operates.

The Company’s operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the Company’s margins or market shares. To compete successfully, the Company must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer experience.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJ Act, was enacted into law. The TCJ Act significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, by, among other things, establishing a flat corporate U.S. income tax rate of 21 percent and creating a territorial tax system (with a one-time transition tax imposed on previously unremitted foreign earnings and profits). The Company’s future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in the Company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof (including regulations under and interpretations of the TCJ Act), the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall profitability, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or regulations. For example, the Company’s estimate of the net one-time charge incurred related to the TCJ Act could differ materially from the Company’s actual liability, due to, among other things, further refinement of the calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service, and any other actions the Company may make as a result of the TCJ Act. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the Company is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company’s tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

The Company may be subject to product liability risks.

The Company’s businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the Company uses or resells. Significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Although the Company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential significant liabilities.

The Company may be subject to risks arising from litigation, and legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations.

From time to time, the Company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. An unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  Furthermore, as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against it.  Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect the Company's assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the Company to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.

The Company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to its business and its employees.  Despite the Company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the Company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations.  Any such improper acts could damage the Company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the Company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.



The Company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property.

Protecting the Company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property in its products and services throughout the world and in the operation of its business. The Company also has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. The Company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. In addition, the global nature of the Company’s business increases the risk that the Company’s intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use or disclosure by others. In some cases, the Company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. Unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company’s intellectual property rights or the Company's inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company’s competitive position and results of operations.

The Company may be subject to risks arising from the impact of environmental regulations.

The Company’s operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-U.S. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. Among other laws, the Company is subject to the U.S. federal "Superfund" law, under which it has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list. The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the Superfund law.

In addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a "cap-and-trade" system globally.  Increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject the Company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. Until definitive regulations are adopted, the Company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the Company’s business, operations or financial results.

The Company may be subject to other more stringent environmental laws in the future. If more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits.

The funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.

The Company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees.  If healthcare costs rise significantly and the Company continues to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact the Company's future results of operations.

The Company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the United States government.

In addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the United States government subjects the Company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental acquisition regulations.  Agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the Company’s failure to perform under the applicable contract. The Company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government acquisition regulations. If the Company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, and the Company could be subject to fines or penalties associated with contract non-compliance or resulting from such investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Overview

The Company is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.

The Company's order rates provide a near-term perspective of the Company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates.  The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis.  The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders.  The Company believes the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the Company's future order rates are as follows:

•

Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activity specific to regions around the world with respect to most mobile and industrial markets;

•

Global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles for commercial aerospace markets and Department of Defense spending for military aerospace markets; and

•

Housing starts with respect to the North American residential air conditioning market and certain mobile construction markets.

A PMI above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding.  A PMI below 50 indicates the opposite.  Recent PMI levels for some regions around the world were as follows:

Global aircraft miles flown increased by approximately six percent and global revenue passenger miles increased approximately seven percent from their comparable 2017 levels.  The Company anticipates that U.S. Department of Defense spending with regards to appropriations and operations and maintenance for the U.S. Government's fiscal year 2018 will increase by approximately two percent from their fiscal 2017 level.

Housing starts in June 2018 were 11 percent lower than housing starts in March 2018 and four percent lower than housing starts in June 2017.

The Company believes many opportunities for profitable growth are available.  The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation.

The Company believes it can meet its strategic objectives by:

•

Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company;

•

Successfully executing its Win Strategy initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance;

•

Maintaining its decentralized division and sales company structure;

•

Fostering a safety first and entrepreneurial culture;

•

Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;

•

Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver;

•

Acquiring strategic businesses;

•

Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets;

•

Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and

•

Creating a culture of empowerment through its values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.



Acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the Company’s strong financial position.  In addition, the Company will continue to assess its existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the Company.  Future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the Company’s results of operations.

The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The term "year" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME

The Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance over the last three years.

Net sales

in 2018 were 18.9 percent higher than 2017.  The increase in net sales in 2018 was a result of an increase in volume in both the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations and acquisitions completed during 2017, which contributed approximately $970 million to current-year incremental net sales.  The effect of currency rate changes increased net sales in 2018 by approximately $295 million, of which $270 million was attributable to the Diversified Industrial International operations.  Net sales

in 2017 were 5.9 percent higher than 2016.  The increase in net sales in 2017 was primarily a result of acquisitions made in 2017 (which contributed approximately $558 million in sales in 2017) and an increase in volume in both the Diversified Industrial International operations and the Aerospace Systems Segment, partially offset by the effect of currency rate changes (which decreased net sales in 2017 by approximately $84 million).

Gross profit margin

(calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased in 2018 primarily due to higher margins in the Aerospace Systems Segment resulting from a favorable product mix.  All segments benefited from lower operating expenses related to simplification and realignment efforts.  These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable product mix, unfavorable raw material prices and inefficiencies created by manufacturing facility consolidations which contributed to lower margins in the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations during 2018.  Gross profit margin increased in 2017 primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative and other restructuring activities, primarily experienced in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by lower margins in the Aerospace Systems Segment.  Foreign currency transaction loss (relating to cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions) included in cost of sales for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $7.3 million, $8.1 million and $22.7 million, respectively.  Pension cost included in cost of sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $86.1 million, $135.0 million and $172.4 million, respectively.  Included in cost of sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were business realignment charges of

$44.9 million

,

$35.9 million

and

$76.2 million

, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased 14.0 percent in 2018 and increased 7.0 percent in 2017.  The increase in 2018 was primarily due to higher sales expense resulting from an increase in sales, higher amortization expense resulting from recent acquisitions and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by lower acquisition expenses.  The increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher amortization expense resulting from recent acquisitions and higher acquisition expenses, partially offset by lower expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative, lower expenses associated with the Company's deferred compensation program and lower professional services expenses. Pension cost included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $36.9 million, $65.8 million and $74.4 million, respectively.  Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were business realignment charges of

$36.8 million

,

$19.7 million

and

$21.1 million

, respectively.



Interest expense

in 2018 increased primarily due to higher weighted-average borrowings and highe

r

weighted-average interest rates.  Interest expense in 2017 increased primarily due to higher weighted-average borrowings, partially offset by lower weighted-average interest rates.

Other (income), net

in 2018, 2017 and 2016 includes $50.5 million, $42.4 million, and $25.6 million of income, respectively, related to the Company's equity interests in joint ventures. Other (income), net in 2018 also includes a writedown of an investment of $27.4 million and a loss on the sale of an investment of $13.8 million.

(Gain) on disposal of assets

includes a loss of $20 million on the sale of a business in 2018, a gain of $42 million related to the sale of a product line in 2017 and a gain of $11.5 million related to the sale of businesses in 2016.

Effective tax rate

in 2018 was higher than the comparable prior-year period primarily due to the net impact of one-time adjustments recorded as a result of the TCJ Act.  See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impact of the TCJ Act.  Excluding the impact of the TCJ Act one-time adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2018 was lower primarily due to the reduced U.S. income tax rate resulting from enactment of the TCJ Act and a net increase in discrete tax benefits, partially offset by an increase in taxes related to international activities.  The effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase of discrete tax benefits, mostly related to stock-based compensation expense.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Business Segment information presents sales, operating income and assets on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.

Diversified Industrial Segment



The Diversified Industrial Segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales:

The above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made within the prior four fiscal quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure).  The effects of acquisitions, divestitures and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.

Sales in 2018 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 25.3 percent from 2017 as compared to increasing 8.3 percent from 2016 to 2017.  Acquisitions completed during 2017 contributed approximately $798 million in incremental sales in 2018, and the effect of currency exchange rates increased sales in 2018 by $20 million.  Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2018 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 10.1 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, cars and light trucks, heavy-duty truck, oil and gas, and general industrial machinery markets.  Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2017 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations remained flat from 2016 levels reflecting higher demand from distributors offset by lower demand from end users in the heavy-duty truck, cars and light trucks, life sciences, and oil and gas markets.

Sales in the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 20.1 percent in 2018 as compared to increasing 5.6 percent from 2016 to 2017.  Acquisitions completed in 2017 contributed approximately $173 million in incremental sales in 2018.  The effect of currency rate changes increased sales by $270 million, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, China and the United Kingdom.  Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2018 for the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 10.2 percent from 2017 levels due to higher volume in all regions. The Asia Pacific region contributed approximately 50 percent of the increase in sales due to higher demand from distributors as well as end users in the construction equipment, semiconductor and engine markets, partially offset by lower end-user demand in the telecommunications and marine markets.  Europe contributed approximately 40 percent of the increase in sales due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, mining, heavy-duty truck and engine markets, partially offset by lower end-user demand in the power generation market.  Within Latin America, higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment and heavy-duty truck markets contributed to the increase in sales.



Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 4.3 percent from 2016, primarily due to higher volume in the Asia Pacific region and Latin America, partially offset by lower volume in Europe.  Within the Asia Pacific region, higher demand was experienced from distributors as well as end users in the semiconductor, cars and light trucks, telecommunications, construction equipment and engine markets.  Within Latin America, higher demand was experienced from distributors and end-user demand in the agriculture equipment market.  Within Europe, higher demand from distributors and end-user demand in the construction equipment, forestry, and miscellaneous manufacturing markets was more than offset by lower end-user demand in the general industrial machinery, oil and gas, and marine markets.

The lower operating margins in 2018 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations were primarily due to an unfavorable product mix, unfavorable raw material prices, higher amortization expense and inefficiencies created by manufacturing facility consolidations, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volume and lower operating expenses resulting from prior-year restructuring activities and the Company's simplification initiative.  The increase in operating margins in 2018 for the Diversified Industrial International operations was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring activities and the Company's simplification initiative, partially offset by higher amortization expense, inefficiencies created by manufacturing facility consolidations and an unfavorable product mix.

The increase in operating margins in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations was primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative and other restructuring activities, resulting in manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by higher acquisition-related expenses and higher amortization expense.  The increase in operating margins in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial International operations was primarily due to the higher sales volume, lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring activities and the Company's simplification initiative, resulting in manufacturing efficiencies.

The following business realignment charges and acquisition integration costs are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income:

The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance and plant closure costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, which is being implemented by its operating units throughout the world.  The majority of the Diversified Industrial International business realignment charges were incurred in Europe.  In addition to the business realignment charges presented in the table above, the Company recognized $12 million of expense associated with enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure during 2016.  The Company anticipates that cost savings realized from the work force reduction measures taken during 2018 will increase 2019 operating income by approximately three percent in both the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations.  In 2019, the Company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment, including the continued integration of 2017 acquisitions.  Such actions are expected to result in approximately $35 million in charges in 2019.

The Company anticipates Diversified Industrial North American sales for 2019 will increase between 2.6 and 5.6 percent from the 2018 level and Diversified Industrial International sales for 2019 will range between a 2.5 percent decrease and 0.5 percent increase from the 2018 level.  Diversified Industrial North American operating margins in 2019 are expected to range from 16.4 to 17.2 percent and Diversified Industrial International margins are expected to range from 15.3 to 15.7 percent.

The increase in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2018 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the Asia Pacific region and North America, with the Asia Pacific region accounting for approximately 60 percent of the increase and North America accounting for approximately 40 percent of the increase.  The increase in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2017 was primarily due to recent acquisitions as well as orders exceeding shipments in all regions, with North America and Europe each accounting for approximately 40 percent of the increase.  Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer.  The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.



Diversified Industrial Segment assets in 2018 remained flat as compared to the 2017 balance.  At June 30, 2018, increases in cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable were offset by a decrease in intangible assets.  The increase in total Diversified Industrial Segment assets in 2017 was primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by the effect of currency rate fluctuations.

Aerospace Systems Segment

Sales in 2018 were higher than the 2017 level primarily due to higher volume in the commercial and military aftermarket businesses, partially offset by lower volume in the commercial and military original equipment manufacturer (OEM) businesses.  Sales in 2017 were higher than the 2016 level primarily due to higher volume in the military OEM and commercial and military aftermarket businesses, partially offset by lower volume in the commercial OEM business.

The higher margin in 2018 was primarily due to a favorable product mix resulting from higher aftermarket volume and profitability and lower engineering development and operating expenses, partially offset by unfavorable contract settlements and higher product support costs.  The slightly lower margin in 2017 was primarily due to an unfavorable OEM product mix, higher warranty-related costs, higher favorable contract settlements in 2016 and higher business realignment expenses, partially offset by higher aftermarket profitability and lower engineering development and operating expenses.

The increase in backlog in 2018 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the commercial and military OEM businesses and the commercial and military aftermarket businesses.  The decrease in backlog in 2017 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in the commercial and military OEM businesses, partially offset by orders exceeding shipments in the commercial and military aftermarket businesses. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer.  The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.

For 2019, sales are expected to increase between 2.5 and 4.5 percent from the 2018 level and operating margins are expected to range from 17.2 to 17.6 percent.  A higher concentration of commercial OEM volume in future product mix and higher than expected new product development costs could result in lower margins.

The increase in assets in 2018 was primarily due to increases in trade accounts receivable and other receivables, partially offset by a decrease in other assets.  The decrease in assets in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in trade accounts receivable, intangible assets and other assets, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents and inventory.

Corporate

general and administrative expenses were $200.9 million in 2018 compared to $172.6 million in 2017 and $173.2 million in 2016.  As a percent of sales, corporate general and administrative expenses in both 2018 and 2017 were 1.4 percent compared to 1.5 percent in 2016.  The higher expense in 2018 was primarily due to higher expenses associated with the Company's incentive compensation programs.  The lower expense in 2017 was primarily due to lower expenses associated with the Company's deferred compensation program as well as lower professional services fees.

Corporate assets decreased 28.9 percent in 2018 compared to a decrease of 62.1 percent from 2016 to 2017.  The decrease in Corporate assets in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in non-current deferred taxes.  The decrease in Corporate assets in 2017 was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and non-current deferred taxes.  Decreases in these assets in 2017 primarily resulted from the Clarcor acquisition.



Other expense

(in the Business Segment Information)

Foreign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions.  The lower pension expense in 2018 is primarily due to a lower level of amortization of past actuarial losses.  The lower pension expense in 2017 is primarily due to a change in methodology to use of the spot yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost instead of the single-weighted average discount rate.  Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns in 2018 includes a net gain on the sale of assets, partially offset by a loss on the sale of the global Facet filtration business.  Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns in 2017 includes a gain on the sale of the Company's Autoline product line.  Acquisition expenses in 2017 primarily relate to Clarcor (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

The Consolidated Balance Sheet shows the Company's financial position at year-end, compared with the previous year-end.  This discussion provides information to assist in assessing factors such as the Company's liquidity and financial resources.

Cash

(comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments)

includes $836 million and $874 million held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  As a result of the TCJ Act, the prior worldwide tax system was replaced by a territorial tax system, which generally allows companies to repatriate future foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes.  However, other U.S. or foreign taxes may be incurred should cash be distributed between the Company's subsidiaries.  The Company has determined it will no longer permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings.  All other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested.  Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Trade accounts receivable, net

are receivables due from customers for sales of product.  Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 51 days in both 2018 and 2017.  The Company believes that its receivables are collectible and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts have been recorded.

Inventories

increased $72 million from 2017 primarily due to a $107 million increase in inventories in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by a decrease of $20 million related to a sale of a business and a decrease of $10 million in the Aerospace Systems Segment.  Days supply of inventory on hand was 64 days in 2018 and 67 days in 2017.



Shareholders' equity

activity during 2018 included a decrease of $300 million related to share repurchases, an increase of $179 million related to pensions and postretirement benefits resulting from net actuarial gains and amortizations and a decrease of $18 million related to foreign currency translation adjustments.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the Company's operating, investing and financing activities.

A summary of cash flows follows:

Cash flows from operating activities

in 2018 reflects an increase in net income from 2017 of $77 million and a reduction of $251 million for cash used by working capital items.  Cash flows from operating activities in 2017 reflects an increase in net income from 2016 of $177 million and a reduction of $28 million for cash used by working capital items.  Cash flows from operating activities in 2016 reflects an increase of $120 million for cash provided by working capital items.  The Company also made discretionary cash contributions to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan of $220 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2016.

Cash flows from investing activities

in 2018 benefited from proceeds related to the sale of the global Facet filtration business, and sale of plant and equipment.  Cash flows from investing activity in 2017 includes $4,069 million related to acquisition activities, primarily for the Clarcor acquisition.  Cash flows from investing activities in 2018, 2017, and 2016 also includes $3 million, $814 million, and $(51) million, respectively, in net maturities (purchases) of marketable securities and other investments.

Cash flows from financing activities

during 2018 included the repayment of long-term debt of approximately $945 million. Cash flows from financing activities during 2017 included the issuance of approximately $2,646 million of notional borrowings of long-term debt as well as the repayment of long-term debt of approximately $381 million, which includes debt assumed in the Clarcor acquisition. The Company repurchased 1.7 million common shares for $300 million during 2018 as compared to the repurchase of 2.0 million common shares for $265 million in 2017 and 5.1 million common shares for $558 million in 2016.

Dividends have been paid for 272 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 62 years.  The current annual dividend rate is $3.04 per common share.

The Company’s goal is to maintain no less than an “A” rating on senior debt to ensure availability and reasonable cost of external funds.  In periods following significant capital deployment, including for share repurchases or acquisitions, certain of the ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt may be, and at June 30, 2018 and 2017 were, lower than the stated goal.  The Company's ability to borrow funds at desirable tenors and interest rates in 2018 and 2017 was not significantly impacted by certain ratings on senior debt that were below an "A" level.  The Company does not believe that its ability to borrow funds in the future at desirable tenors and affordable interest rates will be impacted if certain of its ratings are below an "A" level at the time of such borrowings.  At June 30, 2018, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows:



As of June 30, 2018, the Company had a line of credit totaling

$2,000

million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, of which

$1,466

million was available at June 30, 2018.  Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

The Company is currently authorized to sell up to

$2,000

million of short-term commercial paper notes.  There were

$534

million outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2018, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2018 was

$736

million.

The Company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements.  The Company is in compliance with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit agreements and indentures.

Contractual Obligations

- The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was

$175 million

at June 30, 2018.  Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities.  Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the Company's fixed contractual obligations.  References to Notes are to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.

Revenue Recognition

- Substantially all of the Diversified Industrial Segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time the product is shipped.  The Aerospace Systems Segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method, and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the units-of-delivery method. The Company estimates costs to complete long-term contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves.  The estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved.  Adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.



Impairment of Goodwill

and Long-Lived Assets

- Goodwill is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value.  For the Company, a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level.  Determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which the Company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model.  The Company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting unit's fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available.  The discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions.  Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis.  The Company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital, adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor.  The Company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the Company's overall market capitalization.

The results of the Company's 2018 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of December 31, 2017 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed.  However, certain reporting units within the Diversified Industrial Segment had estimated fair values that the Company determined, from a quantitative and qualitative perspective, were not significantly in excess of their carrying values.  For these reporting units, the sales growth assumptions had the most significant influence on the estimation of fair value. The key uncertainties in these sales growth assumptions include end-market growth, the ability to secure business with new customers and new product development.  The Company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate. The Company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units.  If actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests.

Long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test.  During 2018, there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the Company's long-lived assets held for use were not recoverable.

Pensions

- The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis.  This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses.  Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date.  Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements.  Beginning in 2017, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs from the single-weighted average discount rate to spot yield curve approach.  The change does not affect the measurement of the Company's benefit obligations.  The new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and was accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017.  Annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 was lower by approximately $30 million compared to the previous method.  Annual net periodic postretirement cost was not materially different.

For the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a $14 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $17 million.  As of June 30, 2018, $841 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future.  These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future.  Actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization.  Further information on pensions is provided in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Income Taxes

- Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities.  Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse.  The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available.  For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On December 22, 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted into law.  The TCJ Act significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, by among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and creating a territorial tax system (with a one time transition tax imposed on previously unremitted foreign earnings and profits).  The Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the TCJ Act.  SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year of the TCJ Act’s enactment date, to complete the applicable accounting of the related tax impacts of the TCJ Act. The final impact of the TCJ Act may differ from the provisional amounts recorded in the current period, due to, among other things, any updates to estimates that have been utilized in the calculation of the tax impacts, changes in interpretation of the existing law, or additional guidance from U. S. Treasury department or the Internal Revenue Service.

Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Loss Contingencies

- The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves.  Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. These loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 7A

.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

.

The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges.  The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties.  The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value.  Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Gains or losses on derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income.  Gains or losses on derivatives that are hedges are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk.  The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates.  A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at

June 30, 2018

by approximately

$7 million

issued by COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The

Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Significant Accounting Policies

The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below.

Nature of Operations

-

The Company is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.  The Company evaluates performance based on segment operating income before corporate administrative expenses, interest expense and income taxes.

The Diversified Industrial Segment is an aggregation of several business units, which manufacture motion-control and fluid power system components for builders and users of various types of manufacturing, packaging, processing, transportation, agricultural, construction, and military vehicles and equipment.  Diversified Industrial Segment products are marketed primarily through field sales employees and independent distributors.  The Diversified Industrial North American operations have manufacturing plants and distribution networks throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico and primarily service North America.  The Diversified Industrial International operations provide Parker products and services to


countries throughout Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.

The Aerospace Systems Segment produces hydraulic, fuel, pneumatic and electro-mechanical systems and components, which are utilized on virtually every domestic commercial, military and general aviation aircraft and also performs a vital role in naval vessels and land-based weapons systems.  This segment serves original equipment and maintenance, repair and overhaul customers worldwide.  Aerospace Systems Segment products are marketed by field sales employees and are sold directly to manufacturers and end users.

There are

no

individual customers to whom sales are more than

three

percent of the Company's consolidated sales.  Due to the diverse group of customers throughout the world, the Company does not consider itself exposed to any concentration of credit risks.

The Company manufactures and markets its products throughout the world.  Although certain risks and uncertainties exist, the diversity and breadth of the Company's products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes with respect to any particular product and geographic operation would materially affect the Company's operating results.

Use of Estimates -

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Basis of Consolidation -

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions and profits have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements.  Within the Business Segment Information, intersegment and interarea sales have been eliminated.

Revenue Recognition -

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time the product is shipped.  Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs in cost of sales.  Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue.

Long-term Contracts -

The Company enters into long-term contracts primarily for the production of aerospace products.  For financial statement purposes, revenues are primarily recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.  The extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the units-of-delivery method.  Unbilled costs on these contracts are included in inventory.  Progress payments are netted against the inventory balances.  The Company estimates costs to complete long-term contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves.  Adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.

Cash -

Cash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid investments, with a three-month or less maturity, carried at cost plus accrued interest, which are readily convertible into cash.



Marketable Securities and Other Investments -

Consist of short-term highly liquid investments, with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase, carried at cost plus accrued interest, and investments classified as available-for-sale, which are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss).  Gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are calculated based on the first-in, first-out method.  The Company has the ability to liquidate the available-for-sale investments after giving appropriate notice to the issuer.

Trade Accounts Receivable, Net

- Trade accounts receivable are initially recorded at their net collectible amount and are generally recorded at the time the revenue from the sales transaction is recorded.  Receivables are written off to bad debt primarily when, in the judgment of the Company, the receivable is deemed to be uncollectible due to the insolvency of the debtor.  Allowance for doubtful accounts was

$9,672

and

$14,336

at

June 30, 2018

and


, respectively.

Non-Trade and Notes Receivable

- The non-trade and notes receivable caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is comprised of the following components:

Plant, Equipment and Depreciation -

Plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated principally using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.  Depreciation rates are based on estimated useful lives of the assets, generally

40 years

for buildings,

15 years

for land improvements and building equipment,

seven

to

10 years

for machinery and equipment, and

three

to

eight years

for vehicles and office equipment.  Improvements, which extend the useful life of property, are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are expensed.  The Company reviews plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.  When plant and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the appropriate accounts and any gain or loss is included in current income.

The plant and equipment caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is comprised of the following components:

Investments and Other Assets -

Investments in joint-venture companies in which ownership is

50 percent

or less and in which the Company does not have operating control are stated at cost plus the Company's equity in undistributed earnings and amounted to

$304,389

and

$341,869

at

June 30, 2018

and


, respectively.  A significant portion of the underlying net assets of the joint ventures are related to goodwill.  The Company's share of earnings from investments in joint-venture companies were

$50,473

,

$42,352

and

$25,650

in


,


and


, respectively.

Intangible Assets

-

Intangible assets primarily include patents, trademarks and customer lists and are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line method.  Patents are amortized over the shorter of their remaining useful or legal life.  Trademarks are amortized over the estimated time period over which an economic benefit is expected to be received.  Customer lists are amortized over a period based on anticipated customer attrition rates.  The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.

Goodwill -

The Company conducts a formal impairment test of goodwill on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

Income Taxes -

Income taxes are provided based upon income for financial reporting purposes.  Tax credits and similar tax incentives are applied to reduce the provision for income taxes in the year in which the credits arise.  The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  Penalties, if incurred, are recognized in income tax expense.  Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax purposes.



Foreign Currency Translation -

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated using weighted-average exchange rates.  The effects of these translation adjustments, as well as gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are reported in the accumulated other comprehensive (loss) component of shareholders' equity.  Such adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investments.  Exchange losses (gains) from transactions in a currency other than the local currency of the entity involved are included within the cost of sales caption in the Consolidated Statement of Income and were

$7,284

,

$8,060

and

$22,750

, in


,


and


, respectively.

Subsequent Events

- The Company has evaluated subsequent events that have occurred through the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

June 30, 2018

.  No subsequent events occurred that required adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements -

In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-02, "Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."  ASU 2018-02 allows for a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJ Act reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.  The amendments also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects.  ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted in any period after the issuance of the update.  The amendments in this update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the TCJ Act is recognized.  The Company has not yet determined the effect that ASU 2018-02 will have on its financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, "Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities."  ASU 2017-12 provides targeted improvements to Topic 815 accounting for hedging activities by expanding an entity’s ability to hedge non-financial and financial risk components and reduce complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk.  The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The guidance also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early application is permitted in any interim period after issuance of the update. ASU 2017-12 should be applied using a modified retrospective approach for cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption and prospectively for presentation and disclosure requirements.  The Company has not yet determined the effect that ASU 2017-12 will have on its financial statements.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, "Scope of Modification Accounting."  ASU 2017-09 provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718.  An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all of the following are met: (1) the fair value of the modified award is the same as fair value of the original award; (2) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified; and (3) the classification of the award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.  ASU 2017-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  ASU 2017-09 should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2017-09.  The adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not affect the Company's financial statements as there were no modifications of any share-based awards during 2018.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, "Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost."  ASU 2017-07 requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented.  ASU 2017-07 also provides that only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable.  ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  ASU 2017-07 should be applied retrospectively for the income statement presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost and prospectively, on or after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost.  The Company expects that adoption of this standard will result in a reclassification of expense from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses to other (income) of approximately

$25 million

and

$17 million

, respectively, for 2018 and

$70 million

and

$41 million

, respectively, for 2017.



In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."  ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.  Under the amendments in this Update, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  ASU 2017-04 also eliminates the requirement for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.  ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04.  The adoption of ASU 2017-04 did not affect the Company's financial statements as there were no instances of a reporting unit's carrying value exceeding its fair value for any goodwill impairment tests performed during 2018.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, "Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory."  ASU 2016-16 provides that an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.  Consequently, the amendments in ASU 2016-16 eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory.  ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 31, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company expects that the cumulative effect of the adoption of ASU 2016-16 will result in a reduction to retained earnings of approximately

$18 million

.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."  ASU 2016-15 provides specific guidance on several cash flow classification issues to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  After consideration of the current level of transactions within the scope of ASU 2016-15, the Company does not expect that the retrospective adoption of this standard at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019 will have a material impact on its financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."  ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.  Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases." ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to put most leases with terms greater than 12 months on their balance sheet by recognizing a liability to make lease payments and an asset representing their right to use the asset during the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election, by class of underlying asset, not to recognize the corresponding assets and lease liabilities. Lessee recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows will not change significantly from existing guidance and lessor accounting is largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 also changes the definition of a lease and requires qualitative, and quantitative disclosures that provide information about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU is planned for the beginning of the first quarter of 2020.  The Company has not yet determined the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities."  ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (excluding equity method investments and investments that are consolidated) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value may be measured at cost, adjusted for impairment and observable price changes.  ASU 2016-01 also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments, eliminates the disclosure of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at cost on the balance sheet and requires the exit price to be used when measuring fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.  Under ASU 2016-01, changes in fair value (resulting from instrument-specific credit risk) will be presented separately in other comprehensive income for liabilities measured using the fair value option. Financial assets and liabilities will be presented separately by measurement category and type, either on the balance sheet or in the financial statement disclosures.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company does not expect that the retrospective adoption of ASU 2016-01 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019 will have a material impact on its financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers."  ASU 2014-09 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that a company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.  To achieve this principle, a company must apply five steps including identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the



transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) the company satisfies the performance obligations.  Additional quantitative and qualitative disclosure to enhance the understanding about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows is also required.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing."  ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of ASU 2014-09:  identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance.  The effective date of ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of  ASU 2014-09.  The Company has elected to adopt ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method.  The Company does not expect that the cumulative effect of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019 will have a material impact on retained earnings.  We expect to provide the required additional disclosures in periods subsequent to the adoption.

2.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions -

During


, the Company completed

three

acquisitions, including Clarcor, whose aggregate sales for their most recent fiscal year prior to acquisition were approximately

$1,522 million

.  Total purchase price for the

three

acquisitions was approximately

$4,227 million

in cash and

$316 million

in assumed debt.

During


, the Company completed

two

acquisitions whose aggregate sales for their most recent fiscal year prior to acquisition were approximately

$48 million

.  Total purchase price for the

two

acquisitions was approximately

$71 million

in cash and

$2 million

in assumed debt.

The results of operations for all acquisitions were included as of the respective dates of acquisition.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.  The process of estimating the fair values of certain tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. Revisions occur as valuations are finalized, additional information becomes available and as additional analysis is performed.  All measurement period adjustments were completed within a year from the acquisition date, and such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.  The initial purchase price allocation for acquisitions in


and


are as follows:



Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired, primarily all of which is not deductible for tax purposes.  With respect to the Clarcor acquisition, goodwill represents cost synergies and enhancements to the Company's existing filtration technologies.

The remaining disclosures in Note 2 pertain only to the Clarcor acquisition as the other

two

acquisitions completed during 2017 were immaterial.

Clarcor is a major manufacturer of filtration products under more than a dozen respected brands, including CLARCOR, Baldwin, Fuel Manager, PECOFacet, Airguard, Altair, BHA, Clearcurrent, Clark Filter, Hastings, United Air Specialists, Keddeg and Purolator.  Clarcor had annual sales of approximately

$1,400 million

for its fiscal 2016.  For segment reporting purposes, Clarcor is part of the Diversified Industrial Segment.

The Company believes that Clarcor is a highly complementary acquisition that provides the Company with additional proprietary media, industrial and process filtration products and technologies, as well as a broad portfolio of replacement filters.  The acquisition of Clarcor also offers significant expected operating synergies.

The Company's results of operations for 2017 include Clarcor's results of operations from the date of acquisition, February 28, 2017, through June 30, 2017.  Net sales and segment operating (loss) attributable to Clarcor during this period was

$487,388

and

$(16,164)

, respectively.

The following unaudited pro forma information gives effect to the Company's acquisition of Clarcor as if the acquisition had occurred on July 1, 2015, and Clarcor had been included in the Company's results of operations for 2017 and 2016.

The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table above includes adjustments related to amortization expense, depreciation, interest expense and transaction costs incurred as well as adjustments to cost of sales for the step-up in inventory to estimated acquisition-date fair value and related income tax effects and was based on a preliminary purchase price allocation using information available at that time.  Transaction costs incurred (which are reflected in the selling, general and administrative expenses caption in the Consolidated Statement of Income) and the adjustment to cost of sales for the step-up in inventory to estimated acquisition-date fair value are considered to be non-recurring.  Adjustments for non-recurring items increased pro forma net income attributable to common shareholders by

$108,078

for 2017 and decreased pro forma net income attributable to common shareholders by

$39,121

for 2016.   The unaudited pro forma financial information does not give effect to any synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result or have resulted from the Clarcor acquisition.

Divestitures

- During 2018, the Company divested its global Facet filtration business, which was part of the Diversified Industrial Segment. The operating results and net assets of the global Facet filtration business were immaterial to the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.  The Company recorded a pre-tax loss in 2018 of approximately

$20 million

and tax expense of approximately

$29 million

resulting from a tax gain related to the divestiture.  The pre-tax loss is reflected in the (gain) on disposal of assets caption in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the other expense caption in the Business Segment Information.

During 2017, the Company divested its Autoline product line, which was part of the Diversified Industrial Segment.  The operating results and net assets of the Autoline product line were immaterial to the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.  The Company recorded a net pre-tax gain in 2017 of approximately

$45 million

related to the divestiture.  The gain is reflected in the (gain) on disposal of assets caption in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the other expense caption in the Business Segment Information.

Charges Related to Business Realignment

The Company incurred business realignment charges in


,


and


.  The Company also incurred acquisition integration costs in


and


related to the 2017 acquisition of Clarcor.

Business realignment charges and acquisition integration costs presented in the Business Segment Information are as follows:

Work force reductions in connection with such business realignment charges and acquisition integration costs in the Business Segment Information are as follows:

The business realignment charges primarily relate to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity.  Business realignment charges and acquisition integration costs primarily consist of severance costs as well as plant closures, with the majority of charges incurred in Europe and North America.  In connection with a plant closure during 2016, the Company recognized an expense associated with enhanced retirement benefits (refer to Note 10 for further discussion).  The Company believes the realignment and acquisition integration actions taken will positively impact future results of operations but will not have a material effect on liquidity and sources and uses of capital.

The business realignment charges and acquisition integration costs are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income as follows:

As of

June 30, 2018

, approximately

$40 million

in severance payments have been made relating to business realignment and acquisition integration charges incurred during


, the remainder of which are expected to be paid by

June 30, 2019

.  Severance payments relating to prior-year actions are being made as required.  Remaining severance payments related to current-year and prior-year business realignment and acquisition integration actions of approximately

$26 million

are primarily reflected within the other accrued liabilities caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Additional charges may be recognized in future periods related to the business realignment and acquisition integration actions described above, the timing and amount of which are not known at this time.

4.

Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted into law.  The TCJ Act significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, by among other things, establishing a flat corporate income tax rate of

21 percent

and creating a territorial tax system (with a one-time transition tax imposed on previously undistributed foreign earnings and profits).

The Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the TCJ Act.  SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the TCJ Act's enactment date for companies to complete the applicable accounting under Topic 740. In accordance with SAB 118, and based on the information available as of

June 30, 2018

, the Company recorded a net provisional discrete income tax cost of

$233 million

as a result of the TCJ Act being enacted.



The reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate under the TCJ Act required a one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets and liabilities to reflect their value at the reduced corporate tax rate of

21 percent

, which resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of approximately

$80 million

.  The one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings and profits resulted in an increase in income tax expense of

$297 million

.  Incremental adjustments have been made to these estimates during the three months ended

June 30, 2018

, based on the availability of additional information.  The Company has not yet completed the accounting for the one-time transition tax and continues to analyze undistributed foreign earnings and profits for purposes of filing the tax return for 2018.  In addition, the Company continues to interpret the law and guidance issued as of the date of these financial statements.  On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations relating to the one-time transition tax.  The proposed regulations are subject to a 60-day comment period. Final regulations are expected to be issued after consideration of the comments.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed regulations.  The Company intends to make the election to pay the one-time transition tax over

eight years

.  The amount of cash payments will be less than the amount of the income tax expense due to the utilization of available credits.

Certain provisions of the TCJ Act will impact the Company starting in 2019.  These provisions include, but are not limited to, the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a general limitation of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income and the repeal of the domestic production activities deduction.  The Company continues to evaluate the future impacts of these provisions and, as of

June 30, 2018

, has not recorded any impact of any of these future provisions.

Income before income taxes was derived from the following sources:

Income taxes include the following:

A reconciliation of the Company's effective income tax rate to the statutory federal rate follows:



Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The differences comprising the net deferred taxes shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30 were as follows:

As of

June 30, 2018

, the Company recorded deferred tax assets of

$679,880

resulting from

$2,633,218

in loss carryforwards.  A valuation allowance of

$675,045

related to the loss carryforwards has been established due to the uncertainty of their realization.  Of this valuation allowance,

$640,239

relates to non-operating entities whose loss carryforward utilization is considered to be remote.  Some of the loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely; others can be carried forward from

three

to

20 years

.  In addition, a valuation allowance of

$19,812

related to future deductible items has been established due to the uncertainty of their realization.  These future deductible items are recorded in the other liabilities and reserves line in the table above.

Historically, all foreign undistributed earnings were permanently reinvested in international operations.  No tax was provided on such earnings as it was not practicable to estimate the additional tax that might be payable on the eventual distribution.  The enactment of the TCJ Act created a territorial tax system significantly reducing the U.S. federal tax cost of future distributions.  Although future distributions of foreign earnings to the U.S. should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, other U.S. or foreign taxes may be imposed on such earnings.  The Company has analyzed existing factors and determined it will no longer permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings.  On these undistributed foreign earnings of approximately

$274 million

that are no longer permanently reinvested outside of the U.S., the Company has recorded a deferred tax liability of

$12 million

. The remaining undistributed foreign earnings of approximately

$2,700 million

remain permanently reinvested outside the U.S. at

June 30, 2018

.  Of these undistributed earnings, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $

4 million

where certain foreign holding companies are not permanently reinvested in their subsidiaries.  It is not practicable to estimate the additional taxes, including applicable foreign withholding taxes, that might be payable on the potential distribution of such permanently reinvested foreign earnings.



A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was

$153,091

,

$95,460

and

$80,722

as of

June 30, 2018

,


and


, respectively.  If recognized, a significant portion of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2017, and 2016, would have been offset against an asset that had been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The accrued interest related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluded from the amounts above, was

$21,737

,

$15,432

and

$12,357

as of

June 30, 2018

,


and


, respectively.

It is reasonably possible that, within the next 12 months, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to approximately

$120,000

as a result of the revaluation of existing uncertain tax positions arising from developments in the examination process or the closure of tax statutes.  Any increase in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is expected to be insignificant.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions.  In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.  The Company is open to assessment of its U.S. federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service for years after


, and its state and local tax returns for years after


.  The Company is open to assessment for significant foreign jurisdictions for years after


.

5.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the year.  Common share equivalents represent the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards.  The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows:

For


,


and


,

0.5 million

,

1.4 million

and

3.1 million

common shares, respectively, subject to equity-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of their exercise would be anti-dilutive.



6.

Inventories

The majority of domestic inventories are valued by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method and the balance of the Company's inventories are valued by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.  Inventories valued by the FIFO cost method are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Inventories valued by the LIFO cost method are stated at lower of cost or market.

Inventories valued on the LIFO cost method were approximately


percent of total inventories in


and


percent of total inventories in


.  The current cost of these inventories exceeds their valuation determined on the LIFO basis by

$203,192

in


and

$193,933

in


.  Progress payments of

$25,026

in


and

$44,231

in


are netted against inventories.

The inventories caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is comprised of the following components:

7.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

Acquisitions represent the original goodwill allocation, purchase price adjustments and final adjustments to the purchase price allocation for the acquisitions during the measurement period subsequent to the applicable acquisition dates. The impact of the purchase price adjustments and final adjustments to the purchase price allocation on the Company's results of operations and financial position were immaterial.  Divestitures primarily represent goodwill associated with the sale of a business in 2018 and a product line in 2017 (see Note 2 for further discussion).

The Company's annual impairment tests performed in


,


and


resulted in

Financing Arrangements

The Company has a line of credit totaling

$2,000,000

through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, of which

$1,466,200

was available at

June 30, 2018

.  The credit agreement expires in October 2021; however, the Company has the right to request a

one

-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement.  Advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness.  The credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which may increase in the event the Company's credit ratings are lowered.  Although a lowering of the Company's credit ratings would likely increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the Company's ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings.

The Company is currently authorized to sell up to

$2,000,000

of short-term commercial paper notes.  Commercial paper notes outstanding at

June 30, 2018

and


were

$533,800

and

$534,200

, respectively.

In addition to commercial paper notes, notes payable includes short-term lines of credit and borrowings from foreign banks.  At

June 30, 2018

and


, the Company had

$48,338

and

$62,946

, respectively, in lines of credit from various foreign banks,

none

of which were outstanding at

June 30, 2018

and


.  Most of these agreements are renewed annually.  The Company had borrowings from foreign banks of

$4,255

at

June 30, 2018

.  The weighted-average interest rate on notes payable during


and


was

1.8 percent

and

1.0 percent

, respectively.

The Company's foreign locations in the ordinary course of business may enter into financial guarantees through financial institutions which enable customers to be reimbursed in the event of nonperformance by the Company.

The Company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements.  Based on the Company's rating level at

June 30, 2018

, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed

0.60

to 1.0.  As of

June 30, 2018

, the Company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was

0.46

to 1.0.  The Company is in compliance with all covenants.

Retirement Benefits

Pensions -

The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. Plans for most salaried employees provide pay-related benefits based on years of service. Plans for hourly employees generally provide benefits based on flat-dollar amounts and years of service.  The Company also has arrangements for certain key employees which provide for supplemental retirement benefits.  In general, the Company's policy is to fund these plans based on legal requirements, tax considerations, local practices and investment opportunities.  The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans and participates in government-sponsored programs in certain foreign countries.

A summary of the Company's defined benefit pension plans follows:



The presentation of the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) is on a debit (credit) basis and excludes the effect of income taxes.

Beginning in 2017, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs from the single-weighted average discount rate to the spot yield curve approach.  The change does not affect the measurement of the Company's benefit obligations.  The new method provides a more precise measure of these components by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and is accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively.  As a result of the method change, net pension benefit cost for 2017 is lower than the net pension benefit cost for 2016 by

$29,777

.

During 2016, the Company provided enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure, which resulted in an increase in net pension benefit cost of

$7,088

.



The estimated amount of net actuarial loss, prior service cost and transition obligation that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) into net periodic benefit pension cost in


is

$114,825

,

$6,286

and

$18

, respectively.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was

$4,751,111

and

$4,890,058

at

June 30, 2018

and


, respectively.  The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were

$4,933,863

,

$4,665,272

and

$3,807,859

, respectively, at

June 30, 2018

, and

$5,142,881

and

$3,815,815

, respectively, at

June 30, 2017

.

The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately

$70 million

to its defined benefit pension plans in


, the majority of which relate to its non-U.S. defined benefit plans.  Estimated future benefit payments in the five years ending

June 30,


through


are

$240,163

,

$242,051

,

$259,402

,

$305,553

and

$267,258

, respectively and

$1,454,646

in the aggregate for the five years ending

June 30,

2024 through

June 30,

2028.

The assumptions used to measure net periodic benefit cost for the Company's significant defined benefit plans are:

The assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation for the Company's significant defined benefit plans are:

The discount rate assumption is based on current rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds over the same estimated time period that benefit payments will be required to be made.  The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on the weighted-average expected return of the various asset classes in the plans' portfolio.  The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.

The weighted-average allocation of the majority of the assets related to defined benefit plans is as follows:



The weighted-average target asset allocation as of

June 30, 2018

is

41 percent

equity securities,

47 percent

debt securities and

12 percent

other investments.  The investment strategy for the Company's worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets focuses on achieving prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable levels of risk in order to provide adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit requirements.  This strategy requires investment portfolios that are broadly diversified across various asset classes and external investment managers.  Assets held in the U.S. defined benefit plans account for approximately

74 percent

of the Company's total defined benefit plan assets.  The Company's overall investment strategy with respect to the Company's U.S. defined benefit plans is to opportunistically migrate from its traditional mix between growth seeking assets (primarily consisting of global public equities in developed and emerging countries and hedge fund of fund strategies) and income generating assets (primarily consisting of high quality bonds, both domestic and global, emerging market bonds, high yield bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities) to an allocation more heavily weighted toward income generating assets.  Over time, long duration fixed income assets are being added to the portfolio.  These securities are highly correlated with the Company's pension liabilities and will serve to hedge a portion of the Company's interest rate risk.

The fair values of pension plan assets at

June 30, 2018

and at

June 30, 2017

, by asset class, are as follows:



Cash and cash equivalents, which include repurchase agreements and other short-term investments, are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.

Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.  U.S. based companies include Company stock with a fair value of

$207,202

and

$212,480

as of

June 30, 2018

and


, respectively.

Fixed income securities are valued using both market observable inputs for similar assets that are traded on an active market and the closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

Mutual funds are valued using the closing market price reported on the active market on which the fund is traded or at net asset value per share and primarily consist of equity and fixed income funds.  The equity funds primarily provide exposure to U.S. and international equities, real estate and commodities.  The fixed income funds primarily provide exposure to high-yield securities and emerging market fixed income instruments.  Mutual funds measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Common/Collective trusts primarily consist of equity and fixed income funds and are valued using the closing market price reported on the active market on which the fund is traded or at net asset value per share.  Common/Collective trust investments can be redeemed without restriction after giving appropriate notice to the issuer.  Generally, redemption of the entire investment balance requires a


-day notice period.  The equity funds provide exposure to large, mid and small cap U.S. equities, international large and small cap equities and emerging market equities.  The fixed income funds provide exposure to U.S., international and emerging market debt securities.  Common/Collective trusts measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the Consolidated Balance Sheet.



Limited Partnerships primarily consist of hedge funds valued using a net asset value per share and provide exposure to a variety of hedging strategies including long/short equity, relative value, event driven and global macro.  Limited Partnership investments can be redeemed either monthly or quarterly and without restriction after giving appropriate notice to the issuer.  Redemption of the entire investment balance generally requires no more than a


-day notice period.  Limited Partnerships measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Miscellaneous primarily includes real estate funds, insurance contracts held in the asset portfolio of the Company's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, and net payables for securities purchased but not settled in the asset portfolio of the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans.  Insurance contracts are valued at the present value of future cash flows promised under the terms of the insurance contracts.

The primary investment objective of equity securities and equity funds, within both the mutual fund and common/collective trust asset class, is to obtain capital appreciation in an amount that at least equals various market-based benchmarks.  The primary investment objective of fixed income securities and fixed income funds, within both the mutual fund and common/collective trust asset class, is to provide for a constant stream of income while preserving capital.  The primary investment objective of limited partnerships is to achieve capital appreciation through an investment program focused on specialized investment strategies.  The primary investment objective of insurance contracts, included in the miscellaneous asset class, is to provide a stable rate of return over a specified period of time.

Employee Savings Plan -

The Company sponsors an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) as part of its existing savings and investment 401(k) plan.  The ESOP is available to eligible domestic employees.  Company matching contributions, up to a maximum of

four percent

of an employee's annual compensation, are recorded as compensation expense.  Participants may direct company matching contributions to any investment option within the savings and investment 401(k) plan.

In addition to shares within the ESOP, as of

June 30, 2018

, employees have elected to invest in

1,870,286

shares of common stock within a company stock fund of the savings and investment 401(k) plan.

The Company has a retirement income account (RIA) within the employee savings plan.  The Company makes a cash contribution to the participant's RIA each year, the amount of which is based on the participant's age and years of service.  Participants do not contribute to the RIA.  The Company recognized

$29,023

,

$29,309

and

$25,780

in expense related to the RIA in


,


and


, respectively.

During 2017, the Company assumed various defined contribution plans previously sponsored by Clarcor.  The Company recognized expense of

$4,481

and

$2,199

in


and


, respectively, related to these defined contribution plans.  In January 2018, the former employees of Clarcor became eligible to participate in the savings and investment 401(k) plan.

Other Postretirement Benefits -

The Company provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain retirees and eligible dependents. Most plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually.  The plans are unfunded and pay stated percentages of covered medically necessary expenses incurred by retirees, after subtracting payments by Medicare or other providers and after stated deductibles have been met.  For most plans, the Company has established cost maximums to more effectively control future medical costs.  The Company has reserved the right to change these benefit plans.

The Company recognized

$2,755

,

$4,357

and

$8,754

in expense related to other postretirement benefits in


,


and


, respectively.  During 2016, the Company provided enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure, which resulted in an increase in expense related to other postretirement benefits of

$4,521

.



The presentation of the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) is on a debit (credit) basis and is before the effect of income taxes.  The amount of net actuarial loss and prior service credit that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) into net periodic postretirement cost in


is

$14

and

$(121)

, respectively.

The assumptions used to measure the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefit obligations are:

The discount rate assumption used to measure the benefit obligation was

3.92 percent

in


and

3.46 percent

in


.

Estimated future benefit payments for other postretirement benefits in the five years ending

June 30,


through


are

$6,463

,

$6,358

,

$5,967

,

$5,804

and

$5,564

, respectively, and

$24,842

in the aggregate for the five years ending

June 30,

2024 through

June 30,

2028.

A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the benefit cost or benefit obligation.

Other -

The Company has established nonqualified deferred compensation programs, which permit officers, directors and certain management employees annually to elect to defer a portion of their compensation, on a pre-tax basis, until their retirement.  The retirement benefit to be provided is based on the amount of compensation deferred, Company matching contributions and earnings on the deferrals.  In addition, the Company maintains a defined contribution nonqualified supplemental executive pension plan in which the Company is the only contributor.  During


,


and


, the Company recorded expense (income) relating to these programs of

$13,420

,

$20,400

and

$(2,917)

, respectively.

The Company has invested in corporate-owned life insurance policies to assist in meeting the obligation under these programs.  The policies are held in a rabbi trust and are recorded as assets of the Company.

On October 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the overall number of shares authorized to repurchase under the program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was

35 million

.  There is no limitation on the number of shares that can be repurchased in a year.  Repurchases may be funded primarily from operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings and the shares are initially held as treasury shares.  The number of common shares repurchased at the average purchase price follows:

Stock Incentive Plans

The Company's 2016 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of share-based incentive awards in the form of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted and unrestricted stock to officers and key employees of the Company.  The aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2016 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan is

16 million

.  At

June 30, 2018

,

11.6 million

common shares were available for future issuance.

The Company satisfies share-based incentive award obligations by issuing shares of common stock out of treasury, which have been repurchased pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program described in Note 11, or through the issuance of previously unissued common stock.

SARs

-  Upon exercise, SARs entitle the participant to receive shares of common stock equal to the increase in value of the award between the grant date and the exercise date.  SARs are exercisable from

one

to

three years

after the date of grant and expire no more than

10 years

after grant.

The fair value of each SAR award granted in


,


and


was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury yields

with a term similar to the expected life of the award

.

The expected life of the award was derived by referring to actual exercise and post-vesting employment termination experience.

The expected dividend yield was based on the Company's historical dividend rate and stock price over a period similar to the expected life of the award.

The expected volatility of stock was derived by referring to changes in the Company's historical common stock prices over a time-frame similar to the expected life of the award.

Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other investments, accounts receivable and long-term investments as well as obligations under accounts payable, trade, notes payable and long-term debt.  Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, trade and notes payable approximate fair value.

Marketable securities and other investments include deposits, which are recorded at cost, and investments classified as available-for-sale, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss).  Gross unrealized gains and losses were not material as of

June 30, 2018

and


.  There were no facts or circumstances that indicated the unrealized losses were other than temporary.



The contractual maturities of available-for-sale investments were predominantly one to three years at

June 30, 2018

and


.  Actual maturities of available-for-sale investments may differ from their contractual maturities as the Company has the ability to liquidate the available-for-sale investments after giving appropriate notice to the issuer.

The carrying value of long-term debt and estimated fair value of long-term debt at June 30 are as follows:

The fair value of long-term debt was determined based on observable market prices in the active market in which the security is traded and is classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges, to manage foreign currency transaction and translation risk.  The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties.  The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The Company’s €

700 million

aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2025 have been designated as a hedge of the Company’s net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.  The translation of the Senior Notes due 2025 into U.S. dollars is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value.

The location and fair value of derivative financial instruments reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows:

The cross-currency swap and costless collar contracts are reflected on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The Company has not entered into any master netting arrangements.

Gains or losses on derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through the cost of sales caption in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  Gains or losses on derivatives that are hedges are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

The cross-currency swap contracts have been designated as hedging instruments.  The costless collar contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and are considered to be economic hedges of forecasted transactions.

Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income during


,


and


were not material.

(Losses) on derivative and non-derivative financial instruments that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows:

and


.



A summary of financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis at

June 30, 2018

and


are as follows:

The fair values of the equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are determined using the closing market price reported in the active market in which the fund is traded or the market price for similar assets that are traded in an active market.

Derivatives consist of forward exchange, costless collar and cross-currency swap contracts, the fair values of which are calculated using market observable inputs including both spot and forward prices for the same underlying currencies.  The calculation of fair value of the cross-currency swap contracts also utilizes a present value cash flow model that has been adjusted to reflect the credit risk of either the Company or the counterparty.

Investments measured at net asset value primarily consist of investments in fixed income mutual funds, which are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient.  These investments have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.  The Company has the ability to liquidate these investments after giving appropriate notice to the issuer.

The primary investment objective for all investments is the preservation of principal and liquidity while earning income.

There are no other financial assets or financial liabilities that are marked to market on a recurring basis.  Fair values are transferred between levels of the fair value hierarchy when facts and circumstances indicate that a change in the method of estimating the fair value of a financial asset or financial liability is warranted.

Contingencies

The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings based on product liability claims, workers' compensation claims and alleged violations of various environmental laws.  The Company is self-insured in the United States for health care, workers' compensation, general liability and product liability up to predetermined amounts, above which third party insurance applies.  Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of these proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage and the established accruals for liabilities.  While the outcome of pending proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that any liabilities that may result from these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

Environmental -

The Company is currently responsible for environmental remediation at various manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and has been named as a “potentially responsible party,” along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and

regional sites.

As of

June 30, 2018

, the Company had an accrual of

$18,024

for environmental matters, which are probable and reasonably estimable.  The accrual is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of the Company's liability in proportion to other responsible parties.

The Company's estimated total liability for environmental matters ranges from a minimum of

$18.0 million

to a maximum of

$81.0 million

.  The largest range for any one site is approximately

$9.5 million

.  The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries.
