a simple fluid power system include a pump which generates pressure, valves 
which control the fluid's flow, an actuator which translates the pressure in 
the fluid into mechanical energy, a filter to remove contaminants and numerous 
hoses, couplings, fittings and seals.  Electromechanical control involves the 
use of electronic components and systems to control motion and precisely locate
or vary speed in automation applications.  In addition to motion control 
products, the Company also is a leading worldwide producer of fluid 
purification, air conditioning, refrigeration, and electromagnetic shielding 
and thermal management products.

Principal Products, Methods of Distribution and Competitive Conditions
- - ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Industrial Segment.  The product lines of the Company's Industrial 
Segment cover most of the components of motion control systems.  The Fluid 
Connectors Group manufactures connectors, including tube fittings and hose 
fittings, valves, hoses and couplers which control, transmit and contain fluid.
The Motion & Control Group manufactures components and systems used to provide
motion, control and conditioning through the medium of pressurized fluids and 
electricity.  Products include hydraulic, pneumatic and precision metering 
pumps, power units, control valves, general purpose valves, accumulators, 
cylinders, servo actuators, rotary actuators and motors, pneumatic control 
valves, pressure regulators, lubricators, hydrostatic steering components, 
electronic controls and systems and automation devices.  The Climate and 
Industrial Controls Group manufactures components for use in industrial, 
residential and automotive air conditioning and refrigeration systems and 
other automotive applications, including pressure regulators, solenoid valves,
expansion valves, filter-dryers, gerotors and hose assemblies.  The Seal Group
manufactures sealing devices, including o-rings and o-seals, gaskets and 
packings which insure leak proof connections and electromagnetic interference 
shielding and thermal management products.  The Filtration Group manufactures 
filters to remove contaminants from fuel, air, oil, water and other fluids in
industrial, process, mobile, marine and environmental applications. 

        Industrial Segment products include both standard items which are 
produced in large quantities and custom units which are engineered and produced
to original equipment manufacturers' specifications for application to a 
particular end product. Both standard and custom products are also used in the
replacement of original motion control system components.  Industrial Segment 
products are marketed primarily through field sales employees and more than 
7,000 independent distributors.

        Aerospace Segment.  The principal products of the Company's Aerospace 
Segment are hydraulic, fuel and pneumatic systems and components that are 
used on virtually every commercial and military airframe and engine program 
in production in the Western world today.

        The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related 
to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents 
owned by others.  In addition, patent applications on certain products are now 
pending, although there can be no assurance that patents will be issued.  The 
Company is not dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group 
of patents. 

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business
- - ---------------------------------------
        The Company's backlog at June 30, 1996 was approximately $1,330,970,000
and at June 30, 1995 was approximately $1,025,669,000.  Approximately 75% of 
the Company's backlog at June 30, 1996 is scheduled for delivery in the 
succeeding twelve months. The Company's business generally is not seasonal in 
nature.

Environmental Regulation
- - ------------------------
        The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations
designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials 
into the environment.  Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject 
to the federal "Superfund" law, under which the Company has been designated as 
a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for clean up costs 
associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency Superfund priority list.  The Company believes 
that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent
unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial 
liability to the Company.  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations
requires continuing management effort and expenditures by the Company.  
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, 
and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, material effects on 
the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.  
The information set forth in Footnote 13 to the Financial Statements contained 
on page 41 of the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year 
ended June 30, 1996 ("Annual Report") as specifically excerpted on pages 
13-30 of Exhibit 13 hereto is incorporated herein by reference.

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
- - ------------------------------------------------------------
        The Company's primary energy source for each of its business segments 
is electric power.  While the Company cannot predict future costs of such 
electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric 
power will be coal from substantial, proven reserves available to electric 
utilities.  The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to 
energy supplies both in the United States and elsewhere.  To date the Company 
has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to 
energy curtailments.

        Steel, brass, aluminum and elastomeric materials are the principal raw
materials used by the Company.  These materials are available from numerous 
sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company.

        The Company believes that its properties have been adequately 
maintained, are in good condition generally and are suitable and adequate 
for its business as presently conducted.  The extent of utilization of the 
Company's properties varies among its plants and from time to time.  
Additional capacity acquired through business combinations, offset by 
restructuring efforts in prior years, has adjusted the Company's capacity 
to proper levels for anticipated needs.  The Company's material manufacturing
facilities remain capable of handling additional volume increases.
