to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents.

- 5 -

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business

The Company’s backlog by business segment for the past two fiscal years, as set forth on pages 13-5 to 13-7 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, is incorporated into this section by reference. The Company’s backlog at June 30, 2008 was approximately $3,651,285,185 and at June 30, 2007 was approximately $2,935,232,549. Approximately 83% of the Company’s backlog
at June 30, 2008 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. The Company’s business generally is not seasonal in nature.

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations
designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject to the U.S. federal “Superfund” law, under which the Company has been designated as
a “potentially responsible party” and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list.

As of June 30, 2008, the Company is involved in environmental remediation at 33 manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the
Company and has been named as a “potentially responsible party,” along with other companies, at one off-site waste disposal facility and three regional sites.

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with
environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, material
effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.

As of June 30, 2008, the Company has a reserve
of $16,022,463 for environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable. This reserve is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the
timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of the Company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties.

The Company’s estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of $16,022,463 to a maximum of $79,633,043. The largest estimate for any one site is approximately $8,209,933. The
actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final delineation of contamination, final determination of remedial action required, negotiations with federal and state agencies with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory
requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technology, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ultimate ability of the other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or third-party recoveries.

- 6 -

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

The Company’s primary energy source for each of its business segments is electric power. While the Company cannot predict future costs of such
electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power will be coal from substantial, proven coal reserves available to electric utilities. The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies
both in the United States and elsewhere. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments.

Steel, brass, aluminum, elastomeric and thermoplastic materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used by the Company. These materials are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet
the requirements of the Company.

Employees

The Company employed 61,722 persons as of June 30, 2008, of whom approximately 31,920 were employed by foreign subsidiaries.

Business Segment Information

The Company’s net sales, segment operating income and identifiable assets by
business segment and net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area for the past three fiscal years, as set forth on pages 13-14 to 13-15 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are incorporated into this section by reference.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

During fiscal year 2008, the Company completed a number of acquisitions. The description of these transactions, as set forth on pages 13-21 to 13-22 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is incorporated into this section by
reference.

ITEM 1A

.

Risk Factors

.

The Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risk factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause actual
results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors described below are those
that the Company believes are currently the most significant. Additional risk factors not currently known to the Company or that the Company believes are immaterial also may impair the Company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

The Company is subject to risks relating to its foreign operations.

In fiscal 2008, approximately 47% of the Company’s net sales were derived from customers outside the United States. In addition, many of the
Company’s manufacturing operations and suppliers

- 7 -

are located outside the United States. The Company expects net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net
sales. The Company’s foreign operations are subject to risk in addition to those risks of its domestic operations, including:

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;

•

transportation delays and interruptions;

•

political, social and economic instability and disruptions;

•

government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;

•

the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

import and export controls;

•

labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;

•

the potential for nationalization of enterprises;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;

•

limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.

If the Company is unable to manage successfully the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, results of operations or financial condition.

Demand for and supply of the Company’s products may be adversely affected by numerous
factors, some of which the Company cannot predict or control, which would adversely affect its results of operations.

Numerous factors
may affect the demand for and supply of the Company’s products, including:

•

changes in the market acceptance of its products;

•

increased competition in the markets it serves;

•

declines in the general level of industrial production; or

•

declines in the availability or increases in the prices of raw materials.

If any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the Company’s products could suffer, which would adversely affect its results of
operations.

The Company operates in a highly competitive environment.

The Company’s domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures. To compete successfully, the Company’s Industrial Segment and Climate & Industrial Controls Segment
must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its Aerospace Segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability, quality,
delivery and service, and price competitiveness. The financial resources of certain of the Company’s competitors may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage.

- 8 -

The raw materials used in the Company’s production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject
to price and supply fluctuations that could increase its costs of products and adversely affect its results of operations.

The
Company’s supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant
increases could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and profit margins. Although the Company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time
delay between the increased raw material prices and the Company’s ability to increase the price of its products, or the Company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors.

The Company’s suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials
that they use to manufacture the component parts. As a result, the Company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. Consequently, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

The Company may face limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.

The Company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it
believes will enhance its operations and profitability. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms.

In addition, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to integrate successfully any business that it purchases into its
existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable. The successful integration of new businesses depends on the Company’s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. If the Company is unable to complete the
integration of new businesses in a timely and effective manner, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Potential product liability risks exist from the products that the Company sells.

The Company’s businesses expose it
to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that it uses or resells. Although the Company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and
adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. In the event of a claim
against it, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Moreover, even if it maintains adequate insurance, a successful claim could
still have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.

- 9 -

The Company’s future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies.

The markets the Company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and
services. The Company’s ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development or
production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Company’s competitive position.

The Company’s future growth is partly dependent on the preservation of its intellectual property.

Protecting the Company’s intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses
related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. The Company’s intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter
into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. In addition, the global nature of the Company’s business could present increased risks that the Company’s intellectual property will be
subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the United States. In such case, the Company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws
or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. Unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing
intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company’s competitive position and results of operations.

The Company may be adversely
affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject.

The Company’s operations necessitate the
use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as foreign laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the
environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to,
hazardous materials. Among other laws, the Company is subject to the United States federal “Superfund” law, under which it has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” and may be liable for clean-up costs associated
with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list. The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or
damages under environmental laws, including the Superfund law.

The Company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the
future. If more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, compliance with these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

- 10 -

The Company may be adversely affected by litigation or other regulatory proceedings.

The Company is a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of
litigation and regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of
operations.

The Company does business with the U.S. government and as such is subject to government regulations.

In addition to normal business risks, doing business with the United States government subjects the Company to unusual risks, including dependence on the
level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. Agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the
convenience of the government or for the Company’s failure to perform under the applicable contract. The Company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If the
Company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations.

Changes in the Company’s tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to
the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of
deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-United States authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from
amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company’s tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.

The amount of expenses recorded for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of
plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact the Company’s future results of
operations.

ITEM 2. Properties.

At June 30, 2008, the Company, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, had 298 manufacturing plants and 331 distribution centers and sales and administrative offices throughout the world, none of which
were individually material to its operations. The facilities are situated in 40 states within the United States and in 47 other countries throughout the rest of the world. The Company owns the majority of its manufacturing plants and distribution
centers, and its leased properties primarily consist of sales and administrative offices. The number of facilities used by each of the Company’s operating segments is summarized by type and geographic location in the tables below:

Several facilities are shared among each of the Company’s operating segments.

- 15 -

To avoid double counting, each shared facility is counted once, primarily in the Industrial Segment.

The Company believes that its properties have been adequately maintained, are in good condition generally and are suitable and adequate for its business
as presently conducted. The extent to which the Company uses its properties varies by property and from time to time. The Company’s restructuring efforts over the past several years have brought capacity levels closer to present and anticipated
needs. Most of the Company’s manufacturing facilities remain capable of handling additional volume increases.

Legal Proceedings

.

On April 27, 2007, a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida issued a subpoena to the Company’s subsidiary, Parker ITR, requiring the production of documents, in particular documents related to
communications with competitors and customers related to Parker ITR’s marine oil and gas hose business. The Company and Parker ITR substantially complied with this subpoena. On August 2, 2007, the Japan Fair Trade Commission
(“JFTC”) requested that Parker ITR submit a report to the JFTC on specific topics related to its investigation of marine hose suppliers. Parker ITR did so. The JFTC issued a final order and Parker ITR complied with that order. The European
Commission issued Requests for Information to the Company and Parker ITR, the first such request was dated May 15, 2007. The Company and Parker ITR submitted responses to these requests. The Company and Parker ITR continue to cooperate with the
European Commission. Brazilian and Korean competition authorities initiated investigations (the Brazilian investigation commenced on November 14, 2007 and the Korean investigation commenced on January 17, 2008) related to the marine hose
supply activities of Parker ITR. The Company and Parker ITR are cooperating with the Brazilian and Korean authorities.

In addition, four
class action lawsuits were filed in the Southern District of Florida:

Shipyard Supply LLC v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al

., filed May 17, 2007;

Expro Gulf Limited v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al.

, filed June 6, 2007;

Bayside Rubber & Products, Inc. v. Trelleborg Industrie S.A., et al.

, filed June 25, 2007;

Bayside Rubber & Products, Inc. v. Caleca, et al.

, filed July 12, 2007; and one in the Southern District of New
York:

Weeks Marine, Inc. v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al.

, filed July 27, 2007. The Company is named as a defendant in one case and it filed an answer in that matter. Parker ITR filed a motion to dismiss in each of the four cases in
which it is a defendant. Parker ITR’s motions to dismiss were denied as moot after all five cases were consolidated in the Southern District of Florida as 08-MDL-1888. On March 24, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action
complaint that alleges that the defendants, for a period of approximately 21 years, conspired with competitors in unreasonable restraint of trade to artificially raise, fix, maintain or stabilize prices, rig bids and allocate markets and customers
for marine oil and gas hose in the United States. Plaintiffs generally seek treble damages, a permanent injunction, attorneys’ fees, and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. The Company and Parker ITR have filed a motion to dismiss the
consolidated complaint.

On August 16, 1990, the Company publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by the Company of up to 3.0 million shares of its common stock.
From time to time, the Board of Directors has adjusted the number of shares authorized for repurchase under this program. On January 25, 2007, the Company publicly announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of
shares authorized for repurchase under this program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was equal to 10 million. On October 1, 2007, the number of shares authorized and then remaining for
repurchase under this program was adjusted to reflect the 3-shares-for-2 stock split completed on that date. There is no expiration date for this program.

ITEM 7A

.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

.

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts
and costless collar contracts, comprised of puts and calls, to reduce its exposure in both freely convertible and non-freely convertible foreign currencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company’s foreign locations enter
into various financial guarantees through financial institutions which enable customers to be reimbursed in the event of non-performance by the Company. The total carrying amount and fair value amount of open contracts and any risk to the Company as
a result of these arrangements is not material to the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

The
Company’s debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company’s objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt, thereby limiting its exposure to
changes in near-term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt by approximately $7,518,460.
