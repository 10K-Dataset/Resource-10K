of loss is considered remote. The Company does not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes. In addition, the Company's foreign
locations, in the ordinary course of business, enter into financial guarantees,
through financial institutions, which enable customers to be reimbursed in the 
event of non-performance by the Company. The total value of open contracts and
any risk to the Company as a result of these arrangements is not material to 
the Company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

of Parker-Hannifin Corporation

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our report 
dated July 30, 1998 included in the 1998 Annual Report to Shareholders of 
Parker-Hannifin Corporation (which report and consolidated financial 
statements are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) 
also included an audit of the financial statement schedule listed in Item 
14(a)(1) of this Form 10-K.  In our opinion, this financial statement schedule 
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein 
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
