Business

. Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a leading
worldwide full-line manufacturer of motion control products, including fluid power systems, electromechanical controls and related components. Fluid power involves the transfer and control of power through the medium of liquid, gas or air, in
hydraulic, pneumatic and vacuum applications. Fluid power systems move and position materials, control machines, vehicles and equipment and improve industrial efficiency and productivity. Components of a simple fluid power system include a pump or
compressor which generates pressure, valves which control the fluid's flow, an actuator which translates the pressure in the fluid into mechanical energy, a filter to insure proper fluid condition and numerous hoses, couplings, fittings and seals.
Electromechanical control involves the use of electronic components and systems to control motion and precisely locate or vary speed in automation applications. In addition to motion control products, the Company also is a leading worldwide producer
of fluid purification, fluid flow, process instrumentation, air conditioning, refrigeration, and electromagnetic shielding and thermal management products and designs and manufactures custom-engineered buildings. Also, through Wynn Oil Company and
its subsidiaries (the "Wynn's Specialty Chemical Group"), the Company develops, manufactures and markets specialty chemical products and automotive service equipment and markets vehicle service contract and product warranty programs. In
August 2001, the Company decided to suspend its efforts to sell the Wynn's Specialty Chemical Group which had previously been designated as assets held for sale since their acquisition in July 2000.

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the
environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject to the federal "Superfund" law, under which the Company has been designated as a "potentially
responsible party" and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund priority list.

As of June 30, 2001, the Company is involved in environmental remediation at 22 manufacturing
facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and has been named as a "potentially responsible party," along with other companies, at two off-site waste disposal facilities and two regional Superfund sites.

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent
unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental
laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.

As of June 30, 2001, the Company has a reserve of $17,870,000 for environmental matters which are
probable and reasonably estimable. This reserve is recorded based upon the best estimate of net costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required
by governmental authorities, the amount of the Company's liability in proportion to other responsible parties and any recoveries receivable.

The Company's estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of
$17,870,000 to a maximum of $40,782,000. The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final delineation of contamination, final determination of remedial action required, negotiations with federal and state agencies with
respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technology, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ultimate ability to pay of the other responsible parties, and any insurance or
third party recoveries.

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

The Company's primary energy source for each of its business segments is electric power. While the
Company cannot predict future costs of such electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power will be coal from substantial, proven coal reserves available to electric utilities. The Company is subject to governmental
regulations in regard to energy supplies both in the United States and elsewhere. To date the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments.

-6-

Steel, brass, aluminum, elastomeric materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used
by the Company. These materials are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 46,300 persons as of June 30, 2001, of whom approximately
17,520

were employed by foreign subsidiaries.
