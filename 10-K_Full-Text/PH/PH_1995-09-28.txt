                                       PART I

            ITEM 1.     Business.  Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a leading
worldwide full-line manufacturer of motion control products, including
fluid power systems, electromechanical controls and related components. 
Fluid power involves the transfer and control of power through the
medium of liquid, gas or air, in both hydraulic and pneumatic
applications.  Fluid power systems move and position materials, control
machines, vehicles and equipment and improve industrial efficiency and
productivity.  Components of a simple fluid power system include a pump
which generates pressure, valves which control the fluid's flow, an
actuator which translates the pressure in the fluid into mechanical
energy, a filter to remove contaminants and numerous hoses, couplings,
fittings and seals.  Electromechanical control involves the use of
electronic components and systems to control motion and precisely locate
or vary speed in automation applications.

            The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1938.  Its principal
executive offices are located at 17325 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio
44112, telephone (216) 531-3000.  As used in this Report, unless the
context otherwise requires, the term "Company" or "Parker" refers to
Parker-Hannifin Corporation and its subsidiaries.

            The Company's manufacturing, service, distribution and
administrative facilities are located in 33 states, Puerto Rico and
worldwide in 30 foreign countries.  Its motion control technology is
used in the products of its two business Segments:  Industrial and
Aerospace.  The products are sold as original and replacement equipment
through product and distribution centers worldwide.  The Company markets
its products through its direct-sales employees and more than 6,000
independent distributors.  Parker products are supplied to over a
quarter million customer outlets in virtually every major manufacturing,
transportation and processing industry.  For the fiscal year ended June
30, 1995, net sales were $3,214,370,000; Industrial Segment products
accounted for 83% of net sales and Aerospace Segment products for 17%.


Markets

            Motion control systems are used throughout industry in
applications which include moving of materials, controlling machines,
vehicles and equipment and positioning materials during the
manufacturing process.  Motion control systems contribute to the
efficient use of energy and improve industrial productivity.

            The more than a quarter million customer outlets which carry
the Company's parts are found throughout virtually every significant
manufacturing, transportation and processing industry.  No customer
accounted for more than 3% of the Company's total net sales for the
fiscal year.

            The major markets for products of the Fluid Connector, Motion

to original equipment manufacturers and their replacement markets.

            Aerospace Segment sales are made primarily to the commercial,
military and general aviation markets and are made to original equipment
manufacturers and to end users for maintenance, repair and overhaul.


Principal Products, Methods of Distribution and Competitive Conditions

            Industrial Segment.  The product lines of the Company's
Industrial Segment cover most of the components of motion control
systems.  The Fluid Connectors Group manufactures connectors, including
tube fittings and hose fittings, check valves, hoses and couplers which
transmit and contain fluid.  The Motion & Control Group manufactures
components and systems used to provide motion, control and conditioning
through the medium of pressurized fluids and electricity.  Products
include hydraulic and precision metering pumps, power units, control
valves, accumulators, cylinders, servo actuators, rotary actuators and
motors, pneumatic control valves, pressure regulators, lubricators,
hydrostatic steering components, electronic controls and systems and
automation devices.  The Automotive and Refrigeration Group manufactures
components for use in industrial, residential and automotive air
conditioning and refrigeration systems and other automotive
applications, including pressure regulators, solenoid valves, expansion
valves, filter-dryers, gerotors and hose assemblies.  The Seal Group
manufactures sealing devices, including o-rings and o-seals, gaskets and
packings which insure leak proof connections and electromagnetic
interference shielding and thermal management products.  The Filtration
Group manufactures filters to remove contaminants from fuel, air, oil,
water and other fluids in industrial, process, mobile, marine and
environmental applications.  

            Industrial Segment products include both standard items which
are produced in large quantities and custom units which are engineered
and produced to original equipment manufacturers' specifications for
application to a particular end product.  Both standard and custom
products are also used in the replacement of original motion control
system components.  Industrial Segment products are marketed primarily
through field sales employees and more than 6,000 independent
distributors.


            Aerospace Segment.  The principal products of the Company's
Aerospace Segment are hydraulic, pneumatic, and fuel systems and
components which are utilized on virtually every domestic commercial,
military and general aviation aircraft.

            Hydraulic systems and components include precision hydraulic
and electro-hydraulic systems used for precise control of rudders,
elevators, ailerons, and other

                                    - 4 -

aerodynamic control surfaces of aircraft, utility hydraulic components such as
reservoirs, accumulators, selector valves, nose wheel steering systems, engine

$22,640,000, and $16,648,000.

                                    - 5 -

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses

            The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses
related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under
patents owned by others.  In addition, patent applications on certain
products are now pending, although there can be no assurance that
patents will be issued.  The Company is not dependent to any material
extent on any single patent or group of patents.

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business

            The Company's backlog at June 30, 1995 was approximately
$1,025,669,000 and at June 30, 1994 was approximately $852,482,000. 
Approximately 79% of the Company's backlog at June 30, 1995 is scheduled
for delivery in the succeeding twelve months.  The Company's business
generally is not seasonal in nature.

Environmental Regulation

            The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and
regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the
discharge of materials into the environment.  Among other environmental
laws, the Company is subject to the federal "Superfund" law, under which
the Company has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and
may be liable for clean up costs associated with various waste sites,
some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund
priority list.  The Company believes that its policies, practices and
procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the
Company.  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires
continuing management effort and expenditures by the Company. 
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the
past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, material
effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position
of the Company.  The information set forth in Footnote 13 to the
Financial Statements contained on page 37 of the Company's Annual Report
to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 ("Annual
Report") as specifically excerpted on pages 13-31 and 13-32 of Exhibit
13 hereto is incorporated herein by reference.

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

            The Company's primary energy source for each of its business
segments is electric power.  While the Company cannot predict future
costs of such electric power, the primary source for production of the
required electric power will be coal from substantial, proven reserves. 
The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy
supplies both in the United States and elsewhere.  To date the Company
has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to
energy curtailments.

            Steel, brass, aluminum and elastomeric materials are the
principal raw materials used by the Company.  These materials are
available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the

        The Company believes that its properties have been adequately
maintained, are in good condition generally and are suitable and
adequate for its business as presently conducted.  The extent of
utilization of the Company's properties varies among its plants and from
time to time.  The Company's restructuring efforts in prior years
brought capacity levels closer to present and anticipated needs. 
Although production volume has materially increased over the last fiscal
year, most of the Company's material manufacturing facilities remain
capable of handling additional volume increases.
