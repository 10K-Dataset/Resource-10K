PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

We design, develop, and sell products and services that together
    provide our customers with high-performance network
    infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments
    for accelerating the deployment of services and applications
    over a single Internet Protocol (“IP”)-based network.
    We serve the high-performance networking requirements of global
    service providers, enterprises, governments, and research and
    education institutions that view the network as critical to
    their success. High-performance networking is designed to
    provide fast, reliable, and secure access to applications and
    services. We offer a high-performance network infrastructure
    that includes

best-in-class IP

routing, Ethernet switching, security and application
    acceleration solutions, as well as partnerships designed to
    extend the value of the network and worldwide services and
    support designed to optimize customer investments. We believe
    our open network infrastructure provides customers with greater
    choice and control in quickly meeting high-performance business
    requirements, while enabling them to reduce the total cost of
    ownership of their network infrastructure.

Our operations are organized into two reportable segments:
    Infrastructure and Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”).
    Our Infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable routing and
    switching products that are used to control and direct network
    traffic from the core, through the edge, aggregation, and the
    customer premise equipment level. Infrastructure products
    include our IP routing and carrier Ethernet routing portfolio,
    as well as our Ethernet switching portfolio. Our SLT segment
    offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customer’s
    priorities, from protecting the network itself, and protecting
    data on the network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and
    acceleration of applications across a distributed network. Both
    segments offer worldwide services, including technical support
    and professional services, as well as educational and training
    programs to our customers. Together, our high-performance
    product and service offerings help enable our customers to
    convert legacy networks that provide commoditized, best efforts
    services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation
    and value and increased performance, reliability, and security
    to end-users. See Note 11 — Segment Information
    in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for information regarding financial information regarding each
    of our Infrastructure and SLT segments, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, we
    generated net revenues of $3.57 billion and conducted
    business in more than 100 countries around the world. See
    Item 8 of Part II for more information on our
    consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007 and our consolidated results of operations, consolidated
    statements of stockholders’ equity, and consolidated
    statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2008.

We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in
    Delaware in 1998. Our corporate headquarters are located in
    Sunnyvale, California. Our website address is www.juniper.net.

Our
    Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of
    high-performance networking. We offer a high-performance network
    infrastructure that creates a responsive and trusted environment
    for accelerating the deployment of services and applications
    over a single

IP-based

network. Our strategy is designed to advance the fundamentals
    and economics of high-performance networking. Key elements of
    our strategy are described below.

Maintain
    and Extend Technology Leadership

Our
    JUNOS

®

operating system, application-specific integrated circuit
    (“ASIC”) technology, and network-optimized product
    architecture have been key elements to establishing and
    maintaining our technology leadership. We believe that these
    elements can be leveraged into future products that we are
    currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our
    technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise
    markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in
    our research and development departments, supplemented by
    external



partnerships, including strategic alliances, as well as
    acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broader range of
    products and services to customers in target markets.

Leverage
    Position as Supplier of High-Performance Network
    Infrastructure

From inception, we have focused on designing, developing, and
    building high-performance network infrastructure for demanding
    service provider and enterprise networking environments and have
    integrated purpose-built technology into a network-optimized
    architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs.
    We believe that many of these customers will deploy networking
    equipment from only a few vendors. We believe that the
    performance, reliability, and security of our products provide
    us with a competitive advantage, which is critical in gaining
    selection as one of these vendors.

Be
    Strategic to Our Customers

In developing our Infrastructure and SLT solutions, we work very
    closely with customers to design and build

best-in-class

products and solutions specifically designed to meet their
    complex needs. Over time, we have expanded our understanding of
    the escalating demands and risks facing our customers. That
    increased understanding has enabled us subsequently to design
    additional capabilities into our products. We believe our close
    relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers
    have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments
    to date. We plan to continue to work

hand-in-hand

with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as
    to design future products that meet the evolving needs of the
    marketplace, while enabling customers to reduce costs.

Enable
    New

IP-Based

Services

Our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and
    secure networks cost-effectively and deploy new differentiated
    services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than
    legacy network products. We believe that the secure delivery of

IP-based

services and applications, including IP Television
    (“IPTV”), web hosting, outsourced Internet and
    intranet services, outsourced enterprise applications, and
    voice-over IP, will continue to grow, and are cost-effectively
    enabled by our high-performance network infrastructure offerings.

Establish
    and Develop Industry Partnerships

Our customers have diverse requirements. While our products meet
    certain requirements of our customers, our products are not
    intended to satisfy certain other requirements. Therefore, we
    believe that it is important that we attract and build
    relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of
    technologies and services that extend the value of the network
    for our customers. These partnerships ensure that we have access
    to those technologies and services, whether through technology
    integration, joint development, resale, or other collaboration,
    in order to better support a broader set of our customers’
    requirements. In addition, we believe in an open network
    infrastructure that invites partner innovation and provides
    customers with greater choice and control in meeting their
    evolving business requirements, while enabling them to reduce
    costs.

Markets
    and Customers

We sell our high-performance network products and service
    offerings through direct sales and through distributors and
    value-added resellers to end-users in the following markets:

Service
    Providers

Service providers include wireline, wireless, and cable
    operators, as well as major Internet content and application
    providers. Supporting most major service provider networks in
    the world, our high-performance network infrastructure offerings
    are designed and built for the performance, reliability, and
    security that service providers demand. Our networking
    infrastructure offerings benefit these customers by:

•

Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple
    services over the same network using our high density, highly
    reliable platforms;



•

Promoting generation of additional revenues by enabling new
    services to be offered to new market segments based on our
    product capabilities;

•

Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by
    enabling consumers to self-select automatically provisioned
    service packages that provide the quality, speed, and pricing
    they desire; and

•

Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on
    investment as their networks can scale to multi-terabit rates
    based on the capabilities of our platforms.

While many of these service providers have historically been
    categorized separately as wireline, wireless, or cable
    operators, in recent years, we have seen a move towards
    convergence of these different types of service providers
    through acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships. We believe
    these strategic developments are made technically possible as
    operators invest in the build out of next generation networks
    (“NGN”) capable of supporting voice, video, and data
    traffic on to the same

IP-based

network. This convergence relies on

IP-based

traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multi-service
    networks including new service offerings such as IPTV. These new
    services offer service providers significant new revenue
    opportunities.

We believe that there are several other trends affecting service
    providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products
    and solutions. These trends include significant growth in IP
    traffic on service provider networks because of peer-to-peer
    interaction, broadband usage, video, and an increasing reliance
    on the network as a mission critical business tool in the
    strategies of our IP customers and of their enterprise customers.

The IP infrastructure market for service providers includes:
    products and technology at the network core; the network edge to
    enable access; the aggregation layer; security to protect from
    the inside out and the outside in; the application awareness and
    intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user
    needs; and the management, service awareness, and control of the
    entire infrastructure.

We have sold our products to all of the 100 largest service
    providers in the world.

Enterprise

Our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are
    designed to meet the performance, reliability, and security
    requirements of the world’s most demanding businesses. For
    this reason, enterprises, governments, and research and
    education institutions that view their networks as critical to
    their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful
    component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed
    for their leading-edge applications while:

•

Assisting in the consolidation and delivery of existing services
    and applications;

•

Accelerating the deployment of new services and applications;

•

Offering integrated security to assist in the protection and
    recovery of services and applications; and

•

Offering operational improvements that enable cost reductions,
    including lower administrative, training, customer care, and
    labor costs.

Since we first entered the market, we have sold our products to
    more than 50,000 enterprise customers.

As with the service provider market, innovation continues to be
    a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market.
    We believe that innovative enterprises view the network as
    critical to their success and therefore must build advanced
    network infrastructures that provide fast, reliable, and secure
    access to services and applications over a single

IP-based

network. These high-performance enterprises require networks
    that are global, distributed, and always available. Network
    equipment vendors need to demonstrate performance, reliability,
    and security to these customers in specific segments with

best-in-class

open solutions for maximum flexibility. We offer enterprise
    solutions and services for data centers, branch and campus
    applications, distributed and extended enterprises, and Wide
    Area Network (“WAN”) gateways.

As customers increasingly view the network as critical to their
    success, we believe that customers will increasingly demand
    fast, reliable, and secure access to services and applications
    over a single

IP-based

network. This is partly illustrated by the success of our
    Integrated Security Gateway (“ISG”) products that
    combine firewall/



virtual private network (“VPN”) and intrusion
    detection and prevention (“IDP”) solutions in a single
    platform and Secure Services Gateway (“SSG”) platforms
    that provide a mix of high-performance security with Local Area
    Network (“LAN”)/WAN connectivity for regional and
    branch office deployments. We will continue to invest to develop
    these and other converged technologies and solutions.

Our
    Products and Technology

Early in our history, we developed, marketed, and sold the first
    commercially available purpose-built IP backbone router
    optimized for the specific high-performance requirements of
    service providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to
    increase, the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the
    network was created. Our Infrastructure products are designed to
    address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as
    well as for wireless access by combining high-performance packet
    forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a
    network-optimized solution. In addition, as enterprises continue
    to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive
    internal networks, we believe the need for products with
    high-performance routing and switching technology is expanding
    to a broader set of customers, and we believe our expertise in
    this technology uniquely positions us to address this growing
    market opportunity.

Additionally, our SLT segment offers a broad family of network
    security solutions that deliver high-performance, cost-effective
    security for enterprises, service providers, and government
    entities, including integrated firewall and VPN solutions,
    secure sockets layer (“SSL”) VPN appliances, and IDP
    appliances. We also offer complementary products and
    technologies to enable our customers to provide additional

IP-based

services and enhance the performance and security of their
    existing networks and applications.

The following is an overview of our major Infrastructure and SLT
    product families:

for an analysis of net product revenues by segment.

JUNOS
    Software

In addition to our major product families, JUNOS software, our
    flagship network operating system, is a key technology element
    in our strategy to be the leader in high-performance networking.
    We believe JUNOS is fundamentally superior to other network
    operating systems in not only its design, but also in its
    development. The advantages of JUNOS include:

•

One modular operating system with single source base of code and
    a single, consistent implementation for each control plane
    feature;

•

One software release train extended through a highly disciplined
    and firmly scheduled development process; and

•

One common modular software architecture that scales across all
    JUNOS-based platforms.

JUNOS software is designed to maintain continuous systems and
    improve the availability, performance, and security of business
    applications running across the network. JUNOS software helps to
    automate network operations by providing a single consistent
    implementation of features across the network in a single
    release train that seeks to minimize the complexity, cost, and
    risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades.
    This operational efficiency allows network administrators more
    time to innovate and deliver new revenue-generating
    applications, helping to advance the economics of
    high-performance networking.

The security and stability of JUNOS software, combined with its
    modular architecture and single source code base, provides a
    foundation for delivering exceptional performance, reliability,
    security, and scale at a total cost of ownership. With an
    increasing number of our platforms able to leverage JUNOS,
    including routing, switching, and security products, we believe
    JUNOS software provides us a competitive advantage over other
    major network equipment vendors.



Customer
    Service and Support

In addition to our Infrastructure and SLT products, we offer the
    following services: 24x7x365 technical assistance, hardware
    repair and replacement parts, unspecified software updates on a

when-and-if-available

basis, professional services, and educational services. We
    deliver these services directly to end-users and utilize a
    multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our
    partners and third-party organizations, as appropriate.

We also train our channel partners in the delivery of education
    and support services to ensure locally delivered training.

As of December 31, 2008, we employed 783 people in our
    worldwide customer service and support organization. We believe
    that a broad range of support services is essential to the
    successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our
    products, and we have hired support engineers with proven
    network experience to provide those services.

Manufacturing
    and Operations

As of December 31, 2008, we employed 230 people in
    manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships
    with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and
    monitor and manage product testing and quality.

We have manufacturing relationships primarily with Celestica,
    Flextronics, and Plexus, under which we have subcontracted the
    majority of our manufacturing activity. Our manufacturing
    activity is primarily conducted in Canada, China, Malaysia,
    Mexico, and the United States.

This subcontracting activity in all locations extends from
    prototypes to full production and includes activities such as
    material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to
    our customers, and repairs. Together with our contract
    manufacturers, we design, specify, and monitor the tests that
    are required to meet internal and external quality standards.
    These arrangements provide us with the following benefits:

•

We can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey
    manufacturing and drop-shipment capabilities;

•

We gain economies of scale because, by purchasing large
    quantities of common components, our contract manufacturers
    obtain more favorable pricing than if we were buying components
    alone;

•

We operate without dedicating significant space to manufacturing
    operations; and

•

We can reduce our costs by reducing fixed overhead expenses.

Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on our
    rolling product demand forecasts. Each of the contract
    manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the
    products in our forecast and tests the products according to our
    specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors,
    value-added resellers, or end-users. Generally, we do not own
    the components and title to the products transfers from the
    contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers
    upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the
    components go unused or the products go unsold for specified
    periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete
    material charges for components that our contract manufacturers
    purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer
    orders.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers,
    those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the
    contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The
    contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a
    long-term basis.

Our ASICs are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources,
    such as IBM Corporation and Toshiba Corporation, each of whom is
    responsible for all aspects of the production of the ASICs using
    our proprietary designs.

We have five core values: trust, respect, humility, integrity,
    and excellence. These values are integral to how we manage our
    company and interact with our employees, customers, partners,
    and suppliers. By working collaboratively with our suppliers, we
    also have the opportunity to promote socially responsible
    business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide
    supply chain. To this end, we have adopted, and promote the
    adoption by



others, of the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct. The
    Electronic Industry Code of Conduct outlines standards to ensure
    that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain
    are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and
    that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.

Research
    and Development

As of December 31, 2008, we employed 3,194 people in
    our worldwide research and development organizations. Our
    research and development expenses totaled $731.2 million,
    $623.0 million and $480.3 million in the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We have
    assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience
    in the fields of high-end computing, network system design, ASIC
    design, security, routing protocols, and embedded operating
    systems. These individuals have worked in leading computer data
    networking and telecommunication companies.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are
    essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology,
    developing additional applications, incorporating that
    technology, and maintaining the competitiveness of our product
    and service offerings. In our Infrastructure and SLT products,
    we are leveraging our software and ASIC technology, developing
    additional network interfaces targeted to our customers’
    applications, and continuing to develop NGN technology to
    support the anticipated growth in IP network requirements. We
    continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve
    performance reliability and scalability, and to provide an
    enhanced user interface.

Our research and development process is driven by the
    availability of new technology, market demand, and customer
    feedback. We have invested significant time and resources in
    creating a structured process for all product development
    projects. Following an assessment of market demand, our research
    and development team develops a full set of comprehensive
    functional product specifications based on inputs from the
    product management and sales organizations. This process is
    designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the
    steps, tasks, and activities required to bring product concepts
    and development projects to market.

Sales and
    Marketing

As of December 31, 2008, we employed 2,190 people in
    our worldwide sales and marketing organizations. These sales
    employees operate in different locations around the world in
    support of our customers.

Our sales organization is organized into three geographic
    regions and within each region according to the particular needs
    in that market. Our three geographic regions are: (i) the
    Americas (including United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and
    South America), (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa
    (“EMEA”) and (iii) Asia Pacific
    (“APAC”). Within each region, there are regional and
    country teams to ensure we operate close to our customers.

See Note 11 — Segment Information in Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions
    and by significant customers, which is incorporated herein by
    reference. Our operations subject us to certain risks and
    uncertainties associated with international operations. See
    Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” for more
    information.

Our sales teams operate in their respective regions and
    generally either engage customers directly or manage customer
    opportunities through our distribution and reseller
    relationships or channels as described below. In the United
    States and Canada, we sell to several service providers directly
    and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers
    primarily through resellers. Almost all of our sales outside the
    United States and Canada are made through our channel partners.

Direct
    Sales Structure

Where we have a direct relationship with our customers, the
    terms and conditions are governed either by customer purchase
    orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase
    contracts. In instances where we have direct contracts with our
    customers, those contracts set forth only general terms of sale
    and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of
    our products. For this type of customer, our sales team engages
    directly with the customer. We directly receive and process
    customer purchase orders.



Channel
    Sales Structure

A critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our
    channel partners through which we do the majority of our
    business. We employ various channel partners, including but not
    limited to:

•

A global network of strategic distribution relationships, as
    well as region or country-specific distributors who in turn sell
    to local value added resellers who sell to the end-user
    customer. The distribution channel partners mainly sell our SLT
    products plus certain Infrastructure products that are often
    purchased by our enterprise customers. These distributors tend
    to be focused on particular regions or particular countries
    within regions. For example, we have substantial distribution
    relationships with Ingram Micro in the Americas and with NEC in
    Japan. Our agreements with these distributors are generally
    non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product discounts
    and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not
    require our distributors to purchase specified quantities of our
    products.

•

Direct value-added resellers including our strategic resellers
    referenced below, which resell our products to end-users around
    the world. These direct value-added resellers buy the products
    and services directly from us and have expertise in deploying
    complex networking solutions in their respective markets. Our
    agreements with these direct value-added resellers are generally
    non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product discounts
    and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not
    require our direct value-added resellers to purchase specified
    quantities of our products.

•

Strategic worldwide reseller relationships with Nokia-Siemens
    Networks B.V. (“NSN”), Ericsson Telekom A.B.
    (“Ericsson”), and IBM. These companies each offer
    services and products that complement, but in some cases compete
    with, our own product offerings and act as a fulfillment partner
    for our products. Our arrangements with these partners allow
    them to resell our products on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis,
    provide for product discounts, and specify other general terms
    of sale. These agreements do not require these partners to
    purchase specified quantities of our products. No single
    customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues
    in 2008. NSN accounted for greater than 10% of our total net
    revenues in 2007 and 2006.

Within each region, we employ sales professionals to assist with
    the management of our various sales channels. In addition, we
    have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly
    with the channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a
    direct relationship with our more strategic end-user customers
    while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of
    product through our channel partners.

Our sales organization is generally split between service
    provider and enterprise customers, with each separate team
    ensuring focus on the key customers in these respective markets.
    There is a structure of sales professionals, system engineers,
    and marketing and channel teams each focused on the respective
    service provider and enterprise markets.

Backlog

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under
    framework agreements with our customers. At any given time, we
    have orders for products that have not been shipped and for
    services that have not yet been performed for various reasons.
    Because we believe industry practice would allow customers to
    cancel or change orders with limited advance notice prior to
    shipment or performance, as well as our history of allowing such
    changes and cancellations, we do not consider this backlog firm
    and do not believe our backlog information is necessarily
    indicative of future revenues.

Seasonality

Many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal
    fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the
    first and third quarters. In addition, our SLT segment has
    experienced seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth
    quarter. This historical pattern should not be considered a
    reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial
    performance.



Competition

Infrastructure
    Business

In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems has
    historically been the dominant player in the market. However,
    other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade Communications
    Systems, Inc., Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Inc., Huawei
    Technologies Co., Ltd., and Nortel Networks Corporation, are
    providing competitive products in the marketplace.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco,
    Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei have significantly broader product
    lines than we do and may bundle their products with other
    networking products in a manner that may discourage customers
    from purchasing our products. In addition, consolidation among
    competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by
    competitors, can increase the competitive pressure faced by us.
    For example, in 2006 Alcatel combined with Lucent Technologies,
    Inc. and Ericsson acquired Redback Networks. In addition, many
    of our current and potential competitors have greater name
    recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be
    leveraged. Increased competition could result in price
    reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and
    loss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our
    operating results.

SLT
    Business

In the market for SLT products, Cisco generally is our primary
    competitor with its broad range of products. In addition, there
    are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines
    within SLT, including Checkpoint Software Technologies,
    Fortinet, Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Nortel, and Riverbed
    Technology, Inc. These additional competitors tend to be focused
    on single product line solutions and therefore are generally
    specialized and focused as competitors to our products. In
    addition, a number of public and private companies have
    announced plans for new products to address the same needs that
    our products address. We believe that our ability to compete
    with Cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate
    that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our
    current and potential customers.

For both product groups, we expect that, over time, large
    companies with significant resources, technical expertise,
    market experience, customer relationships, and broad product
    lines, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, will introduce new
    products, which are designed to compete more effectively in the
    market. There are also several other companies that claim to
    have products with greater capabilities than our products.
    Consolidation in this industry has begun, with one or more of
    these companies being acquired by large, established suppliers
    of network infrastructure products, and we believe it is likely
    to continue.

As a result, we expect to face increased competition in the
    future from larger companies with significantly more resources
    than we have. Although we believe that our technology and the
    purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will
    enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we cannot
    guarantee that we will be successful.

Environment

We are subject to regulations that have been adopted with
    respect to environmental matters, such as the Waste Electrical
    and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and Restriction of
    the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) regulations adopted by
    the European Union. In addition, in September 2007, we announced
    our sponsorship and continued participation in the Carbon
    Disclosure Project (“CDP”). CDP is a global
    standardized mechanism by which companies report their
    greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors. It hosts
    one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data
    in the world at www.cdproject.net. We continue to invest in the
    infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and
    measure our carbon footprint on a global basis. We believe we
    have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency
    around the world.

Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted
    for the protection of the environment has to date had no
    material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or
    competitive position.



In addition, we are committed to the environment by our effort
    in improving the energy efficiency of key elements of our
    high-performance network product offerings. For example, our
    T1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive
    products. The environment will remain a focus area across
    multiple aspects of our business.

Intellectual
    Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent
    upon our internally developed technology and expertise. Our
    operating systems were developed internally and are protected by
    United States and other copyright laws.

While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark
    law to protect our technology, we also believe that factors such
    as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new
    product developments, frequent product enhancements, and
    reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and
    maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no
    assurance that others will not develop technologies that are
    similar or superior to our technology.

In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into
    certain of our products. From time to time, we may be required
    to license additional technology from third parties to develop
    new products or product enhancements. There can be no assurance
    that third-party licenses will be available or continue to be
    available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability
    to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in
    our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses
    necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could
    require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or
    performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could
    harm our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

Our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary
    intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual
    property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be
    issued on the patent applications that we have filed, or that we
    will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property
    rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual
    property rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had 7,014 full-time
    employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we
    consider our relations with our employees to be good.
    Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense.
    We believe that our future success depends in part on our
    continued ability to hire, motivate, and retain qualified
    personnel. We believe that we have been successful in recruiting
    qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will
    continue to be successful in the future.

Our future performance depends in significant part upon the
    continued service of our key technical, sales, and senior
    management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment
    agreement requiring service for any defined period of time. The
    loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations. Our future success also
    depends on our continuing ability to attract, train, and retain
    highly qualified technical, sales, and managerial personnel.
    Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no
    assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Factors
    That May Affect Future Results

Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies
    involve significant risks. The market price of our stock has
    historically reflected a higher multiple of expected future
    earnings than many other companies. Accordingly, even small
    changes in investor expectations for our future growth and
    earnings, whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or
    operating results, changes in the mix of the products and
    services sold, acquisitions, industry changes or other factors,
    could trigger, and have triggered, significant fluctuations in
    the market price of our common stock. Investors in our
    securities should carefully consider all of the relevant
    factors, including, but not limited to, the following factors,
    that could affect our stock price.

Our
    quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to
    substantial fluctuations, and, as a result, we may fail to meet
    the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which
    could adversely affect the trading price of our common
    stock.

Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from
    quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are
    outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock
    price to fluctuate.

The factors that may affect the unpredictability of our
    quarterly results include, but are not limited to: limited
    visibility into customer spending plans, changes in the mix of
    products sold, changing market conditions, including current and
    potential customer consolidation, competition, customer
    concentration, long sales and implementation cycles, regional
    economic and political conditions and seasonality. For example,
    many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal
    fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the
    first and third quarters.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of
    operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what
    our future performance will be. It is likely that in some future
    quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of
    securities analysts or investors, in which case the price of our
    common stock may decline. Such a decline could occur, and has
    occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated
    revenues

and/or

earnings guidance.

Fluctuating
    economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a
    particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in
    costs of production may harm our operating
    results.

Our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions
    and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
    Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and
    constrained spending on network expansion have previously
    resulted, and may in the future result, in decreased revenues
    and earnings and could negatively impact our ability to forecast
    and manage our contract manufacturer relationships. In addition,
    recent turmoil in the global financial markets and associated
    economic weakness, or recession, particularly in the
    United States, as well as turmoil in the geopolitical
    environment in many parts of the world, may continue to put
    pressure on global economic conditions, which could lead to
    reduced demand for our products

and/or

higher costs of production. Economic downturns may also lead to
    longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers, an
    increase in bad debts, restructuring initiatives and associated
    expenses, and impairment of investments. Furthermore, the recent
    disruption in worldwide credit markets may adversely impact the
    ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected
    capital expenditures, which could lead to delays or
    cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services.
    In addition, our operating expenses are largely based on
    anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses
    are, and will continue to be, fixed in the short-term.
    Uncertainty about



future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast
    operating results and to make decisions about future
    investments. Future or continued economic weakness, customer
    financial difficulties, increases in costs of production, and
    reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion
    could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products
    and consequently on our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations.

A
    limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion
    of our revenues and any decrease in revenues from these
    customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and
    operating results.

A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a
    limited number of customers and distribution partners. For
    example, NSN and its predecessor companies contributed more than
    10% of revenues in the fiscal years ended 2007 and 2006. This
    customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly
    fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. Changes in
    the business requirements, vendor selection, or purchasing
    behavior of our key customers or potential new customers could
    significantly decrease sales to such customers. In addition, the
    recent disruption in worldwide credit markets may adversely
    impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their
    expected capital expenditures, which could lead to delays or
    cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services.
    Any of these factors could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, in recent years there has been consolidation in the
    telecommunications industry (for example, the acquisitions of
    AT&T Inc., MCI, Inc., and BellSouth Corporation) and
    consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications
    equipment and services (for example, the combination of Alcatel
    and Lucent, the joint venture of NSN, and the acquisition of
    Redback by Ericsson). Such consolidation may cause our customers
    who are involved in these acquisitions to suspend or
    indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have
    other unforeseen consequences that could harm our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

If we
    receive Infrastructure product orders late in a quarter, we may
    be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same
    period, which could adversely affect our quarterly
    revenues.

Generally, our Infrastructure products are not stocked by
    distributors or resellers due to their cost, complexity, and
    configurations required by our customers, and we generally build
    such products as orders are received. If orders for these
    products are received late in any quarter, we may not be able to
    build, ship, and recognize revenue for these orders in the same
    period, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our
    expected revenues for such quarter.

Telecommunications
    companies and other large companies generally require more
    onerous terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to
    sell more products to such customers, we may be required to
    agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on
    our business or ability to recognize revenues.

Telecommunications service provider companies and other large
    companies, because of their size, generally have greater
    purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received
    more favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous
    terms and conditions for their vendors. As we seek to sell more
    products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree
    to such terms and conditions, which may include terms that
    affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have
    an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations. Consolidation among such large customers
    can further increase their buying power and ability to require
    onerous terms.

For example, many customers in this class have purchased
    products from other vendors who promised certain functionality
    and failed to deliver such functionality

and/or

had
    products that caused problems or outages in the networks of
    these customers. As a result, this class of customers may
    request additional features from us and require substantial
    penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require
    substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused
    by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we
    are required to agree to them, may affect our ability to
    recognize the revenues from such sales, which may negatively
    affect our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations. For example, in April 2006, we announced that we
    would be required to defer a large amount of revenue from a
    customer due to the contractual obligations required by that
    customer.

For arrangements with multiple elements, vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered element is
    required in order to separate the components and to account for
    elements of the arrangement separately.



Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the
    price charged when the element is sold separately. However,
    customers may require terms and conditions that make it more
    difficult or impossible for us to maintain vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements to
    a similar group of customers, the result of which could cause us
    to defer the entire arrangement fees for a similar group of
    customers (product, maintenance, professional services, etc.)
    and recognize revenue only when the last element is delivered,
    or if the only undelivered element is maintenance revenue, we
    would recognize revenue ratably over the contractual maintenance
    period, which is generally one year but could be substantially
    longer.

Our
    ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner
    is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of
    the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract
    manufacturers, suppliers, or other partners, as well as
    interfaces with the systems of such third parties. If our
    systems, the systems and processes of those third parties, or
    the interfaces between them experience delays or fail, our
    business processes and our ability to build and ship products
    could be impacted, and our financial results could be
    harmed.

Some of our business processes depend upon our information
    technology systems (“IT”), the systems and processes
    of third parties, and on interfaces with the systems of third
    parties. For example, our order entry system feeds information
    into the systems of our contract manufacturers, which enable
    them to build and ship our products. If those systems fail or
    are interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished
    level or not at all. This could negatively impact our ability to
    ship products or otherwise operate our business, and our
    financial results could be harmed. For example, although it did
    not adversely affect our shipments, an earthquake in late
    December of 2006 disrupted communications with China, where a
    significant part of our manufacturing occurs.

We also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes
    of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products. If
    those systems and processes experience interruption or delay,
    our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner
    may be harmed. For example, as we have expanded our contract
    manufacturing base to China, we have experienced instances where
    our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the
    time periods expected by us. If we are not able to ship our
    products or if product shipments are delayed, our ability to
    recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be
    affected and our financial results could be harmed.

If we
    fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we
    could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays
    which would harm our business.

We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers. If we
    overestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may
    assess charges, or we may have liabilities for excess inventory,
    each of which could negatively affect our gross margins.
    Conversely, because lead times for required materials and
    components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the
    specific supplier, contract terms, and the demand for each
    component at a given time, if we underestimate our requirements,
    our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time or materials
    and components required to produce our products, which could
    increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our
    products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss
    of revenues.

We are
    dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for
    several key components, which makes us susceptible to shortages
    or price fluctuations in our supply chain, and we may face
    increased challenges in supply chain management in the
    future.

With the current demand for electronic products, component
    shortages are possible, and the predictability of the
    availability of such components may be limited. Growth in our
    business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures
    on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component
    demand and to establish optimal component levels. If shortages
    or delays persist, the price of these components may increase,
    or the components may not be available at all. We may not be
    able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of
    acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner, and
    our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources
    can be developed. For example, from time to time, including the
    first quarter of 2008, we have experienced component shortages
    that resulted in delays of product shipments. We currently
    purchase numerous key components, including ASICs, from single
    or limited sources. The development of alternate sources for
    those components



is time consuming, difficult, and costly. In addition, the lead
    times associated with certain components are lengthy and
    preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. In
    the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from
    these suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or
    second sources in a timely manner. If, as a result, we are
    unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet
    our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to
    deliver product to our customers, which would seriously affect
    present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, the development, licensing, or acquisition of new
    products in the future may increase the complexity of supply
    chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of
    key components and products would adversely affect our business.

We are
    dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have
    long-term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships,
    expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that
    could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer
    relationships.

We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of which
    is a third-party manufacturer for numerous companies) to
    manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with our
    contract manufacturers, those contracts do not require them to
    manufacture our products on a long-term basis in any specific
    quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is time
    consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional
    contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we should
    fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer
    relationships or if one or more of them should experience
    delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in our
    manufacturing operations, or if we had to change or add
    additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing
    sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be
    delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or
    contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our
    supply chain management. Moreover, an increasing portion of our
    manufacturing is performed in China and other countries and is
    therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in
    other countries. Each of these factors could adversely affect
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We
    expect gross margin to vary over time, and our recent level of
    product gross margin may not be sustainable.

Our product gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter, and
    the recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may
    be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors,
    including product mix shifts, increased price competition in one
    or more of the markets in which we compete, increases in
    material or labor costs, excess product component or
    obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers, increased
    costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred
    due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not
    accurately anticipate product demand, warranty related issues,
    or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets
    with different pricing and cost structures.

The
    long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well
    as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place
    large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues and
    operating results to vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter.

A customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products
    involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy
    evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the
    sales cycle may be lengthy. In particular, customers making
    critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of
    large or next-generation networks may engage in very lengthy
    procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future
    orders. Throughout the sales cycle, we may spend considerable
    time educating and providing information to prospective
    customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even
    after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our
    products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary
    widely and depends on the skill set of the customer, the size of
    the network deployment, the complexity of the customer’s
    network environment, and the degree of hardware and operating
    system configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers
    with large networks usually expand their networks in large
    increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive
    purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular
    basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation



that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with
    short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to
    vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.

We are
    a party to lawsuits, which are costly to investigate and defend
    and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay
    damages or prevent us from taking certain actions, any or all of
    which could harm our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations.

We and certain of our current and former officers and current
    and former members of our Board of Directors are subject to
    various lawsuits. For example, we have been served with lawsuits
    related to the alleged backdating of stock options and other
    related matters, a description of which can be found in
    Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies in Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

under the heading “Legal Proceedings.” There can be no
    assurance that these or any actions that have been or may be
    brought against us will be resolved in our favor. Regardless of
    whether they are resolved in our favor, these lawsuits are, and
    any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely
    be, expensive and time consuming to investigate, defend, settle,

and/or

resolve. Such costs of investigation and defense, as well as any
    losses resulting from these claims or settlement of these
    claims, could significantly increase our expenses and could harm
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, we are party to a lawsuit which seeks to enjoin us
    from granting equity awards under our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan
    (the “2006 Plan”), as well as to invalidate all awards
    granted under such plan to date. The 2006 Plan is the only
    active plan under which we currently grant stock options and
    restricted stock units to our employees. If this lawsuit is not
    resolved in our favor, we may be prevented from using the 2006
    Plan to provide these equity awards to recruit new employees or
    to compensate existing employees, which would put us at a
    significant disadvantage to other companies that compete for
    workers in high technology industries such as ours. Accordingly,
    our ability to hire, retain, and motivate current and
    prospective employees would be harmed, the result of which could
    negatively impact our business operations.

We
    sell our products to customers that use those products to build
    networks and IP infrastructure and, if the demand for network
    and IP systems does not continue to grow, then our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations could be
    adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on
    the growth of secure IP infrastructure and on the deployment of
    our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of
    IP services. As a result of changes in the economy and capital
    spending or the building of network capacity in excess of
    demand, all of which have in the past particularly affected
    telecommunications service providers, spending on IP
    infrastructure can vary, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations. In addition, a number of our existing customers are
    evaluating the build out of their NGNs. During the decision
    making period when the customers are determining the design of
    those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use
    in those networks, such customers may greatly reduce or suspend
    their spending on secure IP infrastructure. Such pauses in
    purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from
    such customers, can cause fluctuations in the level of spending
    by these customers and, even where our products are ultimately
    selected, can have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

If we
    do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products
    and product enhancements that meet those needs, or if those
    products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to
    compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will
    suffer.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future
    market needs or be able to develop new products or product
    enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely
    manner. If we fail to anticipate market requirements or to
    develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to
    meet those needs in a timely manner, such failure could
    substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of
    our present and future products, which would significantly harm
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
    Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially
    introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no
    assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve
    widespread market acceptance. For example, in the first quarter
    of 2008, we announced new products designed to address the
    Ethernet switching market, a market in which we had not



had a historical presence. If these new products do not gain
    market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth, our ability to
    meet future financial targets may be adversely affected. Any
    failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could
    adversely affect our business and financial results.

We
    rely on value-added resellers and distribution partners to sell
    our products, and disruptions to, or our failure to effectively
    develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes
    and procedures that support it could adversely affect our
    ability to generate revenues from the sale of our
    products.

Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and
    maintaining successful relationships with a variety of
    value-added reseller and distribution partners. The majority of
    our revenues are derived through value-added resellers and
    distributors, most of which also sell competitors’
    products. Our revenues depend in part on the performance of
    these partners. The loss of or reduction in sales to our
    value-added resellers or distributors could materially reduce
    our revenues. For example, in April 2007, our largest customer,
    Siemens, transferred its telecommunications business to a joint
    venture between Siemens and Nokia. Our competitors may in some
    cases be effective in providing incentives to current or
    potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or
    to prevent or reduce sales of our products. If we fail to
    maintain relationships with our partners, fail to develop new
    relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new
    markets, or expand the number of distributors and resellers in
    existing markets, fail to manage, train or motivate existing
    value-added resellers and distributors effectively or if these
    partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our
    products may decrease, and our business, financial condition,
    and results of operations would suffer.

In addition, we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a
    sell-through model using information provided by our
    distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate
    or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues
    could be adversely impacted.

Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution
    channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and
    procedures that support it, and those processes and procedures
    may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to
    manage. Our failure to successfully manage and develop our
    distribution channel and the processes and procedures that
    support it could adversely affect our ability to generate
    revenues from the sale of our products.

We
    face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and
    adversely affect our financial results.

Competition is intense in the markets that we address. The IP
    infrastructure market has historically been dominated by Cisco
    with other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade, Ericsson,
    Extreme Networks, Huawei, and Nortel providing products to a
    smaller segment of the market. In addition, a number of other
    small public and private companies have products or have
    announced plans for new products to address the same challenges
    and markets that our products address.

In the SLT market, we face intense competition from a broader
    group of companies including appliance vendors such as Cisco,
    Fortinet, F5 Networks, Nortel, Riverbed, and software vendors
    such as CheckPoint. In addition, a number of other small public
    and private companies have products or have announced plans for
    new products to address the same challenges and markets that our
    products address.

In addition, actual or speculated consolidation among
    competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by
    competitors, can increase the competitive pressures faced by us.
    In this regard, Alcatel combined with Lucent in 2006, and
    Ericsson acquired Redback in 2007. A number of our competitors
    have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range
    of products and services for the overall network equipment
    market than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully
    against existing and future competitors on the basis of product
    offerings or price, we could experience a loss in market share
    and revenues

and/or

be
    required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins,
    and which could materially and adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.



Our
    success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage
    our resources and restructure our business through rapidly
    fluctuating economic and market conditions.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a
    rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning,
    forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively
    scale our business and adjust our business in response to
    fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. In periods of
    market expansion, we have increased investment in our business
    by, for example, increasing headcount and increasing our
    investment in research and development and other parts of our
    business. Conversely, during 2001 and 2002, in response to
    downward trending industry and market conditions, we
    restructured our business and reduced our workforce. Many of our
    expenses, such as real estate expenses, cannot be rapidly or
    easily adjusted because of fluctuations in our business or
    numbers of employees. Moreover, rapid changes in the size of our
    workforce could adversely affect the ability to develop and
    deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability
    to realize our current or future business objectives.

We are
    currently implementing upgrades to key internal systems and
    processes, and problems with the design or implementation of
    these systems and processes could interfere with our business
    and operations.

In 2007, we initiated a project to upgrade certain key internal
    systems and processes, including our company-wide human
    resources management system, our customer relationship
    management (“CRM”) system and enterprise resource
    planning (“ERP”) system. We have invested, and will
    continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in
    the design and implementation of these systems and processes,
    which may be disruptive to our underlying business. Any
    disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the
    new systems or processes, particularly any disruptions or delays
    that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability
    to process customer orders, ship products, provide service and
    support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill
    contractual obligations, record and transfer information in a
    timely and accurate manner, file SEC reports in a timely manner,
    or otherwise run our business. Even if we do not encounter these
    adverse effects, the design and implementation of these new
    systems and processes may be much more costly than we
    anticipated. If we are unable to successfully design and
    implement these new systems and processes as planned, or if the
    implementation of these systems and processes is more costly
    than anticipated, our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations could be negatively impacted.

Litigation
    or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be time
    consuming, expensive and require a significant amount of
    resources to prosecute, defend, or make our products
    non-infringing.

Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims
    or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark,
    and other intellectual property rights to technologies and
    related standards that are relevant to our products. The
    asserted claims

and/or

initiated litigation may include claims against us or our
    manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of
    their proprietary rights with respect to our products.
    Regardless of the merit of these claims, they have been and can
    be time consuming, result in costly litigation, and may require
    us to develop non-infringing technologies or enter into license
    agreements. Furthermore, because of the potential for high
    awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily
    predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled
    for significant amounts of money. If any infringement or other
    intellectual property claim made against us by any third party
    is successful, if we are required to settle litigation for
    significant amounts of money, or if we fail to develop
    non-infringing technology or license required proprietary rights
    on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

We are
    subject to risks arising from our international
    operations.

We derive a majority of our revenues from our international
    operations, and we plan to continue expanding our business in
    international markets in the future. As a result of our
    international operations, we are affected by economic,
    regulatory, and political conditions in foreign countries,
    including changes in general IT spending, the imposition of
    government controls, changes or limitations in trade protection
    laws, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws, natural
    disasters, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions,
    misappropriation of intellectual property, acts of terrorism,
    and continued unrest in many regions and other factors, which
    could have a material



impact on our international revenues and operations. In
    particular, in some countries, we may experience reduced
    intellectual property protection. Moreover, local laws and
    customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the
    United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those
    with developing economies, it is common for others to engage in
    business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies
    and procedures or United States regulations applicable to us.
    Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure
    compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no
    assurance that none of our employees, contractors, and agents
    will take actions in violation of them. Violations of laws or
    key control policies by our employees, contractors, or agents
    could result in financial reporting problems, fines, penalties,
    or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products
    and could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our
    financial condition and results of operations could suffer if
    there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other
    intangible assets with indefinite lives.

We are required to test annually and review on an interim basis,
    our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives,
    including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any
    future acquisitions, to determine if impairment has occurred. If
    such assets are deemed impaired, an impairment loss equal to the
    amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of
    the assets would be recognized. This would result in incremental
    expenses for that quarter, which would reduce any earnings or
    increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was
    determined to have occurred. For example, such impairment could
    occur if the market value of our common stock falls below
    certain levels for a sustained period, or if the portions of our
    business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at
    expected rates or decline. In the second quarter of 2006, our
    impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of
    $1,280.0 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our
    balance sheet for the SLT operating segment, primarily due to
    the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a
    period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment
    review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted
    future cash flows used in the income approach. Recently, the
    turmoil in credit markets and the broader economy has
    contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global
    stock markets that have reduced the market price of many
    technology company stocks, including ours. Further declines in
    our stock price or the failure of our stock price to recover
    from previous declines, as well as any marked decline in our
    level of revenues or gross margins, increase the risk that
    goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future
    periods. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of
    any impairment of assets.

Changes
    in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from
    examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely
    affect our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or
    adversely affected by: earnings being lower than anticipated in
    countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than
    anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory
    rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets
    and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the research and
    development (“R&D”) tax credit laws; by transfer
    pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions including
    the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany
    R&D cost sharing arrangement; by tax effects of stock-based
    compensation; by costs related to intercompany restructurings;
    or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles,
    or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the
    continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal
    Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We
    regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
    from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
    provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the
    outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations.

We are
    exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could
    negatively affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the
    United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in

non-U.S. currency

exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business
    practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

The majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in
    U.S. Dollars. We also have some transactions that are
    denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound,
    the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen



related to our sales and service operations outside of the
    United States. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar
    could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in
    those markets outside the United States in which we sell in
    U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could
    increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of
    raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in
    foreign currencies.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated
    with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional
    currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign
    currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are
    intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. However,
    no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances,
    including long-term declines in the value of the
    U.S. Dollar. If our attempts to hedge against these risks
    are not successful, or if long-term declines in the value of the
    U.S. Dollar persist, our financial condition and results of
    operations could be adversely impacted.

If we
    fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control
    and reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and
    grow our business will be negatively affected.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our
    business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an
    effective planning and management process. We will need to
    continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our
    reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business
    effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement
    improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our
    business, financial condition, and results of operations may be
    negatively affected.

Our
    ability to develop, market, and sell products could be harmed if
    we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
    retain the services of executive, engineering, sales and
    marketing, and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified
    individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized
    technical areas, or sales people specializing in the service
    provider and enterprise markets, is limited and competition for
    such individuals is intense. None of our officers or key
    employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific
    term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the
    inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays
    in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers and sales
    people, and the complexity and time involved in replacing or
    training new employees, could delay the development and
    introduction of new products, and negatively impact our ability
    to market, sell, or support our products.

Our
    products are highly technical and if they contain undetected
    errors, our business could be adversely affected and we may need
    to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged
    or actual failure of our products and services.

Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to
    the operation of many networks, and, in the case of our security
    products, provide and monitor network security and may protect
    valuable information. Our products have contained and may
    contain one or more undetected errors, defects, or security
    vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be
    discovered after a product has been installed and used by
    end-customers. Any errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities
    discovered in our products after commercial release could result
    in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of
    customers, loss of future business, and increased service and
    warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, in
    the event an error, defect, or vulnerability is attributable to
    a component supplied by a third-party vendor, we may not be able
    to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that
    we may incur. In addition, we could face claims for product
    liability, tort, or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit,
    regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert
    management’s attention. In addition, if our business
    liability insurance coverage is inadequate, or future coverage
    is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial
    condition and results of operations could be harmed.



A
    breach of network security could harm public perception of our
    security products, which could cause us to lose
    revenues.

If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in
    the network of a customer of our security products, regardless
    of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the
    market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be
    harmed. This could cause us to lose current and potential
    end-customers or cause us to lose current and potential
    value-added resellers and distributors. Because the techniques
    used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change
    frequently and generally are not recognized until launched
    against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these
    techniques.

If our
    products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks,
    installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our
    business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’
    existing networks, each of which have different specifications
    and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other
    vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple
    generations of products that have been added over time as these
    networks have grown and evolved. Our products will be required
    to interoperate with many or all of the products within these
    networks as well as future products in order to meet our
    customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing
    software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’
    networks, we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix
    or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate
    and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could
    be costly and negatively affect our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our
    products do not interoperate with those of our customers’
    networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected or
    orders for our products could be cancelled. This could hurt our
    operating results, damage our reputation, and seriously harm our
    business and prospects.

Governmental
    regulations affecting the import or export of products could
    negatively affect our revenues.

The United States and various foreign governments have imposed
    controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the
    import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
    technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental
    agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption
    technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental
    recovery of private encryption keys. Governmental regulation of
    encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or
    our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our
    products, could harm our international and domestic sales and
    adversely affect our revenues. In addition, failure to comply
    with such regulations could result in penalties, costs, and
    restrictions on export privileges.

Integration
    of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our
    business and harm our financial condition and stock price and
    may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.

We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to
    enhance our business. In 2005, we completed the acquisitions of
    five private companies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
    including problems combining the purchased operations,
    technologies or products, unanticipated costs, diversion of
    management’s attention from our core businesses, adverse
    effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
    customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we
    have no or limited prior experience, and potential loss of key
    employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    integrate successfully any businesses, products, technologies,
    or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of
    businesses that we have acquired has been, and will continue to
    be, a complex, time consuming, and expensive process.
    Acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that
    dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders, assume
    liabilities, record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets
    that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis
    and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization
    expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large
    and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related
    expenses, all of which could harm our financial condition and
    results of operations.

In addition, if we fail in our acquisition integration efforts
    with respect to our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently
    operate as a combined organization utilizing common information
    and communication systems,



operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources
    practices, our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations may be adversely affected.

Due to
    the global nature of our operations, economic or social
    conditions or changes in a particular country or region could
    adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses,
    which could have a material adverse impact on our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

We conduct significant sales and customer support operations
    directly and indirectly through our distributors and value-added
    resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the
    operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are
    located inside and outside of the United States. In addition,
    our research and development and our general and administrative
    operations are conducted in the United States as well as other
    countries. Accordingly, our future results could be materially
    adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing
    factors including, among others, political or social unrest,
    natural disasters, epidemic disease, war, or economic
    instability in a specific country or region, trade protection
    measures, and other regulatory requirements which may affect our
    ability to import or export our products from various countries,
    service provider, and government spending patterns affected by
    political considerations and difficulties in staffing and
    managing international operations. Any or all of these factors
    could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

Our
    products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party
    technology, and if licenses of third-party technology do not
    continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our
    revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could
    be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our
    products. From time to time, we may be required to license
    additional technology from third parties to develop new products
    or product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be
    available or continue to be available to us on commercially
    reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any
    third-party licenses required in our products or our inability
    to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products
    and product enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute
    technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a
    greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

Matters
    related to the investigation into our historical stock option
    granting practices and the restatement of our financial
    statements have resulted in litigation and regulatory
    proceedings, and may result in additional litigation or other
    possible government actions.

Our historical stock option granting practices and the
    restatement of our consolidated financial statements have
    exposed us to risks such as litigation, regulatory proceedings,
    and government enforcement actions. For more information
    regarding our current litigation and related inquiries, please
    see Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies in
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

under the heading “Legal Proceedings” as well as the
    other risk factors related to litigation set forth in this
    section. We have provided the results of our internal review and
    independent investigation to the SEC and the United States
    Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California,
    and in that regard, we have responded to formal and informal
    requests for documents and additional information. In August
    2007, we announced that we entered into a settlement agreement
    with the SEC in connection with our historical stock option
    granting practices in which we consented to a permanent
    injunction against any future violations of the antifraud,
    reporting,

books-and-records

and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.
    This settlement concluded the SEC’s formal investigation of
    the Company with respect to this matter. In addition, while we
    believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining
    the correct measurement dates for our stock option grants, the
    SEC may disagree with the manner in which we accounted for and
    reported, or did not report, the corresponding financial impact.
    We are also subject to civil litigation related to the stock
    option matters. No assurance can be given regarding the outcomes
    from litigation or other possible government actions. The
    resolution of these matters will be time consuming, expensive,
    and may distract management from the conduct of our business.
    Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation
    or if we enter into any settlements related thereto, we could be
    required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies
    imposed, which could harm our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations.



While
    we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, we are exposed to risks from legislation
    requiring companies to evaluate those internal
    controls.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our
    management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest
    to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and
    process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these
    requirements. We have and will continue to incur significant
    expenses and devote management resources to Section 404
    compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that our chief
    executive officer, chief financial officer, or independent
    registered public accounting firm determine in the future that,
    our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective
    as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions may be
    adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price
    of our stock.

Regulation
    of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating
    results and future prospects.

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our
    business and financial condition could be adversely affected by
    changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications
    industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that
    apply directly to access to or commerce on IP networks. We could
    be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce
    in any country where we operate. Such regulations could address
    matters such as voice over the Internet or using IP, encryption
    technology, and access charges for service providers. In
    addition, regulations have been adopted with respect to
    environmental matters, such as the WEEE and RoHS regulations
    adopted by the European Union, as well as regulations
    prohibiting government entities from purchasing security
    products that do not meet specified local certification
    criteria. Compliance with such regulations may be costly and
    time-consuming for us and our suppliers and partners. The
    adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease
    demand for our products, and at the same time could increase the
    cost of building and selling our products as well as impact our
    ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize
    revenue in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

The
    investment of our cash balance and our investments in government
    and corporate debt securities are subject to risks, which may
    cause losses and affect the liquidity of these
    investments.

At December 31, 2008, we had $2,019.1 million in cash
    and cash equivalents and $274.3 million in short- and
    long-term investments. We have invested these amounts primarily
    in U.S. government securities, corporate notes and bonds,
    commercial paper, and money market funds meeting certain
    criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general
    credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be
    exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have
    affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused
    credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with
    our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on
    our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Uninsured
    losses could harm our operating results.

We self-insure against many business risks and expenses, such as
    intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit
    programs, where we believe we can adequately self-insure against
    the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either
    not deemed cost-effective or is not available. We also maintain
    a program of insurance coverage for various types of property,
    casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with
    various carriers in numerous jurisdictions. The types and
    amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and
    from location to location, depending on availability, cost, and
    our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are
    subject to deductibles, policy limits, and exclusions that
    result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance
    basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and
    unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations.

In July 2006 and February 2007, our Board of Directors (the
    “Board”) approved a stock repurchase program (the
    “2006 Stock Repurchase Program”). This program
    authorized us to purchase up to a total of $2.0 billion of
    our common stock. In addition, during March 2008, the Board
    approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2008 Stock
    Repurchase Program”) which authorized us to purchase up to
    $1.0 billion of our common stock. This new program is in
    addition to the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program. During the three
    months ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased and retired
    2,436,290 shares of common stock at an average price of
    $17.45 per share, under the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program. Under
    the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program and the 2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program, we repurchased and retired common stock of 15,359,852
    shares at an average price of $24.53 per share and 9,728,374
    shares at an average price of $23.43 per share, respectively,
    during 2008. All shares of common stock purchased under the 2006
    and 2008 Stock Repurchase Programs have been retired. As of
    December 31, 2008, the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program has no
    remaining authorized funds. Future share repurchases under the
    2008 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the
    circumstances in place at the time and will be made from time to
    time in private transactions or open market purchases as
    permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. This
    program may be discontinued at any time.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Report”), including the “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations”, contains forward-looking statements regarding
    future events and the future results of Juniper Networks, Inc.
    (the “Company”) that are based on current
    expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the
    industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of
    our management. Words such as ’expects,’
    ’anticipates,’ ’targets,’ ’goals,’
    ’projects,’ ’intends,’ ’plans,’
    ’believes,’ ’seeks,’ ’estimates,’
    variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended
    to identify such forward-looking statements. These
    forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject
    to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to
    predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and
    adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking
    statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such
    differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in
    this Report under the section entitled “Risk Factors”
    in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other
    reports we file with the SEC, specifically the most recent
    reports on

Form 10-Q.

While forward-looking statements are our best prediction at the
    time that they are made, you should not rely on them. We
    undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any
    forward-looking statements for any reason.

The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated
    Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which
    have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. In the course of operating our
    business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the
    payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the
    manufacturing, and shipment of products, the fulfillment of
    orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory
    and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions
    has some impact on the financial results for any given period.
    In making these decisions, we consider various factors including
    contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition,
    internal and external financial targets and expectations, and
    financial planning objectives. The preparation of these
    financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
    that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
    revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies.
    On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
    related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs,
    allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets,
    especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer
    exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges,
    assumptions used in the valuation of stock-based compensation,
    and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience
    and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
    reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
    the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
    assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions.

To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods
    covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview
    and a summary of the significant events that affected the most
    recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our
    operating expenses. These sections should be read in conjunction
    with the more detailed



discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition
    and results of operations in this Item 7, our “Risk
    Factors” section included in Item 1A of Part I,
    and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes
    included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.

Executive
    Overview

Our 2008 performance was the result of a combination of strong
    market demand for networking and security products as well as
    our focused execution and market share gains. In addition, we
    began shipment of several new products, which contributed to our
    revenue growth during the year. While revenue growth was
    substantial, towards the end of 2008 worldwide economic
    conditions, in particular the slowdown in the U.S., led to
    slowing rates of growth and reduced our visibility into future
    periods. During 2008, we continued implementation of a series of
    operational excellence initiatives. These initiatives are
    intended to strengthen the management systems and processes
    throughout our organization to support our growth and to improve
    operational efficiency and contain costs in the face of
    difficult economic and market conditions.

Net Revenues:

Our net revenues increased in
    2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the growing acceptance
    of our router and firewall products and services in the service
    provider and enterprise markets. We experienced growth in both
    product and service revenues, which represented 81.5% and 18.5%,
    respectively, of our total net revenues in 2008. Product
    revenues increased $584.0 million, or 25%, to
    $2,911.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007. Service revenues
    increased $152.3 million, or 30%, to $661.4 million in
    2008 compared to 2007. Net revenues increased in each of our
    three geographic regions in 2008 compared to 2007.

•

Operating Income:

Our operating income as well
    as operating margin as a percentage of net revenues increased in
    2008 compared to 2007. These increases were, in large part, due
    to the growth in revenues and a decrease in operating expense as
    a percentage of net revenues, which was attributable to our
    efforts to better manage expenses and improve efficiencies in
    2008 compared to 2007. In our effort to manage our expenses, we
    expanded our R&D headcount in regions with lower operating
    costs.

•

Net Income and Net Income Per Share:

The
    increase in net income and net income per share in 2008 compared
    to 2007, is primarily due to the increase in operating income,
    which resulted from the growth in revenues, and the reduction in
    operating expense as a percentage of net revenues, which is
    attributable to a decrease in the amortization of purchased
    intangible assets and the implementation of certain cost
    reduction initiatives compared to 2007. The increase in
    operating income was partially offset by lower net interest and
    other income primarily due to lower interest rates along with
    higher income tax expense in 2008.

•

Other Financial Highlights:

Total deferred
    revenue increased $77.0 million in 2008, primarily due to
    the growth in our installed equipment base for maintenance and
    customer support contracts. In 2008, we generated a net increase
    of $303.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, primarily
    resulting from $875.2 million in cash provided by our
    operating activities, which was offset by the repurchase of
    $604.7 million of our common stock.



Significant
    Events

Business
    and Market Environment

We design, develop, and sell products and services that together
    provide our customers with high-performance network
    infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments
    for accelerating the deployment of services and applications
    over a single

IP-based

network. We serve the high-performance networking requirements
    of global service providers, enterprises, governments, and
    research and education institutions that view the network as
    critical to their success. High-performance networking is
    designed to provide fast, reliable, and secure access to
    applications and services at scale. We offer a high-performance
    network infrastructure that includes IP routing, Ethernet
    switching, security, and application acceleration solutions, as
    well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network
    and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer
    investments.

In 2008, we continued to deliver new and innovative,
    high-performance network infrastructure solutions. We entered
    the enterprise switching market, through the introduction of the
    EX-series, a family of Ethernet switches that leverage the
    operational simplicity and carrier-class reliability of our
    JUNOS software. We also introduced a new category of extensible
    networking and security products with our SRX series dynamic
    services gateways. In addition, we introduced a new family of
    IDP appliances that deliver up to 10 Gigabits per second
    real-world throughput and performance to enable deployments in
    the network core, the integration of services, including
    Firewall and chassis clustering, into JUNOS software for
    implementation on the J-series services router and the Security
    Threat Response Manager (“STRM”), a platform capable
    of providing businesses with a centralized scalable and
    effective way to log and manage a rapidly evolving threat
    landscape. We also announced an advanced mobile IP/Multi
    Protocol Label Switching (“MPLS”) solution portfolio
    with the new BX 7000 multi-access gateway router for the cell
    site, M-series circuit emulation physical interface cards for
    the aggregation site, and a suite of software features designed
    to simplify deployment, provisioning and management of mobile
    backhaul networks. In addition, we introduced the JCS 1200, a
    dedicated high-performance control plane scaling platform.

We also delivered new enhancements to existing solutions to help
    customers maximize their network infrastructure investments and
    lower their overall total cost of ownership. We expanded our
    Network and Security Manager (“NSM”) to deliver a
    centralized management solution for routing, security, and
    switching, enabling customers to consolidate and simplify the
    management of their network infrastructure. We announced
    enhancements to our Access Control Solution, to deliver enhanced
    scalability and performance, with centralized access policy
    management via NSM, helping customers cost effectively achieve
    comprehensive network visibility with broad enforcement
    capabilities. We introduced the next generation of our WXC
    application acceleration platforms to deliver a more scalable,
    modular, and cost-effective approach to delivering fast and
    consistent application response across the WAN. In addition, we
    announced three new line card families for the
    MX-series Ethernet Services Routers.

In 2008, the growing weakness of the global economy, and in the
    United States in particular, has affected the purchasing
    behavior of our customers and led to lower revenue growth in our
    fourth quarter compared to previous quarters, delays in purchase
    decisions, and reduced visibility regarding future business. If
    economic growth in the United States and other countries’
    economies continues to decline

and/or

fail
    to recover, our customers may delay or reduce their purchases.
    This could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer
    sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased
    price competition. In 2009, we will continue to invest in key
    research and development projects that we believe will lead to
    future growth while at the same time containing other costs and
    allocating resources effectively.

Japan
    Distributor Audit

In December 2008, during the course of our performance of
    routine distributor audits, we became aware of facts that caused
    us to question the accuracy of point of sale reports of a few
    distributors in Japan with respect to a small number of
    transactions. As a result, we commenced a review of revenue from
    sales through distributors in Japan, which was completed prior
    to the filing of this report. As a result of this review, we
    deferred $3.0 million of revenue for sales through
    distributors in Japan. Total revenues through distributors in
    Japan, after the $3.0 million deferral, were approximately
    $53.0 million in 2008 and approximately $13.0 million
    in the three months ended December 31, 2008. For financial
    data for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, which
    incorporates the results of



this review, please see Note 13 — Selected
    Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) in Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this
    Annual report on

Form 10-K.

Stock
    Repurchase Activity

In 2008, we repurchased $604.7 million, or
    25.1 million share of common stock, under the following two
    stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors
    (the “Board”).

Under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved in
    2006 and 2007 (the “2006 Stock Repurchase Program”),
    we repurchased approximately 15.4 million shares of our
    common stock at an average price of $24.53 per share for a total
    purchase price of $376.8 million in 2008. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had repurchased and retired
    approximately 84.8 million shares of our common stock under
    the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program at an average price of $23.58
    per share. The program has no remaining authorized funds
    available for future stock repurchases.

The Board approved a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program
    in March 2008 (the “2008 Stock Repurchase Program”).
    Under this program, we repurchased approximately
    9.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price
    of $23.43 per share for a total purchase price of
    $227.9 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the
    2008 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of
    $772.1 million. See Note 14 — Subsequent
    Events in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2009.

Nature of
    Expenses

Most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain operations
    are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers.
    Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments
    to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard
    product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce
    our products using design specifications, quality assurance
    programs, and standards that we establish. Controls around
    manufacturing, engineering, and documentation are conducted at
    our facilities in Sunnyvale, California, and Westford,
    Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have
    facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and the
    United States. We generally do not own the components and title
    to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and
    immediately to our customers upon shipment.

The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build
    forecasts, and if actual component usage is lower than our
    forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for
    carrying or obsolete material charges.

In recent years, an increasing amount of our products have been
    manufactured in Asia, and we anticipate that a larger percentage
    of our products will be produced outside the United States and
    Canada in the future. Our contracts generally provide for
    passage of title and risk of loss at the designated point of
    shipment to the customer. The manufacturing of products in Asia
    for shipment to customers in EMEA and the Americas resulted in
    additional shipment logistics, freight and timing issues for us
    and those customers. In an ongoing effort to balance our and the
    customers’ needs, we have made changes on occasion to the
    payment of freight and the point of shipment with respect to
    products shipped from Asia. These changes impact shipping costs
    and the timing of revenue recognition of the affected shipments.

We have employees in our manufacturing and operations
    organization who manage relationships with our contract
    manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product
    testing and quality.

Employee-related costs have historically been the primary driver
    of our operating expenses, and we expect this trend to continue.
    Employee-related costs include items such as wages, commissions,
    bonuses, vacation, benefits, stock-based compensation, and
    travel. We had 7,014, 5,879, and 4,833 employees as of
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The
    year-over-year increases were primarily attributable to
    increases in our research and development and sales and
    marketing organizations. Our headcount is expected to remain
    flat in 2009 as we continue our cost reduction activities. We
    accounted for stock-based compensation under the fair value
    approach of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”), in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Details
    of our stock-based compensation expense are described in
    Note 10 — Employee



Benefit Plans in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Facility and information technology departmental costs are
    allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount,
    respectively. These departmental costs have increased in 2008,
    2007, and 2006 due to increases in headcount and facility leases
    resulting from infrastructure systems added to support our
    growth and past acquisitions. Facility and information
    technology related headcount was 267, 224, and 177 as of
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In 2009,
    we expect to continue to invest in our company-wide information
    technology infrastructure as we implement our operational
    excellence initiatives.

Our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars as
    well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound,
    the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Changes in related
    currency exchange rates may affect our operating results.
    Periodically, we use foreign currency forward

and/or

option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to operating expenses. The effective
    portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially
    reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), and, upon occurrence of the forecasted
    transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the appropriate
    line item of the consolidated statement of operations to which
    the hedged transaction relates. Any ineffectiveness of the
    hedging instruments is reported in other income (expense) on our
    consolidated statements of operations. The increase in operating
    expenses including research and development, sales and
    marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses, due
    to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1% in 2008.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures
    in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and
    estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We base our
    estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical
    experience, and various other factors that we believe are
    reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Note 1 — Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

describes the significant accounting policies and methods used
    in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
    critical accounting policies described below are significantly
    affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting
    policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and
    estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and actual results could differ materially from the
    amounts reported based on these policies. To the extent there
    are material differences between our estimates and the actual
    results, our future results of operations may be affected.

•

Revenue Recognition.

Our products are
    generally integrated with software that is essential to the
    functionality of our equipment. Additionally, we provide
    unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated
    software through our maintenance contracts for most of our
    products. Accordingly, we account for revenue in accordance with
    Statement of Position

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition,

and all related
    interpretations.

Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have
    been met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists.

We generally rely upon sales contracts,
    or agreements and customer purchase orders to determine the
    existence of an arrangement.

•

Delivery has occurred.

We use shipping terms
    and related documents or written evidence of customer
    acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance.
    In instances where we have outstanding obligations related to
    product delivery or the final acceptance of the product, revenue
    is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have
    been met.

•

Sales price is fixed or determinable

.  We
    assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on
    the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to
    refund or adjustment.

•

Collectability is reasonably assured

.  We
    assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the
    customer as determined by our credit checks and the
    customer’s payment history. We record accounts receivable
    net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer
    returns, and pricing credits.



For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of
    products that include services, we allocate revenue to each
    element using the residual method based on the vendor-specific
    objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value of the
    undelivered items. Under the residual method, the amount of
    revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total
    arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any
    undelivered elements. VSOE of fair value is based on the price
    charged when the element is sold separately. We then recognize
    revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for
    product and service revenue recognition. If VSOE of fair value
    of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue is
    deferred and recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of
    those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established
    unless maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which
    case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
    contractual support period. Our ability to recognize revenue in
    the future may be affected if actual selling prices are
    significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to
    recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions
    imposed by our customers.

For sales to direct end-users and value-added resellers, we
    recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of
    loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to
    identify an end-user prior to shipment to a value-added
    reseller. For our end-users and value-added resellers, there are
    no significant obligations for future performance such as rights
    of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made
    through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing
    credits or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on
    sales made through these distributors upon sell-through as
    reported to us by the distributors. Deferred revenue on
    shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor
    pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be
    realized upon sell-through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of
    the related product costs of revenue.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns
    and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection,
    in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The
    amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns
    and price protection credits, specific criteria included in
    rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Should
    actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our
    estimates, additional reductions to revenue may be required. In
    addition, we report revenue net of sales taxes.

Services include maintenance, training, and professional
    services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts.
    Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is
    recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is
    generally one to three years. Revenue from training and
    professional services is recognized as the services are
    completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is
    generally one year or less.

We sell certain interests in accounts receivable on a
    non-recourse basis as part of a distributor accounts receivable
    financing arrangement primarily with one major financing
    company. We record cash received under this arrangement in
    advance of revenue recognition as short-term debt with a balance
    of $33.0 million and $10.0 million as of
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Contract Manufacturer Liabilities.

We
    outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain
    management operations to our independent contract manufacturers
    and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of
    payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure
    components and manufacture our products based on our demand
    forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future
    demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical
    trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing
    organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We
    establish a provision for inventory, carrying costs and obsolete
    material exposures for excess components purchased based on
    historical trends. If the actual component usage and product
    demand are significantly lower than forecasted, which may be
    caused by factors outside of our control, it could have an
    adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Supply
    chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk
    of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order
    to reduce lead times.

•

Warranty Costs.

We generally offer a one-year
    warranty on all of our hardware products and a

90-day

warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the
    products. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of
    sales based on associated material costs, labor costs for
    customer support, and overhead at the time revenue is
    recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily based upon the
    historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the
    warranty period. Technical support labor and overhead cost are
    estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to
    support the customer cases within the warranty period. Although
    we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
    use



of materials, technical labor costs and associated overhead
    incurred. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials,
    or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, we may
    incur additional warranty costs, which could reduce gross margin.

•

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.

Our
    methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to
    acquisitions is determined through established valuation
    techniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess purchase price of
    an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible
    and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities
    assumed. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified
    intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future
    amortization. The value of our intangible assets, including
    goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as:
    (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a
    sustained decline in our market capitalization,
    (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the
    networking industry, or (iv) failure to meet our forecasted
    operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis
    as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of
    impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential
    impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant
    judgment at many points during the analysis. In the process of
    our annual impairment review, we determine the fair value of our
    intangible assets based upon a weighting of the market approach
    and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate
    fair value of our reporting units by comparing them to
    transactions involving publicly-traded companies in similar
    lines of business. Under the income approach, we calculate fair
    value of a reporting unit based on the present value of
    estimated future cash flows. The weighted fair value of each
    reporting unit is compared to the allocated book value of each
    reporting unit. If the book value exceeds the fair value, we
    revalue the assets associated with the impaired reporting unit.
    The impairment is the difference between the new fair values and
    the existing book values of the impaired asset. The estimates we
    have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we
    use to manage our business. If our actual results or the plans
    and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than
    the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of
    these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.

•

Stock-Based Compensation.

We recognize
    stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment
    awards including employee stock options, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”), performance share awards, and purchases
    under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan granted after
    December 31, 2005, and granted prior to but not yet vested
    as of December 31, 2005, in accordance with SFAS 123R.
    We valued compensation expense for expected-to-vest stock-based
    awards that were granted on or prior to December 31, 2005,
    under the multiple-option approach. We amortize these
    share-based payments using the accelerated attribution method.
    Subsequent to December 31, 2005, compensation expense for
    expected-to-vest stock-based awards is valued under the
    single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis,
    net of estimated forfeitures. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R, we accounted for stock-based compensation under
    the intrinsic value recognition provisions of APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”).

We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”)
    option-pricing model and incorporate a Monte Carlo simulation
    when appropriate in order to determine the fair value of
    stock-based awards under SFAS 123R. The BSM model requires
    various highly subjective assumptions including volatility,
    expected option life, and risk-free interest rate. The expected
    volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded
    options on our common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors
    including historical volatility of our common stock over the
    most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life
    of our stock options. The expected life of an award is based on
    historical experience, the terms and conditions of the stock
    awards granted to employees, as well as the potential effect
    from options that have not been exercised at the time.

The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of
    share-based payment awards represent management’s best
    estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and
    the application of management’s judgment. If factors change
    and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation
    expense could be materially different in the future. In
    addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture
    rate and recognize expense only for those expected-to-vest
    shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different
    from our estimate, our recorded stock-based compensation expense
    could be different.

•

Income Taxes.

Estimates and judgments occur in
    the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the
    determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax
    assets, which arise from temporary differences and
    carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
    using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to



taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
    are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the
    likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from
    recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income
    based on the realization criteria set forth in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

(“SFAS 109”). To the extent that we
    believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized,
    we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax
    assets. We believe it is more likely than not that future income
    from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and forecasted
    income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining
    deferred tax assets. In the event we determine that all or part
    of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future,
    an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to
    earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if
    we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously
    determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation
    allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment
    to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such
    determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax
    liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
    application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential
    liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
    which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts
    ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the
    liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the
    period when we determine the liabilities are no longer
    necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the
    amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would
    result.

Significant judgment is also required in determining any
    valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In
    assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all
    available evidence, including past operating results, estimates
    of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning
    strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to
    the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will
    adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to
    the provision for income taxes in the period in which such
    determination is made.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN
    48”), which was a change in accounting for income taxes.
    FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and
    measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance
    with SFAS 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax
    position for recognition by determining if the weight of
    available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not
    that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest
    amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon
    settlement. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on
    de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. The
    application of FIN 48 may increase an entity’s future
    effective tax rates and its future intra-period effective tax
    rate volatility. As of January 1, 2007, our cumulative
    effect of applying FIN 48 was a $19.2 million increase
    to the opening balance of accumulated deficit and a
    $1.0 million increase to goodwill.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax
    positions under FIN 48 and determining our provision for
    income taxes. Although we believe our reserves under FIN 48
    are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax
    outcome of these matters will not be different from that which
    is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and
    accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts
    and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the
    refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax
    outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded,
    such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in
    the period in which such determination is made. The provision
    for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under
    FIN 48 and any changes to the reserves that are considered
    appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties,
    if applicable.

•

Loss Contingencies.

We are subject to the
    possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the
    ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss
    or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as
    well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss,
    in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency
    is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired
    or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. We record a charge equal to at least the
    minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss
    contingency only when both of the following conditions are met:
    (i) information available prior to issuance of our
    consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable
    that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred
    at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range
    of loss can



be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current
    information available to us to determine whether such accruals
    should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and
    other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current
    litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties
    associated with any litigation, and these actions or other
    third-party claims against us may cause us to incur costly
    litigation

and/or

substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of
    any future intellectual property litigation may require us to
    make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross
    margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur,
    our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
    cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in
    any such matters may be materially different from our estimates,
    which could result in the need to adjust our liability and
    record additional expenses.

Our net product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily due to increased sales of products from both our
    Infrastructure and SLT solutions to the service provider and
    enterprise markets. In particular, we had success in selling our
    Infrastructure products to service providers who are adopting
    NGN IP networks, which are designed for higher capacity and
    efficiency to help reduce total operating costs and to be able
    to offer multiple services over a single network. In 2008, our
    new product releases and further expansion into emerging markets
    contributed to the increase in total net product revenues. Our
    net service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue from our
    expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts.

Our net revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily
    due to growth in both product and service revenues. Our revenue
    performance and share gains were driven by Infrastructure and
    SLT product revenues. Service revenues also increased in 2007
    compared to 2006 primarily due to the increase in our installed
    base of equipment under service contracts and, to a lesser
    extent, growth in professional service revenues.



Changes
    to Segments

Beginning in January 2008, we realigned our reporting structure
    which resulted in two segments: Infrastructure and SLT. The
    previously reported Service segment has been combined into the
    following two segments:

•

Infrastructure:

Our Infrastructure segment
    consists primarily of products and services related to the E-,
    M-, MX-, and T-series router product families, EX-series
    switching products, as well as the circuit-to-circuit products.

•

SLT:

Our SLT segment consists primarily of
    products and services related to our firewall/VPN
    (“Firewall”) systems and appliances, SSL VPN
    appliances, IDP appliances, the J-series router product family,
    and WAN optimization platforms.

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the 2008
    segment structure, which now includes service revenues in the
    Infrastructure and SLT segments.

Infrastructure —
    Product

Infrastructure product revenues increased in 2008 compared to
    2007, primarily attributable to revenue growth from our M-MX-
    and T-series product families, from sales to both the service
    provider and enterprise markets due to our customers’
    increased demand for network infrastructure solutions. To a
    lesser extent, our EX-series products, which were introduced in
    the first quarter of 2008, and our

E-series

products also contributed to the revenue growth in 2008. In
    2008, we experienced sales growth in both the service provider
    and enterprise markets. From a geographical perspective, in
    2008, we experienced revenue growth in all three regions, with
    particular strength in the Americas region.

Infrastructure product revenues increased in 2007 compared to
    2006, primarily attributable to increased revenues from our M-,
    T-, and MX-series router products, driven by our service
    provider customers’ continued build-out of NGNs as their
    bandwidth requirement increased. Our service provider customers
    also moved towards NGNs that are designed to enable a fast and
    cost-effective deployment of differentiating multi-play services
    that allow them to generate new sources of revenues. Also
    contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in
    Infrastructure product sales to the content service provider and
    the enterprise markets. From a geographical perspective, we
    experienced revenue growth in all three regions with particular
    strength in the Americas region.

We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped
    to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential
    network growth. Most of our Infrastructure product platforms are
    modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform.
    Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to
    be populated with components we refer to as modules or
    interfaces. The modules are the components through which the
    platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of
    transmission media. The physical connection between a
    transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The
    number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the
    functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis
    revenue units represent the number of



chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. The
    following table shows Infrastructure revenue units and ports
    shipped:

Excludes fixed configuration Ethernet switching products.

Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2008 compared
    to 2007, primarily due to the product mix that favored higher
    capacity chassis revenue units, which was driven by bandwidth
    demand as our customers sought to expand capabilities in their
    networks and to offer differentiating, feature-rich, multi-play
    services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues.
    The port shipments also increased in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily due to the increase in the overall number of chassis
    revenue units from richly configured T- and M-series router
    chassis revenue units shipped during the 2008 period.

Chassis revenue units increased in 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily due to the introduction of the MX-series products,
    which are our Carrier Ethernet services routers. We also
    experienced growth in our M- and T-series products, driven by
    bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand
    voice and video capability in their existing networks. The port
    shipment units increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due
    to the growth in chassis revenue units with larger expansion
    capacity and our customers’ need to differentiate
    themselves by providing feature-rich, multi-play services.

Infrastructure —
    Service

Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2008 compared to
    2007, primarily due to an increase in our installed base of
    equipment being serviced. Installed base is calculated based on
    the number of systems that our customers have under maintenance.
    A majority of our service revenues is earned from customers that
    purchase our products and simultaneously enter into service
    contracts for support service. We also experienced increased
    professional service revenues due to consulting projects.

Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2007 compared to
    2006, primarily driven by increased technical support service
    contracts associated with higher Infrastructure product sales,
    which have resulted in increased renewals and a larger installed
    base of equipment being serviced. To a lesser extent,
    professional services also contributed to the growth in net
    service revenues in 2007. Professional service revenues
    increased primarily due to large customer deployments requiring
    consulting services.

SLT —
    Product

SLT product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to an increase in revenues from Firewall and
    J-series products. These increases were partially offset by a
    decline in revenues from DX and WX products. The integrated
    systems introduced prior to 2007, such as the SSG Firewall
    products, gained further traction in the market place with
    revenues from these product lines growing in 2008 compared to
    2007. In 2008, we experienced sales growth both in the service
    provider and enterprise markets. Geographically, revenues
    increased in the EMEA and APAC regions and decreased in the
    Americas region.

SLT product revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily attributable to the increased revenues across the
    majority of the SLT product families, in particular, the
    Firewall, SSL, WAN Optimization and J-series products. The
    integrated systems introduced prior to 2007, such as the ISG and
    SSG firewall products, gained traction in the market place and
    generated additional revenues in 2007. All three geographic
    regions had significant growth in SLT revenues during 2007. We
    experienced a growing demand for our SLT products in both the
    enterprise and service provider markets as we focused on
    cross-selling more integrated products and solutions in the
    enterprise and service provider markets while leveraging
    partnerships with open standards-based interoperability of our
    SLT products.

SLT revenue units increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007.
    The percentage increase in SLT revenue units was lower than the
    percentage increase in product revenues, primarily due to the
    product mix that favored products with higher average selling
    prices.

In January 2008, we announced a plan to phase out our DX product
    line. These products will be supported until 2013. We do not
    expect this plan to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

SLT revenue units increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily
    attributable to the growing demand for our SLT products in the
    market place. The percentage increase in SLT revenue units was
    greater than the percentage increase in product revenues,
    primarily due to the increased revenues from sales of our branch
    Firewall products, which have lower average selling price than
    other SLT products.

SLT —
    Service

SLT service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment
    being serviced. A majority of our service revenues is earned
    from customers that purchase our products and simultaneously
    enter into support service contracts.

SLT service revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily driven by an increase in support service contracts
    associated with the increase in SLT product sales. To a lesser
    extent, professional services also contributed to the growth in
    net service revenues in 2007.

Net revenues in the Americas region increased in absolute
    dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2008
    compared to 2007, primarily due to growth in Infrastructure
    revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets,
    as our customers continued to focus on increasing network
    performance, reliability, and scale. In the United States, net
    revenues increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of
    total net revenues, in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to
    growth in revenues from both the service provider and enterprise
    markets. Net revenues in the Americas region increased in
    absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in 2007
    compared to 2006, primarily due to strength in the United States
    and in Latin America. In the United States, net revenues
    increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total
    revenues in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to revenue
    growth in Infrastructure product and services from our service
    provider and Internet content provider customers.

Net revenues in EMEA increased in absolute dollars in 2008
    compared to 2007, primarily due to revenue growth in emerging
    markets in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which was driven
    by service provider network build-outs as a result of bandwidth
    demand as well as growth in demand in the enterprise market. Net
    revenues in EMEA as a percentage of total net revenues decreased
    in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the relative strength
    of the Americas region. Net revenues in EMEA increased in
    absolute dollars in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to
    increased Infrastructure product and SLT product revenues along
    with increased service revenues driven by strong bandwidth
    demands in Europe, as well as revenue growth from sales in
    emerging markets in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Net
    revenues in EMEA as a percentage of total net revenues decreased
    in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the relative strength
    of the Americas region.

Net revenues in APAC increased in absolute dollars in 2008
    compared to 2007, primarily due to strength in Japan, China, and
    the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”)
    countries, which was mainly driven by bandwidth demand as well
    as our customers’ deployment of routing platforms for their
    NGNs, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from Australia.
    Net revenues in APAC increased in absolute dollars and as a
    percentage of total net revenues in 2007 compared 2006,
    primarily due to increased revenues from Infrastructure
    products, SLT products and service driven by demands from
    service providers as well as enterprise customers resulting from
    cross-selling of our product portfolio. We experienced revenue
    growth across the region with strength in Korea, Australia,
    Malaysia, India, and Indonesia.

Net
    Revenues by Markets and Customers

We sell our high-performance network products and service
    offerings from both the Infrastructure and SLT segments to two
    primary markets — service providers and enterprise
    customers. The service provider market includes wireline,
    wireless, and cable operators as well as major Internet content
    and application providers. The enterprise market represents
    businesses; federal, state and local governments, and research
    and education institutions. In 2008, the service provider market
    accounted for 71.9% of our total net revenues, and the
    enterprise market accounted for 28.1% of our total net revenues.
    In 2007, the service provider market accounted for 71.0% of



our total net revenues, and the enterprise market accounted for
    29.0% of our total net revenues. Net revenues to the service
    provider market increased by 27% in 2008 compared to 2007. Net
    revenues to the enterprise market increased by 22% in 2008
    compared to 2007. In 2006, the service provider market accounted
    for 70.8% of our total net revenues, and the enterprise market
    accounted for 29.2% of our total net revenues. Net revenues to
    the service provider market increased by 24% in 2007 compared to
    2006. Net revenues to the enterprise market increased by 22% in
    2007 compared to 2006.

No single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our net
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. NSN and its
    predecessor companies accounted for greater than 10.0% of our
    net revenues in 2007 and 2006.

The cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars in
    2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to our increase in product
    revenues, which resulted in higher product costs. The slight
    decrease in product gross margin as a percentage of product
    revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, is primarily attributable to
    changes in the product mix, partially offset by growth in our
    higher-margin T- and M-series product families within our
    Infrastructure segment and increased sales of our higher-margin
    Firewall and J-series products within our SLT segment. As of
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, we had 230 and
    190 employees, respectively, in our manufacturing and
    operations organization that primarily manage relationships with
    our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor
    and manage product testing and quality.

The cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars in
    2007 compared to 2006, primarily attributable to increased
    product revenues in both the enterprise and service provider
    markets. The product gross margin slightly increased in 2007
    compared to 2006, primarily due to favorable product mix and, to
    a lesser extent, improvements in standard costs of our
    Infrastructure products, partially offset by a slight decrease
    in our SLT product gross margin. As of December 31, 2007,
    and 2006, we had 190 and 149 employees, respectively, in
    our manufacturing and operations organization.

The cost of service revenues and service gross margin increased
    in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was commensurate with the
    growth in revenues in absolute dollars attributable to the
    growth in our installed equipment base. Service-related
    headcount increased by 35 employees, or 5%, to
    783 employees in 2008, compared to 748 in 2007.
    Personnel-related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe
    benefits expenses, and stock-based compensation expenses,
    represented the majority of the increases in cost of service
    revenues in 2008. Total personnel-related charges as a
    percentage of service revenues were approximately 20% for 2008
    and 23% for 2007. The decrease in personnel-related charges in
    2008 as a percentage of service revenues, is primarily due to
    the overall increase in service revenues. Our outside service
    expense also increased in 2008, primarily to support the
    expanding installed equipment base. Freight-related expense
    increased primarily to support larger volume of spare parts in
    supporting our growth. Additionally, facilities and information
    technology expenses related to cost of service revenues
    increased in connection with the growth of service business as a
    portion of our overall operations.

Cost of service revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006,
    while service gross margin decreased slightly in 2007 as
    compared to 2006. The increase in service costs and the decrease
    in gross margin were primarily



attributable to increases in headcount-related expenses
    associated with expanding our service delivery infrastructure
    and professional service organization, particularly in North
    America and in India, as well as increasing our resources for
    supporting network build-outs and deployments by our customers.
    Service-related headcount increased by 137 employees, or
    22%, to 748 employees in 2007, compared to 611 in 2006.
    Personnel-related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe
    benefits expenses, and stock-based compensation expenses,
    represented the majority of the increases in cost of service
    revenues in 2007. Total personnel-related charges as a
    percentage of service revenues were approximately 23% and 21%
    for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Outside service expense
    increased as we used outside providers to support the increase
    in customer support contracts and professional engagements.
    Freight-related expense increased due to the deployment of spare
    parts in supporting our growth overseas. Facilities and
    information technology expenses related to the cost of service
    revenues increased in 2007, which is consistent with other areas
    of our organization, due to our headcount growth and investment
    in internal infrastructure to support our growing business.
    Partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in spares
    component purchases due to a large purchase we made in 2006.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include costs of developing
    our products from components to prototypes to finished products,
    costs for outside services such as certifications of new
    products, and expenditures associated with equipment used for
    testing. Several components of our research and development
    effort require significant expenditures, such as the development
    of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the
    timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses.
    We expense our research and development costs as they are
    incurred.



Research and development expenses increased in 2008 compared to
    2007, primarily due to strategic initiatives to expand our
    product portfolio and maintain our technological advantage over
    our competitors. In particular, in 2008 we continued to expand
    our EX-series Ethernet switching products, and invested in
    our recently announced SRX dynamic services gateways and
    intelligent services edge offering that advances the M- and
    MX-series platforms. Research and development expenses primarily
    consist of personnel-related expenses and new product
    development costs. Personnel-related charges, consisting of
    salaries, bonus, fringe benefits expenses, and stock-based
    compensation expenses, increased $59.3 million, or 16%, to
    $435.2 million in 2008 primarily due to a 25% increase in
    headcount in our engineering organization, from 2,563 to
    3,194 employees, to support product innovation intended to
    capture anticipated future network infrastructure growth and
    opportunities. Outside consulting and other development expense
    also increased to support our product innovation initiatives.
    Additionally, facilities and information technology expenses
    related to research and development expenses increased to
    support these engineering efforts.

Research and development expense increased in 2007 compared to
    2006, primarily due to our commitment to continue innovation of
    our products. In particular, in 2007 we continued the
    development of our Ethernet products, including the MX-series
    and our EX-series Ethernet switching products introduced in
    January 2008, as well as the development of our T1600 product,
    which was released in November 2007. Personnel-related charges,
    consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits expenses, and
    stock-based compensation expenses, which comprise the majority
    of our research and development expenses, increased primarily
    due to headcount growth and merit-based salary increases in
    2007. Research and development related headcount increased by
    493 employees, or 24%, in 2007 to 2,563 employees as
    of December 31, 2007. Headcount increase was primarily due
    to additional hires in the engineering organization within the
    Infrastructure segment. In addition to personnel-related
    expenses, we also increased prototype and lab equipment expenses
    in 2007 for the development of our new products. Additionally,
    facilities and information technology expenses, as well as
    depreciation expenses, for our research and development
    organization increased in 2007 due to increases in headcount
    from additional internal systems to support our growth. In
    general, we grew our engineering organizations to support
    product innovation, expand and improve our product portfolio,
    and address growth opportunities in NGN bandwidth and features
    for our service provider and enterprise customers.

Sales and
    Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses include costs for selling and
    promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment,
    and advertisements. These costs vary quarter-to-quarter
    depending on revenues, product launches, and marketing
    initiatives. We have an extensive distribution channel in place
    that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have
    made substantial investments in our distribution channel during
    2008, 2007, and 2006.

Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses and
    marketing expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and
    marketing expenses decreased in 2008 due to our focus on
    managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales
    activities. Personnel-related charges, consisting of salaries,
    commissions, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock-based
    compensation expenses, increased $70.8 million, or 17%, to
    $497.2 million in 2008, primarily due to an 18% increase in
    headcount in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations,
    from 1,863 to 2,190 employees. Included in
    personnel-related charges was an increase in commission expense
    of $5.3 million in 2008 compared to 2007, due to our higher
    net revenues. We also increased our investment in corporate and
    channel marketing efforts from the prior year. As our sales
    force grew, we also increased facilities and information
    technology expenses related to the sales and marketing
    organizations in 2008 compared to 2007.

Sales and marketing expenses increased 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily due to increases in personnel-related charges. As a
    percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses
    decreased slightly in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our
    operating margin and the efficiency of our sales activities. The
    increases in absolute dollars were primarily headcount-related
    increases. Sales and marketing related headcount increased
    272 employees, or 17%, in 2007 to 1,863 as of
    December 31, 2007, as we hired additional personnel across
    our Infrastructure and SLT organizations to support the larger
    product portfolio and to expand our presence in the enterprise
    marketplace. In addition, commission expenses increased
    primarily as a result of strong revenue growth. In 2007, we also
    increased



consulting expenses to support our sales and marketing
    initiatives. Likewise, our demand for demonstration equipment
    has grown as we seek to capture new markets and release new
    products. As the sales and marketing organization expands, we
    have also grown our facilities and information technology
    expenses related to the sales and marketing organization.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses include professional fees,
    bad debt provisions, and other corporate expenses. Professional
    fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting, and certain
    corporate strategic services.

General and administrative expenses increased in 2008 compared
    to 2007, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related
    expenses and outside professional services. As a percentage of
    net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased
    slightly in 2008 due to our focus on managing expenses and
    growing revenues. Personnel-related charges, consisting of
    salaries, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock-based compensation
    expenses, increased $12.4 million, or 21%, to
    $71.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a
    20% increase in headcount in our worldwide general and
    administrative functions, from 291 to 350 employees, to
    support the overall growth of the business. Outside professional
    service fees increased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of
    increased legal fees and business process re-engineering costs.
    Additionally, facilities and information technology expenses
    related to our general and administrative infrastructure
    increased to support our growing business.

General and administrative expenses increased in 2007 compared
    to 2006. As a percentage of net revenues, general and
    administrative expenses slightly decreased in 2007 due to our
    focus on increasing our operating margin. The increases in
    absolute dollars were primarily due to a 24% increase in
    headcount in our worldwide general and administrative functions,
    from 235 to 291 employees, to support the overall growth of
    the business. The headcount increases were primarily in the
    finance and human resources organizations as we expanded our
    organization infrastructure in lower cost regions, improved
    internal processes, and continued our initiatives to update our
    information systems. Outside services increased
    $4.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as we invested in
    designing a more efficient organizational structure and
    improving our internal systems. Such increases were offset by
    decreases in accounting and legal fees of $1.5 million for
    2007, compared to 2006. Consistent with other areas of our
    organization, facilities and information technology expenses
    related to our general and administrative infrastructure
    increased in order to support these initiatives and the growth
    of our business.

Amortization
    of Purchased Intangible Assets

Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2008
    compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in amortization
    expense as certain purchased intangible assets became fully
    amortized during the second quarter of 2008. Amortization of
    purchased intangible assets decreased in 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily due to certain purchased intangible assets reaching
    the end of their amortization period during 2007.

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

We had no impairment against our goodwill in 2008 and 2007. In
    2008, we recognized an impairment charge of $5.0 million
    against our purchased intangible assets, as a result of the
    phase-out of our DX products. We had no impairment on our
    purchased intangible assets in 2007. In 2006, we incurred
    impairment charges of $1,283.4 million as a result of the
    impairment of both goodwill and purchased intangible assets. The
    impairment charges were primarily due to the decline in our
    market capitalization that occurred over a period of
    approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to
    a lesser extent, to a decrease in the forecasted future cash
    flows used in the income approach. Based upon our impairment
    review, we reduced the carrying value of goodwill within the SLT
    segment by $1,280.0 million. In 2006, we recorded a
    $3.4 million impairment charge pertaining to a write-down
    of purchased intangible assets as a result of a decrease in our
    revenue forecast for our Session Border Control
    (“SBC”) products. See Note 5 — Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets in Item 8 of Part II
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for more information on our impairment of goodwill and purchased
    intangible assets.



Other
    Charges, Net

Other charges are summarized as follows:

•

Restructuring and Acquisition-Related
    Charges.

There were no restructuring and
    acquisition-related charges in 2008. In 2007, we recorded net
    restructuring and acquisition-related charges of
    $0.7 million, of which $1.1 million pertained to bonus
    accruals associated with past acquisitions, partially offset by
    a benefit of $0.4 million pertaining to net restructuring
    adjustments. We recorded net restructuring and
    acquisition-related charges of $5.9 million in 2006, of
    which $5.6 million was due to accrued bonuses associated
    with past acquisitions, and $0.3 million was due to net
    restructuring-related charges, including $0.7 million in
    restructuring charges associated with a program to reduce
    product development costs and the discontinuation of our SBC
    product.

•

Stock Option Investigation Costs.

There were
    no such stock option investigation costs recorded in 2008. We
    recorded expenses of $6.0 million and $20.5 million in
    2007 and 2006, respectively, related to professional fees and
    other costs in connection with our investigation into historical
    stock option granting practices.

•

Stock Option Amendment and Tax-Related
    Charges.

There were no stock option amendment and
    tax-related charges recorded in 2008. We recorded
    $8.0 million and $10.1 million in operating expense
    during 2007 and 2006, respectively, in relation to the amendment
    of stock options and to the payment of certain taxes and
    penalties associated with employee stock option exercises.

•

Net Settlement (Loss) Gain.

We recorded a net
    legal settlement loss of $9.0 million in 2008, related to
    our shareholder derivative lawsuit. In 2007, we recognized a net
    legal settlement gain of $5.3 million, which consisted of
    cash settlement proceeds of $6.2 million, net of the
    $0.9 million legal expense related to direct transaction
    costs incurred in the third quarter of 2007. There were no legal
    settlement gains or losses recorded in 2006.

Interest
    and Other Income, Net

Net interest and other income decreased in 2008 compared to
    2007, primarily due to lower interest rates during 2008.

Net interest and other income decreased in 2007 compared to
    2006, resulting from a decrease in interest income due to a
    lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balance, which was
    attributable to common stock repurchases of approximately
    $1.6 billion during the first and second quarters of 2007.
    Partially offsetting the decreases was the higher interest yield
    combined with higher positive cash flows from operations
    compared to 2006. Interest and other expenses slightly increased
    in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to costs associated with
    our distributor financing program. See Note 8 —
    Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for a full description of our distributor financing program.
    Other interest



and expenses include short-term debt expenses, debt issuance
    cost amortization, foreign exchange losses, and other
    miscellaneous expenses such as bank fees.

(Loss)
    Gain on Equity Investments

During 2008, we recognized impairment losses of
    $14.8 million on our investments in privately-held and
    publicly-traded companies for changes in fair value that we
    believed were other than temporary. In June 2007, one of the
    companies in which we had a minority equity investment completed
    an initial public offering (“IPO”). As a result, we
    realized a gain of $6.7 million during 2007 based upon the
    difference between the market value of our investment at the
    time of the IPO and our cost basis. During 2006, none of our
    investments had any recognized gain or loss.

Income
    Tax Provision

Our effective tax rates were 29.8%, 29.3%, and (11.6%) in 2008,
    2007, and 2006, respectively. The increase in the overall rate
    in 2008 compared to 2007, was primarily due to the differences
    in the geographic mix of our taxable income and the level of
    research and development credits in the U.S. The 2006
    effective tax rate differs from 2008 and 2007, primarily due to
    the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the
    goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006.

We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2004 tax
    year, the Indian tax authorities for the 2004 tax year, and the
    German tax authorities for the 2005 tax year. Additionally, we
    have not reached a final resolution with the IRS on an
    adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years. We are
    not under examination by any other major jurisdictions in which
    we file income tax returns as of December 31, 2008.

In September 2008, as part of the on-going 2004 IRS audit, we
    received a proposed adjustment related to our business credit
    carry-forwards, which if agreed, would reduce our business
    credit carry-forwards. In December 2008, we received a
    proposed adjustment from the Indian tax authorities related to
    the 2004 tax year. We are pursuing all available administrative
    procedures relative to these matters. In December 2008, we
    reached a tentative settlement with the German tax authorities
    for the 2005 tax year. We believe that we have adequately
    provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to
    these proposed adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these
    matters is unlikely to have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

We do not expect complete resolution of any IRS, or other audits
    within significant foreign or state jurisdictions within the
    next 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that we
    may reach agreement with certain issues and as a result, the
    amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
    decrease by approximately $13.0 million within the next
    12 months.

For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the
    U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation
    of our income tax provision, see Note 12 — Income
    Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on

Infrastructure
    Segment

An analysis of the change in revenues for the Infrastructure
    segment, and the change in revenue units, can be found above in
    the section titled “Net Revenues.”

Infrastructure segment operating income increased in 2008
    compared to 2007, primarily due to revenue growth from our
    router product families and, to a lesser extent, our new
    Ethernet switching product family, which outpaced



expense growth. Infrastructure product gross margin increased in
    absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to
    revenues from richly configured high-end T- and M-series router
    products as well as high-margin port shipments. The
    Infrastructure gross margin percentage decreased slightly in
    2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to product mix,
    particularly from an increase in the mix of lower-margin

E-series

products in 2008.

We continued to invest in research and development efforts to
    continue our innovation of products and expand our
    Infrastructure product portfolio, but our research and
    development expense decreased as a percentage of Infrastructure
    net revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to cost
    control initiatives that resulted in revenue growing faster than
    expenses. We will continue to make investments to expand our
    product features and functionality based upon the trends in the
    marketplace. Additionally, our sales and marketing expenses
    decreased slightly as a percentage of Infrastructure net
    revenues, but increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to
    2007, as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and
    service provider customers. We allocate sales and marketing,
    general and administrative, as well as facility and information
    technology expenses to the Infrastructure segment generally
    based upon revenue, usage, and headcount.

Infrastructure segment operating income increased in 2007
    compared to 2006, primarily due to revenue growth from our
    router product families, which outpaced expense growth. Our
    increase in revenue was partially offset by our continued
    investments in research and development efforts as we sought to
    continue our innovation of products and expand our
    Infrastructure product portfolio. In 2007, our sales and
    marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net
    revenues, but increased in absolute dollars as we increased our
    efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers.

SLT
    Segment

An analysis of the change in revenues for the SLT segment, and
    the change in units, can be found above in the section titled
    “Net Revenues.”

SLT segment operating income increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to revenue growth in our Firewall and J-series
    products and the growth in our installed equipment base for
    service contracts, which outpaced the increase in SLT expenses.
    SLT product gross margin and gross margin percentage increased
    in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to product mix,
    particularly from an increase in the mix of higher-margin
    Firewall and

J-series

products in 2008. Research and development related costs
    increased in absolute dollars, but decreased as a percentage of
    SLT revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the
    addition of headcount in regions with lower operating costs and
    revenue growing faster than research and development expenses.
    Additionally, sales and marketing as well as general and
    administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of SLT net
    revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to our focused
    execution. We allocate sales and marketing, general and
    administrative, as well as facility and information technology
    expenses to the SLT segment generally based on revenue, usage,
    and headcount. In the past, we have generally experienced
    quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our SLT
    products, particularly in the fourth quarter, which may result
    in greater variations in our quarterly operating results.

SLT segment operating income increased slightly in 2007 compared
    to 2006, primarily due to revenue growth, which outpaced the
    increase in SLT expenses. SLT product gross margin and gross
    margin percentage increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily
    due to product mix, particularly from an increase that favored
    higher-margin products. The increase in SLT operating expenses
    was due primarily to the increase in information technology
    expenses allocated to the SLT segment and the higher variable
    compensation expenses associated with company-wide revenue
    growth. Additionally, we strategically invested in our research
    and development efforts to develop technologies and products for
    the JUNOS platform. In an effort to control costs, we moved a
    significant portion of the SLT development organization to lower
    cost regions while expanding our product portfolio. SLT segment
    operating income was affected by continued investments in our
    sales and distribution channels. SLT gross margin decreased
    slightly in 2007 compared to 2006, due to higher manufacturing
    costs associated with new and more complex products. Higher
    manufacturing costs were partially offset by our cost-reduction
    efforts to move more manufacturing to lower cost regions. The
    increases in SLT operating expenses were partially offset by our
    revenue growth especially in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to
    increased customer demand for security products, particularly
    Firewall, and due to typical quarterly seasonality.



Stock-Based
    Compensation and Related Payroll Taxes

Stock-based compensation expense increased in 2008 compared to
    2007. The increase was primarily attributable to new stock
    options and RSU grants during 2008 and the timing of the
    recognition of stock-based compensation expense for RSUs granted
    in the last month of the fourth quarter of 2007. Stock-based
    compensation related payroll tax expense, which represents
    employment taxes we incurred in connection with our employee
    stock programs decreased in 2008 compared to 2007. Changes in
    such expenses are primarily attributable to the timing and
    volume of stock options exercises by our employees. We
    experienced a considerable decrease in these expenses due to the
    decrease in our share price during 2008.

Stock-based compensation expense increased in 2007 compared to
    2006. The increase was primarily attributable to new stock
    options and RSU grants, partially offset by the lower stock
    option expense in 2007 resulting from the acceleration of
    vesting of certain unvested and

“out-of-the-money”

stock options completed in December 2005 (“2005 stock
    option vesting acceleration”). Stock-based compensation
    related payroll tax expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006.
    We experienced a considerable increase in these expenses due to
    the increase in our share price during 2007. In contrast,
    employee stock option exercises were restricted during the
    majority of 2006 due to our stock option investigation.

Key
    Performance Measures

In addition to the financial metrics included in the
    consolidated financial statements, we use the following key
    performance measures to assess operating results:

Years Ended

(1)

DSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable,
    net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the
    preceding 90 days.

Book-to-bill

ratio represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by
    product revenues during the respective period.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our
    consolidated balance sheet and cash flows, contractual
    obligations, other commitments, and our stock repurchase program
    on our liquidity and capital resources.

Overview

Historically, we have funded our business primarily through our
    operating activities and the issuance of our common stock. The
    following table shows our capital resources (in millions, except
    percentages):

The significant components of our working capital are cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts
    receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities,
    and deferred revenue. The increase in



working capital from December 31, 2007, to
    December 31, 2008, is primarily due to the increase in cash
    and cash equivalents, and the non-cash settlement of the current
    portion of long-term debt due to the maturity of our senior
    convertible notes in June 2008. See Note 8 — Debt
    in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for discussion of our senior convertible notes. The increase in
    cash and cash equivalents during 2008 is primarily due to cash
    generated by our operating activities of $875.2 million
    along with the issuance of common stock for $119.5 million
    through stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase
    plan purchases, partially offset by repurchases of our common
    stock of $604.7 million.

Summary
    of Cash Flows

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $875.2 million, $786.5 million, and
    $755.6 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The
    cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to
    our net income (loss) adjusted by:

•

Non-cash charges of $255.8 million, $257.5 million,
    and $1,536.4 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively. These non-cash charges primarily related to
    depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based
    compensation, excess tax benefits from employee stock-based
    compensation, and gain/loss on equity investments. In 2006,
    non-cash charges also included charges of $1,283.4 million
    related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.

•

Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of
    $107.6 million, $168.2 million, and
    $220.6 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, were
    generated in the normal course of business. These changes were
    primarily due to increases in accounts payable, accrued
    compensation, taxes payable, and deferred revenue, partially
    offset by accounts receivable. The increase in accounts payable
    was due to the timing of payments to contract manufacturers and
    the growth of our business. The increase in accrued compensation
    was due to increases in headcount. Additionally, the increase in
    accrued compensation in 2007 compared to 2006, was due to the
    removal of a suspension on employee purchases of shares under
    the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The increase in taxes payable
    was due to the increase in the tax provision, movement of
    deferred tax assets, and the timing of payments. The increase in
    deferred revenue was due to the growing installed base and
    customer payments in advance of product acceptance. In addition,
    these increases in cash flows from operations were partially
    offset by a negative cash flow due to an increase in net
    accounts receivable, which was primarily due to the growth in
    our business and net revenues.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $149.8 million
    for 2008 as compared to net cash generated by investing
    activities of $571.8 million in 2007. In 2006, cash
    generated by investing activities was $11.9 million. The
    changes between periods was primarily due to the movement of
    cash from short- and long-term investments to cash and cash
    equivalents during 2007 in anticipation of stock repurchases
    under the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $422.4 million,
    $1,238.5 million and $89.6 million for 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively. In 2008, we used $604.7 million to
    repurchase our common stock, partially offset by cash proceeds
    of $119.5 million from common stock issued to employees,

    repurchases in 2007, partially offset by cash proceeds of
    $355.0 million from common stock issued to employees. In

    stock, partially offset by cash proceeds of $87.1 million
    from common stock issued to employees.

Guarantees

We have entered into agreements with some of our customers that
    contain indemnification provisions relating to potential
    situations where claims could be alleged that our products
    infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party.
    Other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include
    guarantees of product and service performance and standby
    letters of credit for certain lease facilities. We have not
    recorded a liability related to these indemnification and
    guarantee provisions, and our guarantees and indemnification
    arrangements have not had any significant impact on our
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash
    flows.



Stock
    Repurchase Activities

In 2008, we repurchased $604.7 million or 25.1 million
    shares of common stock, under the following two stock repurchase
    programs authorized by our Board:

Under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved in
    2006 and 2007 (the “2006 Stock Repurchase Program”),
    we repurchased approximately 15.4 million shares of its
    common stock at an average price of $24.53 per share for a total
    purchase price of $376.8 million during 2008. As of
    December 31, 2008, we have repurchased and retired
    approximately 84.8 million shares of our common stock under
    the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program at an average price of $23.58
    per share, and the program had no remaining authorized funds
    available for future stock repurchases.

The Board approved another $1.0 billion stock repurchase
    program in March 2008 (the “2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program”). Under this program, we repurchased approximately
    9.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price
    of $23.43 per share for a total purchase price of
    $227.9 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the
    2008 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of
    $772.1 million.

All shares of common stock purchased under the 2006 and 2008
    Stock Repurchase Programs have been retired. Future share
    repurchases under our 2008 Stock Repurchase Program will be
    subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time
    and will be made from time to time in private transactions or
    open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other
    legal requirements. This program may be discontinued at any
    time. See Note 14 — Subsequent Events in Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2009.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resource Requirements

Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating
    activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic
    relationships we may make in the future. Additionally, if we
    were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under
    our 2008 Stock Repurchase Program, our liquidity may be
    impacted. We also have a substantial portion of our cash and
    investment balances held overseas and may be subject to
    U.S. taxes if repatriated.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe
    that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
    long-term investments, together with cash generated from
    operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee
    stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase
    plan will be sufficient to fund our operations, debt, and growth
    for at least the next 12 months. We believe our working
    capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for
    capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity
    requirements associated with our existing operations during the
    same period. However, our future liquidity and capital
    requirements may vary materially from those now planned
    depending on many factors, including:

•

the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit
    margins;

•

our business, product, capital expenditures, and research and
    development plans;

•

the market acceptance of our products;

•

repurchases of our common stock;

•

issuance and repayment of debt;

•

litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments;

•

volume price discounts and customer rebates;

•

the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain;

•

acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products, or
    technologies;

•

changes in our compensation policies;

•

capital improvements for new and existing facilities;



•

technological advances;

•

our competitors’ responses to our products;

•

our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers;

•

possible future investments in raw material and finished goods
    inventories;

•

expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any;

•

tax expense associated with stock-based awards;

•

issuance of stock-based awards and the related payment in cash
    for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during
    future years;

•

the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases
    under our equity incentive plans; and

•

general economic conditions and specific conditions in our
    industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in
    global credit and financial markets, international conflicts,
    and related uncertainties.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types,
    and maturities. In addition, a portion of our cash and
    marketable securities are held in

non-U.S. domiciled

countries. Our marketable securities are generally classified as

available-for-sale

and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance
    sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as
    a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss).

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material
    adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
    Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material
    impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do
    not currently hedge these interest rate exposures.

The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value
    of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2008, and
    2007, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in
    millions):

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes
    other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the
    changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in
    interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical
    parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus
    50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and
    150 BPS, which are representative of the historical
    movements in the Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign
    Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations
    in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for
    speculative or trading purposes.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate
    variability in gains and losses generated from the
    re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are
    carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income
    (expense) in the same period as the changes in the fair value
    from the re-measurement of the underlying assets and
    liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities
    between one and two months.

Our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in
    U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses are denominated in
    U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including
    the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen.
    Periodically, we use foreign currency forward

and/or

option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives
    are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less
    than one year. The effective portion of the derivative’s
    gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income and, upon occurrence of the
    forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the
    line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which
    the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of
    the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in
    other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of
    operations. The increase in operating expenses including
    research and development, sales and marketing, as well as
    general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency
    fluctuations was approximately 1% in 2008.

Equity
    Price Risk

Our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities is inherently
    exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. We
    monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic
    basis. In the event that the carrying value of the equity
    investments exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline
    in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying
    value to its current fair value. In 2008, we realized an
    impairment charge of $3.5 million on a publicly-traded
    equity security due to a sustained decline in the fair value, in
    excess of six months, of the investment below its cost basis
    that we judged to be other than temporary. We do not purchase
    our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or
    speculative purposes. The aggregate fair value of our marketable
    equity securities was $4.4 million and $8.6 million as
    of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. A
    hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our
    portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities would result in
    an immaterial loss.

In addition to publicly-traded securities, we have also invested
    in privately-held companies. These investments are carried at
    cost. In 2008, we realized an impairment charge of
    $11.3 million on minority equity investments in
    privately-held companies that we judged to be other than
    temporary. The aggregate cost of our investments in
    privately-held companies was $14.2 million and
    $23.3 million as of December 31, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Juniper Networks, Inc. as of December 31, 2008, and 2007,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Juniper Networks, Inc. at
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, and the consolidated results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, present fairly in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, Juniper Networks, Inc. changed its method of
    accounting for uncertain tax positions as of January 1,
    2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Juniper Networks, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    March 2, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited Juniper Network, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Juniper Networks,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
    of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 of
    Juniper Networks, Inc. and our report dated March 2, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the
    “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    for the Company. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision
    of the Company’s principal executive and principal
    financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    Company’s financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets
    that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the framework set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.

Based on that assessment, management concluded
    that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been
    audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent
    registered public accounting firm that audits the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report
    preceding this report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or the
    “Company”) designs, develops, and sells products and
    services that together provide its customers with
    high-performance network infrastructure that creates responsive
    and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of
    services and applications over a single Internet Protocol
    (“IP”)-based network. Beginning in the first quarter
    of 2008, the Company realigned its business groups, which
    resulted in the following two segments: Infrastructure and SLT.
    The Company’s Infrastructure segment primarily offers
    scalable router and Ethernet switching products that are used to
    control and direct network traffic. The Company’s SLT
    segment offers networking solutions that meet a broad array of
    its customers’ priorities, from securing the network and
    the data on the network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and
    acceleration of applications across a distributed network. Both
    segments offer worldwide services, including technical support
    and professional services, as well as educational and training
    programs to their customers.

Basis
    of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements, which include the Company
    and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in accordance
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All
    inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related
    disclosures requires management to make judgments, assumptions,
    and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.
    Estimates are used for revenue recognition, allowance for sales
    returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for contract
    manufacturer obligations, allowance for warranty costs,
    stock-based compensation, goodwill and other impairments, income
    taxes, litigation and settlement costs, and other loss
    contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions
    on current facts, historical experience and various other
    factors that it believes to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially
    from management’s estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with an original
    maturity of three months or less are classified as cash and cash
    equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand,
    demand deposits with banks, highly liquid investments in money
    market funds, commercial paper, government securities,
    certificates of deposit, and corporate debt securities, which
    are readily convertible into, cash.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of
    securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such
    classification as of each balance sheet date. The Company’s
    investments in publicly-traded debt and equity securities are
    classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale investments
    are initially recorded at cost and periodically adjusted to fair
    value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and
    losses on these investments are reported as a separate component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains
    and losses and declines in value judged to be other than
    temporary are determined based on the specific identification
    method and are reported in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

The Company recognizes an impairment charge for
    available-for-sale investments when a decline in the fair value
    of its investments below the cost basis is determined to be
    other than temporary. The Company considers various factors in
    determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including
    the length of time the



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

investment has been in a loss position, the extent to which the
    fair value has been less than the Company’s cost basis, the
    investment’s financial condition, and near-term prospects
    of the investee. If the Company determines that the decline in
    an investment’s fair value is other than temporary, the
    difference is recognized as an impairment loss in its
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company’s non-qualified compensation plan, which
    invests in mutual funds are classified as trading securities and
    reported at fair value. The realized and unrealized holding
    gains and losses, as well as the offsetting compensation
    expense, are reported in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Privately-Held
    Equity Investments

The Company has minority equity investments in privately-held
    companies. These investments are included in other long-term
    assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are carried at
    cost, adjusted for any impairment, as the Company does not have
    a controlling interest and does not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over these companies. These investments
    are inherently high risk as the market for technologies or
    products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage
    at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets
    may never be significant. The Company monitors these investments
    for impairment by considering financial, operational, and
    economic data and makes appropriate reductions in carrying
    values when necessary.

Fair
    Value Measurement

The Company records its financial instruments that are accounted
    for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

(“SFAS 115”), and derivative contracts at
    fair value. The determination of fair value is based upon the
    fair value framework established by SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 provides that a fair value measurement assumes
    that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability
    occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in
    the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market
    for the asset or liability. The carrying value of the
    Company’s financial instruments including cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, accrued compensation, and
    other accrued liabilities, approximates fair market value due to
    the relatively short period of time to maturity. The fair value
    of investments is determined using quoted market prices for
    those securities or similar financial instruments.

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations
    of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
    investments, and accounts receivable. The Company invests only
    in high-quality credit instruments and maintains its cash, cash
    equivalents, and available-for-sale investments in fixed income
    securities, and money market funds with high-quality
    institutions. Deposits held with banks, including those held in
    foreign branches of global banks, may exceed the amount of
    insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be
    redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk.

Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
    diversified due to the number of entities comprising the
    Company’s customer base and their dispersion across
    different geographic locations throughout the world. The Company
    performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
    generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable.
    The Company maintains reserves for potential bad debt and
    historically such losses have been within management’s
    expectations. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of
    the Company’s total net revenues for 2008. One customer
    accounted for 12.8% and 14.3% of total net revenues during 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

The Company relies on sole suppliers for certain of its
    components such as ASICs and custom sheet metal. Additionally,
    the Company relies primarily on a limited number of significant
    independent contract manufacturers for the production of all of
    its products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to
    fulfill supply requirements of the Company could negatively
    impact future operating results.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method over the lesser of the estimated useful life, generally
    one and half to five years, or the lease term of the respective
    assets. The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the
    lesser of the expected life of the lease or the assets, up to a
    maximum of ten years. Land is not subject to depreciation.

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets
    resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using
    the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management
    based on the fair value of assets received. Identifiable
    intangible assets are comprised of purchased trademarks,
    developed technologies, customer relationships, maintenance
    contracts, and other intangible assets. Goodwill is not subject
    to amortization but is subject to annual assessment, at a
    minimum, for impairment by applying fair-value based tests.
    Future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to
    earnings. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective
    estimated useful lives ranging from two to nineteen years.

Impairment

The Company evaluates long-lived assets held for use for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An
    asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the
    future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If an
    asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    asset exceeds its fair value. The Company assesses the
    recoverability of its long-lived and intangible assets by
    determining whether the unamortized balances are greater than
    the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows of the related
    assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on
    projected discounted future net cash flows.

The Company evaluates goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis
    and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by
    comparing the reporting unit’s carrying value, including
    goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair
    values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination
    of the income approach and the market approach. If the carrying
    value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is
    considered impaired, and a second step is performed to measure
    the amount of the impairment loss, if any. As discussed in
    Note 5, in the second quarter of 2006, the Company
    concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired and
    recorded an impairment charge for the period. The Company
    conducted its annual impairment test as of November 1,
    2008, 2007, and 2006, and determined that the carrying value of
    its remaining goodwill was not impaired. Future impairment
    indicators, including sustained declines in the Company’s
    market capitalization or a decrease in revenue or profitability
    levels, could require additional impairment charges to be
    recorded.

Revenue
    Recognition

Juniper Networks sells products and services through its direct
    sales force and through its strategic distribution relationships
    and value-added resellers. The Company’s products are
    integrated with software that is essential to the functionality
    of the equipment. The Company also provides unspecified upgrades
    and enhancements related to the integrated software through
    maintenance contracts for most of its products. Accordingly, the
    Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Statement of
    Position

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, and all related
    interpretations. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has
    occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
    collectability is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement
    generally consists of sales contracts, or agreements, and
    customer purchase orders. Shipping terms and related documents,
    or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, are
    used to



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

verify delivery or performance. In instances where the Company
    has outstanding obligations related to product delivery or the
    final acceptance of the product, revenue is deferred until all
    the delivery and acceptance criteria have been met. The Company
    assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based
    on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to
    refund or adjustment. Collectability is assessed based on the
    creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks
    and the customer’s payment history to the Company. Accounts
    receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts,
    estimated customer returns and pricing credits.

For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of
    products that include services, the Company allocates revenue to
    each element using the residual method based on VSOE of fair
    value of the undelivered items. Under the residual method, the
    amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the
    total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of
    any undelivered elements. VSOE of fair value is based on the
    price charged when the element is sold separately. If VSOE of
    fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist,
    revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of:
    (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value
    can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered
    element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized
    ratably over the contractual support period. The Company
    accounts for multiple agreements with a single customer as one
    arrangement if the contractual terms

and/or

substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so
    closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single
    arrangement.

For sales to direct end-users and value-added resellers, the
    Company recognizes product revenues upon transfer of title and
    risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is the
    Company’s practice to identify an end-user prior to
    shipment to a value-added reseller. For end-users and
    value-added resellers, the Company has no significant
    obligations for future performance such as rights of return or
    pricing credits. A portion of the Company’s sales are made
    through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing
    credits or rights of return. Product revenue on sales made
    through these distributors is recognized upon sell-through as
    reported by the distributors to the Company. Deferred revenue on
    shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor
    pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be
    realized upon sell-through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of
    the related product costs of revenues.

The Company sells certain interests in accounts receivable on a
    non-recourse basis as part of a distributor accounts receivable
    financing arrangement primarily with one major financing
    company. The Company recognizes the sale of accounts receivable
    to the financing provider according to SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and
    Extinguishment of Liabilities, a replacement of
    FAS 125

. The Company records cash received under this
    arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as short-term debt
    with a balance of $33.0 million and $10.0 million as
    of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated product
    returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price
    protection, in the same period that the related revenue is
    recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical
    sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria
    included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the
    time. In addition, the Company reports revenues net of sales
    taxes.

Shipping charges billed to customers are included in product
    revenues and the related shipping costs are included in cost of
    product revenues. Costs associated with cooperative advertising
    programs are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenues
    at the time the related sales are recognized.

Services include maintenance, training, and professional
    services. In addition to providing unspecified upgrades and
    enhancements on a when and if available basis, the
    Company’s maintenance contracts include

24-hour

technical support as well as hardware repair and replacement
    parts. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue
    from maintenance contracts is deferred and is generally
    recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is
    generally one to three years. Revenue from training and
    professional services is recognized as the services are
    completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is
    generally one year or less.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the
    Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer
    accounts. The Company regularly reviews its receivables that
    remain outstanding past their applicable payment terms and
    establishes allowance and potential write-offs by considering
    factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of
    the accounts receivable balances, and current economic
    conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.

Warranties

Juniper Networks generally offers a one-year warranty on all of
    its hardware products and a

90-day

warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the
    products. The warranty generally includes parts and labor
    obtained through the Company’s

24-hour

service center. On occasion, the specific terms and conditions
    of those warranties vary. The Company accrues for warranty costs
    as part of its cost of revenues based on associated material
    costs, labor costs for customer support, and overhead at the
    time revenue is recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily
    based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product
    returns within the warranty period. Technical support labor and
    overhead costs are estimated primarily based upon historical
    trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the
    warranty period. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty
    liability include the number of installed units, its estimates
    of anticipated rates of warranty claims, costs per claim, and
    estimated support labor costs and the associated overhead. The
    Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded
    warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

Contract
    Manufacturer Liabilities and Inventories

The Company outsources most of its manufacturing, repair, and
    supply chain management operations to its independent contract
    manufacturers and a significant portion of its cost of revenues
    consists of payments to them. Its independent contract
    manufacturers procure components and manufacture the
    Company’s products based on the Company’s demand
    forecasts. These forecasts are based on the Company’s
    estimates of future demand for the Company products, which are
    in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from the
    Company’s sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for
    overall market conditions. The Company establishes accrued
    liabilities, included in other current accrued liabilities on
    its consolidated balance sheets, for carrying costs and obsolete
    material exposures for excess components purchased based on
    historical trends.

In addition, the Company purchases a small amount of strategic
    component inventory, which is included in other assets, and
    stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs associated with
    products shipped to distributors not yet recognized as revenue
    is recorded net of the related deferred product revenue. Service
    related spares and demonstration equipment are expensed to costs
    of service revenue and sales and marketing expense,
    respectively, when purchased.

Research
    and Development

Costs to research, design, and develop the Company’s
    products are expensed as incurred. Software development costs
    are capitalized beginning when a product’s technological
    feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
    available for general release to customers. Generally, the
    Company’s products are released soon after technological
    feasibility has been established. As a result, costs subsequent
    to achieving technological feasibility have not been
    significant, and all software development costs have been
    expensed as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as
    incurred. Advertising expense was $5.0 million,
    $4.8 million, and $6.8 million, for 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively.

Loss
    Contingencies

The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss
    contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.
    Management considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an
    asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability
    to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss
    contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it
    is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
    estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information
    available to its management to determine whether such accruals
    should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes,
    litigation, and other legal actions. The Company records a
    charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a
    loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are
    met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the
    financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset
    had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date
    of the financial statements, and (ii) the range of loss can
    be reasonably estimated. The actual liability in any such
    matters may be materially different from the Company’s
    estimates, which could result in the need to adjust the
    liability and record additional expenses.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
    with SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and
    recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards
    made to employees and directors including employee stock
    options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance
    share awards, and employee stock purchases under the
    Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated
    fair values. SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the
    fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an
    option pricing model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton
    option pricing model and incorporates a Monte Carlo simulation
    when appropriate to determine the fair value of stock-based
    awards under SFAS 123R. The value of the portion of the
    award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
    expense over the requisite service periods in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
    Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, included:
    (i) compensation expense for stock-based awards granted
    prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 31, 2005,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the provisions of SFAS 123 and (ii) compensation
    expense for the stock-based awards granted subsequent to
    December 31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R.
    Compensation expense for expected-to-vest stock-based awards
    that were granted on or prior to December 31, 2005, was
    valued under the multiple-option approach and will continue to
    be amortized using the accelerated attribution method.
    Subsequent to December 31, 2005, compensation expense for
    expected-to-vest stock-based awards is valued under the
    single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis,
    net of estimated forfeitures.

Derivatives

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its market
    exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. The
    Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or
    trading purposes.

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate
    variability in gains and losses generated from the
    re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are
    carried at fair value with changes recorded in interest and
    other income, net. Changes in the fair value of these
    derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the
    underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such
    derivatives are classified as operating activities. These
    foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities between one
    and two months.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company also uses foreign currency forward or option
    contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives
    are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less
    than one year. The effective portion of the derivative’s
    gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the
    forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the
    operating expense line item to which the hedged transaction
    relates. The Company records any ineffectiveness of the hedging
    instruments, which was immaterial during 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    in interest and other income, net on its Consolidated Statements
    of Operations. Cash flows from such hedges are classified as
    operating activities.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax
    liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of
    certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
    differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates
    that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which
    those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The
    Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax
    assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or
    recovered from future taxable income based on the realization
    criteria set forth under SFAS 109. To the extent that the
    Company believes any amounts are not more likely than not to be
    realized, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
    its deferred tax assets. The Company believes it is more likely
    than not that future income from the reversal of the deferred
    tax liabilities and forecasted income will be sufficient to
    fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event
    the Company determines that all or part of the net deferred tax
    assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the
    valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period
    such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company
    subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously
    determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation
    allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment
    to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such
    determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax
    liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
    application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes
    potential liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and the
    extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Financial
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which is a change in accounting
    for income taxes. FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to
    recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for
    in accordance with SFAS 109, and it seeks to reduce the
    diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of
    measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. The
    first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
    determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that
    it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
    on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation
    processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit
    as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being
    realized upon settlement. Additionally, FIN 48 provides
    guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and
    transition. The application of FIN 48 may increase an
    entity’s future effective tax rates and its future
    intra-period effective tax rate volatility. As of
    January 1, 2007, the Company’s cumulative effect of
    applying FIN 48 was a $19.2 million increase to the
    opening balance of accumulated deficit and a $1.0 million
    increase to goodwill.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a
    period from transactions and other events and circumstances from
    non-owner sources. The Company has presented its comprehensive
    income as part of its Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Other comprehensive income includes
    net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities
    and net foreign currency translation gains (losses) that are
    excluded from net income, and unrealized gains (losses) on
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations with

non-U.S. dollar

functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars using
    exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and
    expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using
    weighted-average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency
    translation gains and losses were not material for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. The effect of
    exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign
    currencies was immaterial in the years presented.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

FAS 140-4

and FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46(R)-8,

Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers
    of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities

(“FSP 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8”), which amends
    SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS 140”), to require public entities to
    provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial
    assets. It also amends FIN 46 (revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46(R)”), to require public enterprises,
    including sponsors that have a variable interest in a variable
    interest entity, to provide additional disclosures about their
    involvement with variable interest entities. The provisions of
    the FSP that amend SFAS 140 and FIN 46(R)-8 are
    effective for the first reporting period ended after
    December 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did
    not impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations
    or financial condition.

In October 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 157-3,

Determining Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That
    Is Not Active

(“FSP 157-3”).

FSP 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157,

Fair
    Value Measurements,

in an inactive market. It demonstrates
    how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the
    market for that financial asset is inactive.

FSP 157-3

was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which
    financial statements had not been issued. The implementation of
    this standard did not impact the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial condition.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”)

14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

(“FSP APB

14-1”).

FSP APB

14-1

requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that
    may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to
    separately account for the liability (debt) and equity
    (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner
    that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing
    rate. FSP APB

14-1

must be
    applied retrospectively to previously issued convertible
    instruments that may be settled in cash or partial cash as well
    as prospectively to newly issued instruments. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51

(“SFAS 160”).
    SFAS 160 addresses the accounting and reporting standards
    for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other
    than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income
    attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest,
    changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation
    of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary
    is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure
    requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the
    interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling
    owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 on
    January 1, 2009, will not have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial
    condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141

(“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
    non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The statement also
    provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination and determines what
    information to disclose to enable users of the financial
    statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
    business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for financial

statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008. Earlier application of SFAS 141R is
    prohibited. Accordingly, any business combinations the Company
    may engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing
    GAAP until January 1, 2009. The impact of SFAS 141R
    will depend upon the nature, terms, and size of the acquisitions
    the Company consummates after the effective date.

Reclassifications

In 2008, the Company realigned its organizational structure to
    include its Service business as a component of the related
    Infrastructure or SLT business groups. Prior year amounts have
    been reclassified to reflect the 2008 segment structure, which
    now includes service revenues and operating results in
    Infrastructure and SLT segments. Accordingly, the Company has
    revised the presentation of its segment information for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, and 2006, in
    Note 11 — Segment Information. None of the
    changes impacts the Company’s previously reported
    consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

Note 2.

Net
    Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing income
    (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net
    income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive
    potential shares that were outstanding during the period.
    Dilutive potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon
    conversion of the Senior Notes, common shares issuable upon
    exercise of stock options, and vesting of restricted stock units.

The Company excludes stock options with exercise prices that are
    greater than the average market price from the calculation of
    diluted net income per share because their effect would be
    anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2008, and
    2007, approximately 33.0 million and 11.5 million
    common stock equivalents, respectively, were excluded in the
    computation of diluted net income per share because their effect
    would have been anti-dilutive.

As a result of the net loss for the year ended December 31,
    2006, all dilutive potential common shares were excluded in the
    computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect
    would have been anti-dilutive.

In 2008, the Company realized an impairment charge of
    $3.5 million on a publicly-traded equity security due to a
    sustained decline in the fair value of the investment below its
    cost basis that the Company judged to be other than temporary.
    There was no significant realized gain or loss from the sale of
    available-for-sale securities in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The
    Company generated cash proceeds of $499.4 million,
    $1,029.1 million, and $632.1 million from maturities
    and sales of our available-for-sale investments during 2008,
    2007, and 2006, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately 26
    investments that were in an unrealized loss position. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately 46
    investments that were in an unrealized loss position. The gross
    unrealized losses related to these investments were due to
    changes in interest rates. The contractual terms of these
    investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at
    a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Given
    that the Company has the ability and intent to hold each of
    these investments until a recovery of the fair values, which may
    be maturity, the Company did not consider these investments to
    be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2008,
    and 2007. The Company reviews its investments to identify and
    evaluate investments that have an indication of possible
    impairment. The Company aggregated its investments by category
    and length of time the securities have been in a continuous
    unrealized loss position.

The following table shows a summary of the fair value and
    unrealized losses of the Company’s investments as of

Minority
    Equity Investments

As of December 31, 2008, and 2007, the carrying values of
    the Company’s minority equity investments in privately-held
    companies of $14.2 million and $23.3 million,
    respectively, were included in other long-term assets in the
    consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, the
    Company invested a total of $4.6 million,
    $4.1 million, and $7.3 million, respectively, in
    privately-held companies.

The Company’s minority equity investments in privately-held
    companies are carried at cost as the Company does not have a
    controlling interest and does not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over these companies. The Company adjusts
    its minority equity investments for any impairment if the fair
    value exceeds the carrying value of the respective assets.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In 2008, the Company recognized losses of $11.3 million due
    to the impairment of minority equity investments in
    privately-held companies that the Company judged to be other
    than temporary. In addition, the Company had a minority equity
    investment of $2.4 million in a privately-held company that
    was acquired by a third party for which the Company received a
    payment of $2.1 million as of December 31, 2008, and
    anticipates the receipt of the remaining $0.3 million in
    2009. In 2007, one of the Company’s minority equity
    investments completed an initial public offering
    (“IPO”). Upon completion of the IPO, the Company
    reclassified the minority equity investment to
    available-for-sale investments and realized a gain of
    $6.7 million, based upon the market value at the time of
    IPO and the Company’s cost basis, during 2007. Subsequent
    to the IPO, the Company’s investment in this
    publicly-traded entity is included in available-for-sale
    investments.

Note 4.

Fair
    Value Measurements

SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants at the
    measurement date. SFAS 157 assumes that the transaction to
    sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal
    or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and
    establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall
    be determined based on the assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Fair
    Value Hierarchy

The Company determines the fair values of its financial
    instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in
    SFAS 157, which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. A financial asset or liability’s
    classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest
    level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
    The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad
    levels:

Level 1 — Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 — Inputs are quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are
    observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
    indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the
    full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 — Inputs are unobservable inputs based on
    our own assumptions.

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill

In the first quarter of 2008, the Company realigned its
    organizational structure to eliminate its Service segment and to
    include its service business into the related Infrastructure and
    SLT segments. As a result, the Company, with the assistance of
    an external service provider, reallocated goodwill of the former
    Service segment to the Infrastructure and SLT segments based on
    a relative fair value approach. Fair value was based on
    comparative

market values and discounted cash flows. There was no indication
    of impairment when goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting
    segments.

In 2008, there were no additions to goodwill. In 2007, goodwill
    increased $33.9 million primarily due to payments from
    escrow accounts of $32.8 million upon resolution of
    acquisition-related indemnity issues, as well as the
    distribution, from an escrow account, of approximately
    0.8 million shares of its common stock, with an aggregate
    fair value of $14.8 million. Additionally, goodwill
    increased by $1.0 million as the Company recorded the
    cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 in 2007. In 2006, the
    goodwill increase of $25.0 million was primarily
    attributable to the settlements of the Company’s escrow
    obligations. The Company released from its escrow accounts
    0.8 million shares of common stock, with a total market
    value of $10.3 million, and $2.0 million of its
    restricted cash for the indemnity obligations associated with
    past acquisitions. The Company also distributed
    $13.1 million of its restricted cash for the escrow
    obligations associated with the acquisition of Redline.

The Company performed a goodwill impairment review as of
    November 1, 2008, 2007, and 2006, and concluded that there
    was no impairment in 2008 and 2007. In 2006, the Company
    concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the SLT
    segment was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of
    $1,280.0 million, which was included in operating expenses.
    A significant portion of the goodwill was initially recorded
    based on stock prices at the time the related merger agreements
    were executed and announced. The impairment of goodwill in 2006
    was primarily attributable to the decline in the Company’s
    market capitalization that occurred over a period of
    approximately six months prior to the impairment review as of
    May 31, 2006 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the
    forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The first step of the 2006 impairment review was to compare the
    fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value,
    including the goodwill related to the respective reporting
    units. When performing the 2006 goodwill impairment review, the
    Company determined that it had four reporting units at the time
    of the impairment calculation, consisting of Infrastructure and
    Service, which are the same as the respective segments, as well
    as Security and Application Acceleration, which were the two
    components of SLT segment. The Company with the assistance of an
    external service provider, calculated the fair value of the
    reporting units using a combination of the income and market
    approaches. The income approach requires estimates of expected
    revenue, gross margin, and operating expenses in order to
    discount the sum of future cash flows using each particular
    business’ weighted average cost of capital. The
    Company’s growth estimates were based on historical data
    and internal estimates developed as part of its long-term
    planning process. The Company tested the reasonableness of the
    inputs and outcomes of its discounted cash flow analysis by
    comparing to available market data. In determining the carrying
    value of the reporting unit, the Company allocated the fair
    values of shared tangible net assets to each reporting unit
    based on revenue derived by that reporting unit. As the fair
    values of the Security and Application Acceleration reporting
    units were lower than the allocated book values, goodwill was
    considered impaired. As a result, the Company performed step two
    of the goodwill impairment calculation for those two reporting
    units within the SLT segment in order to calculate the extent of
    the goodwill impairment.

During the second step of the 2006 goodwill impairment review,
    management calculated the fair value of the Company’s
    tangible and intangible net assets with the assistance of an
    external service provider. Identified intangible assets were
    valued specifically for each reporting unit tested. The
    difference between the calculated fair value of each reporting
    unit and the sum of the identified net assets results in the
    residual value of goodwill. Future impairment indicators,
    including sustained declines in the Company’s market
    capitalization, could require additional impairment charges.

    Amortization expense of purchased intangible assets of
    $38.5 million and $5.5 million were included in
    operating expenses and cost of product revenues in 2008. During
    2008, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
    $5.0 million in operating expenses due to the phase-out of
    its DX products. During 2007, the Company had no impairment on
    its purchased intangible assets. During 2006, the Company
    recorded an impairment charge of $3.4 million in operating
    expenses due to a significant decrease in forecasted revenues
    associated with Session Border Control (“SBC”)
    products.

    $101.8 million, and $76.2 million in 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash as of December 31, 2008, consisted of
    escrow accounts required by certain acquisitions completed in
    2005, the Directors & Officers (“D&O”)
    indemnification trust, and the India Gratuity Trust. The India
    Gratuity Trust was established in 2008 to cover statutory
    severance obligations in the event of termination of its India
    employees who have provided five or more years of continuous
    service. The D&O trust was established to secure the
    Company’s indemnification obligations to certain directors,
    officers, and other specified employees, arising from their
    activities as such, in the event that the Company does not
    provide or is financially incapable of providing
    indemnification. In 2008, the Company made no distributions from
    restricted cash and increased its restricted cash by
    $8.1 million to fund both the India Gratuity and D&O
    Trusts due to overall growth of the Company.

In 2007, the Company distributed $11.5 million,
    $1.6 million, and $4.6 million of its restricted cash
    upon the settlement of certain escrow obligations associated
    with the acquisitions of Funk Software, Acorn Packet Solutions,
    and Kagoor Networks, respectively. The Company also added
    $8.9 million to its D&O insurance trust to increase
    coverage due to the overall growth of the Company.

In 2006, the Company reduced restricted cash by
    $5.9 million as its deposit requirements for standby
    letters of credits issued for facility leases was removed. The
    Company also distributed $13.1 million and
    $2.0 million of its restricted cash upon the settlement of
    certain escrow obligations associated with the Redline Networks
    and Kagoor Networks acquisitions, respectively.

The Company had no restructuring and acquisition-related
    expenses in 2008. Restructuring and acquisition-related expenses
    of $0.7 million in 2007, primarily consisted of a
    $1.1 million bonus accrual payable to employees of a past
    acquisition, net of $0.4 million in adjustments made to
    restructuring liabilities. Restructuring and acquisition-related
    expenses of $5.9 million in 2006 primarily consisted of the
    $5.6 million bonus and earn-out accrual associated with the
    Funk and Acorn acquisitions and $0.3 million in net
    restructuring charges and acquisition-related restructuring
    charges.

In 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred $6.0 million and
    $20.5 million, respectively, in professional fees for the
    costs of external service providers used in the completion of
    its internal stock option investigation. The Company did not
    incur any such costs in 2008.

The Company recognized stock option amendment and tax-related
    charges of $8.0 million and $10.1 million in 2007 and
    2006, respectively, pertaining to the amendment of stock options
    and to the settlement with the IRS for employment tax
    assessments primarily related to the timing of tax deposits
    related to employee stock option exercises. The Company did not
    incur any such charges in 2008.

In 2008, the Company incurred a $9.0 million expense for
    the settlement of its shareholder derivative lawsuits. See
    Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies under

“Legal Proceedings.”

In 2007, the Company

Operating
    Leases

The Company leases its facilities under operating leases that
    expire at various times, the longest of which expires in January
    2017. Future minimum payments under the non-cancelable operating
    leases, net of committed sublease income, totaled
    $208.6 million as of December 31, 2008. Rental expense
    for 2008, 2007, and 2006 was approximately $58.0 million,
    $48.7 million, and $40.3 million, respectively.

Purchase
    Commitments

In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate
    component supply, the Company’s contract manufacturers
    place non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders
    for components based on the Company’s build forecasts. As
    of December 31, 2008, there were NCNR component orders
    placed by the contract manufacturers with a value of
    $86.8 million. The contract manufacturers use the
    components to build products based on the Company’s
    forecasts and on purchase orders the Company has received from
    customers. Generally, the Company does not own the components
    and title to the products transfers from the contract
    manufacturers to the Company and immediately to the
    Company’s customers upon delivery at a designated shipment
    location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold
    for specified periods of time, the Company may incur carrying
    charges or obsolete materials charges for components that the
    contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet the
    Company’s forecast or customer orders. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had accrued
    $30.4 million based on its estimate of such charges.

Tax
    Liabilities

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $91.2 million
    included in current and long-term liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. It is
    reasonably possible that the Company may reach agreement on
    certain issues and, as a result, the amount of the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately
    $13.0 million within the next 12 months. At this time,
    the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of
    the timing of payments related to the additional
    $78.2 million in liability due to uncertainties in the
    timing of tax audit outcomes.

Other
    Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had indemnity-related
    escrow obligations of $2.3 million and a joint development
    agreement requiring quarterly payments of $3.5 million
    through January 2010. In 2008, the Company entered into a
    five-year, $36.4 million data center hosting agreement. As
    of December 31, 2008, $26.4 million remained unpaid
    under the data center hosting agreement with the remaining
    commitment expected to be paid



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

through the end of April 2013. Additionally, in 2008, the
    Company entered into a three-year, $22.7 million software
    subscription agreement to replace a previous software
    subscription requiring payment of $5.0 million in January
    2009. As of December 31, 2008, $22.7 million remained
    unpaid under the software subscription agreement with the
    remaining commitment expected to be paid through the end of
    January 2011.

Guarantees
    and Letters of Credit

The Company has entered into agreements with some of its
    customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to
    potential situations where claims could be alleged that the
    Company’s products infringe the intellectual property
    rights of a third party. Other guarantees or indemnification
    arrangements include guarantees of product and service
    performance and standby letters of credit for certain lease
    facilities. The Company has not recorded a liability related to
    these indemnification and guarantee provisions and its
    guarantees and indemnification arrangements have not had any
    significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in
    the ordinary course of business, such as employment or
    intellectual property claims, including the matters described
    below. The outcome of any such matters is currently not
    determinable. Although the Company does not expect that any such
    legal claims or litigation will ultimately have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or
    results of operations, an adverse result in one or more of such
    matters could negatively affect the Company’s consolidated
    financial results in the period in which they occur.

Federal
    Derivative Lawsuits

Between May 24, 2006, and August 17, 2006, seven
    purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of
    California against the Company and certain of its current and
    former officers and directors. The lawsuits alleged that the
    Company’s officers and directors either participated in
    illegal back-dating of stock option grants or allowed it to
    happen. On October 19, 2006, the Court ordered the
    consolidation of these actions as

In Re Juniper Derivative
    Actions

,

No. 06-03396,

and appointed as the lead plaintiffs Timothy Hill,
    Employer-Teamsters Local Nos. 175 & 505 Pension
    Trust Fund, and Indiana State District Council of Laborers
    and HOD Carriers Pension Fund. Lead plaintiffs filed a
    consolidated complaint on April 11, 2007. The consolidated
    complaint asserted causes of action for violations of federal
    securities laws, violations of California securities laws,
    breaches of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breaches of
    fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, breach of
    contract, unjust enrichment, gross mismanagement, and insider
    selling and misappropriation of information. The consolidated
    complaint also demanded an accounting and rescission of
    allegedly improper stock option grants. The Company formed a
    Special Litigation Committee to determine whether it was in the
    best interest of Juniper Networks and its shareholders to pursue
    any of the claims asserted in the derivative litigation. The
    Special Litigation Committee was authorized to pursue, settle,
    or release such claims. The plaintiffs and the Company reached
    an agreement on a settlement of the federal derivative
    litigation and the state derivative litigation discussed below.
    The Company accrued an aggregate of $9.0 million expense,
    which was paid by December 31, 2008, in connection with
    both of these settlements. On August 26, 2008, plaintiffs
    filed the stipulation of settlement and a motion for preliminary
    approval of the settlement. On September 8, 2008, the Court
    entered an Order preliminarily approving the derivative
    settlement and providing for notice to shareholders. On
    November 13, 2008, the Court entered an Order granting
    final approval for the derivative settlement and dismissing the
    federal derivative action.

State
    Derivative Lawsuits — California

On May 24, 2006, and June 2, 2006, two purported
    shareholder derivative actions were filed in the
    Santa Clara County Superior Court in the State of
    California against the Company and certain of its current and
    former officers and directors. These two actions were
    consolidated as

In re Juniper Networks Derivative Litigation,

No. 1:06CV064294, by order dated June 20, 2006. An
    amended consolidated complaint was filed on April 9, 2007.
    The amended consolidated complaint alleged that certain of the
    Company’s current and former officers and directors either
    participated in illegal back-dating of stock options or allowed
    it to happen. The complaint asserted causes of action for unjust
    enrichment, breach of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross
    mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, insider selling and
    misappropriation of information, and violations of California
    securities laws. Plaintiffs also demanded an accounting and
    rescission of allegedly improper stock options grants, and a
    constructive trust of proceeds derived from allegedly illicit
    stock options. The Company formed a Special Litigation Committee
    to determine whether it was in the best interest of Juniper
    Networks and its shareholders to pursue any of the claims
    asserted in the derivative litigation. The Special Litigation
    Committee was authorized to pursue, settle, or release such
    claims. The plaintiffs and the Company reached an agreement on a
    settlement of the federal derivative litigation discussed above
    and the state derivative litigation. The Company accrued an
    aggregate of $9.0 million expense, which was paid by
    December 31, 2008, in connection with both of these
    settlements. On December 3, 2008, the Company’s
    Special Litigation Committee filed a stipulation of settlement
    in the state derivative actions, and the Court approved the
    stipulation on December 4, 2008.

Federal
    Securities Class Action

On July 14, 2006, and August 29, 2006, two purported
    class actions were filed in the Northern District of California
    against the Company and certain of the Company’s current
    and former officers and directors. On November 20, 2006,
    the Court consolidated the two actions as

In re Juniper
    Networks, Inc. Securities Litigation,

No. C06-04327-JW,

and appointed the New York City Pension Funds as lead
    plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated
    Class Action Complaint on January 12, 2007, and filed
    an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on
    April 9, 2007. The Amended Consolidated Complaint alleges
    that the defendants violated federal securities laws by
    manipulating stock option grant dates to coincide with low stock
    prices and issuing false and misleading statements including,
    among others, incorrect financial statements due to the improper
    accounting of stock option grants. The Amended Consolidated
    Complaint asserts claims for violations of the Securities Act of
    1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all
    persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Juniper
    Networks’ publicly-traded securities from July 12,
    2001, through and including August 10, 2006. On
    June 7, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss
    certain of the claims, and a hearing was held on
    September 10, 2007. On March 31, 2008, the Court
    issued an order granting in part and denying in part the
    defendants’ motion to dismiss. The order dismissed with
    prejudice plaintiffs’ section 10(b) claim to the
    extent it was based on challenged statements made before
    July 14, 2001. The order also dismissed, with leave to
    amend, plaintiffs’ section 10(b) claim against Pradeep
    Sindhu. The order upheld all of plaintiffs’ remaining
    claims. Plaintiffs did not amend their complaint. Defendants
    filed their answer on June 23, 2008.

Calamore
    Proxy Statement Action

On March 28, 2007, an action titled

Jeanne M.
    Calamore v. Juniper Networks, Inc., et al.,

No. C-07-1772-JW,

was filed by Jeanne M. Calamore in the Northern District of
    California against the Company and certain of the Company’s
    current and former officers and directors. The complaint alleges
    that the proxy statement for the Company’s 2006 Annual
    Meeting of Stockholders contained various false and misleading
    statements in that it failed to disclose stock option backdating
    information. As a result, plaintiff seeks preliminary and
    permanent injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s
    2006 Equity Incentive Plan, including seeking to invalidate the
    plan and all equity awards granted and grantable thereunder. On
    May 21, 2007, the Company filed a motion to dismiss, and
    plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction. On
    July 19, 2007, the Court issued an order denying
    plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction and
    dismissing the complaint in its entirety with leave to amend.
    Plaintiff filed

    defendants’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, and entered
    final judgment in favor of defendants. On September 9,
    2008, plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal in the United States

    Defendants’ answering brief is due March 11, 2009.

IPO
    Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First
    Boston Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal
    Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG Cowen Securities
    Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase
    (Hambrecht & Quist LLC), J.P. Morgan
    Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith
    Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
    Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”),
    Juniper Networks and certain of Juniper Networks’ officers.
    This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the
    Company’s common stock in its initial public offering in
    June 1999 and the Company’s secondary offering in September
    1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that
    the prospectus pursuant to which shares of common stock were
    sold in the Company’s initial public offering and the
    Company’s subsequent secondary offering contained certain
    false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the
    practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation
    of shares of common stock in these offerings and their receipt
    of commissions from customers related to such allocations.
    Various plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar
    allegations concerning the initial public offerings of
    approximately 300 other issuers. These various cases pending in
    the Southern District of New York have been coordinated for
    pretrial proceedings as

In re Initial Public Offering
    Securities Litigation

, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs
    filed a consolidated amended complaint in the action against the
    Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in the
    coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October
    2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the case
    without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation. On
    February 19, 2003, the Court granted in part and denied in
    part the motion to dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims
    against the Company.

In June 2004, a stipulation of settlement and release of claims
    against the issuer defendants, including the Company, was
    submitted to the Court for approval. On August 31, 2005,
    the Court preliminarily approved the settlement. In December
    2006, the Appellate Court overturned the certification of
    classes in the six test cases that were selected by the
    underwriter defendants and plaintiffs in the coordinated
    proceedings (the action involving the Company is not one of the
    six test cases). Because class certification was a condition of
    the settlement, it was unlikely that the settlement would
    receive final Court approval. On June 25, 2007, the Court
    entered an order terminating the proposed settlement based upon
    a stipulation among the parties to the settlement. Plaintiffs
    have filed amended master allegations and amended complaints in
    the six focus cases. On March 26, 2008, the Court largely
    denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended
    complaints in the six test cases.

16(b)
    Demand

On October 3, 2007, a purported Juniper Networks
    shareholder filed a complaint for violation of
    Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which
    prohibits short-swing trading, against the Company’s IPO
    underwriters. The complaint, Vanessa Simmonds v. The
    Goldman Sachs Group, et al., Case

No. C07-015777,

in District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeks
    the recovery of short-swing profits. The Company is named as a
    nominal defendant. No recovery is sought from the Company in
    this matter.

IRS
    Notices of Proposed Adjustments

In 2007, the IRS opened an examination of the Company’s
    U.S. federal income tax and employment tax returns for the
    2004 fiscal year. Subsequently, the IRS extended their
    examination of the Company’s employment tax



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

returns to include fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The IRS has not
    yet concluded its examinations of these returns. In September
    2008, as part of its on-going audit of the U.S. federal
    income tax return, the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed
    Adjustment (“NOPA”) regarding the Company’s
    business credits. The Company is considering its response to the
    proposed adjustment by the IRS. The Company believes that it has
    adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome
    related to this proposed adjustment and the ultimate resolution
    of this matter is unlikely to have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of
    operations.

The IRS has concluded an audit of the Company’s federal
    income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004,
    the Company received a NOPA from the IRS. While the final
    resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is uncertain, the
    Company does not believe that the outcome of this matter will
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The
    Company is also under routine examination by certain state and

non-U.S. tax

authorities. The Company believes that it has adequately
    provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these
    audits.

Note 8.

Debt

Senior
    Convertible Notes

In 2003, the Company received $392.8 million of net
    proceeds from an offering of $400.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
    June 15, 2008 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior
    Notes were senior unsecured obligations, ranked on parity in
    right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and
    future senior unsecured debt, and ranked senior to all of the
    Company’s existing and future debt that expressly provided
    that it was subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bore no
    interest, but were convertible into shares of the Company’s
    common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior
    to maturity or their prior repurchase by the Company. The
    conversion rate was 49.6512 shares per each $1,000
    principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in
    certain circumstances. This was equivalent to a conversion price
    of approximately $20.14 per share. As of December 31, 2007,

Distributor
    Financing Arrangement

The Company recognizes the sale of accounts receivable primarily
    to one major financing provider according to SFAS 140. The
    Company introduced its distributor financing program in 2006 to
    strengthen its channel business by promoting greater distributor
    volume and improved customer service. The program does not, and
    is not intended to, affect the timing of revenue recognition
    because the Company only recognizes revenue upon sell-through.
    Under the financing arrangements, proceeds from the financing
    provider are due to the Company 30 days from the sale of
    the receivable. The Company pays the financing provider a
    financing fee based on the spread over LIBOR or SIBOR. In these
    transactions with a major financing provider, the Company has
    surrendered control over the transferred assets. The accounts
    receivable have been isolated from the Company and put beyond
    the reach of creditors, even in the event of bankruptcy. The
    purchaser of the accounts receivable balances has the right to
    pledge

    Statements — (Continued)

or exchange the assets transferred. The Company does not
    maintain effective control over the transferred assets through
    obligations or rights to redeem, transfer, or repurchase the
    receivables after they have been transferred.

Pursuant to the receivable financing arrangements for the sale
    of receivables, the Company sold net receivables of
    $427.2 million and $130.4 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. In 2008 and 2007, the Company received cash
    proceeds of $392.7 million and $95.4 million,
    respectively. The amounts owed by the financing provider
    recorded as accounts receivable on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2008, and
    December 31, 2007, were $73.9 million and
    $40.4 million, respectively.

The Company has determined that the portion of the receivable
    financed that has not been recognized as revenue should be
    accounted for as a financing transaction pursuant to EITF Issue

88-18,

Sales of Future Revenues.

As of December 31, 2008,
    and December 31, 2007, the estimated amounts of cash
    received from the financing provider that has not been
    recognized as revenue from its distributors was
    $33.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.

Stockholders’
    Equity

Stock
    Repurchase Activities

In 2008, the Company repurchased $604.7 million, or
    25.1 million shares of common stock, under two stock
    repurchase programs that were authorized by its Board of
    Directors (the “Board”).

Under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved in
    2006 and 2007 (the “2006 Stock Repurchase Program”),
    the Company repurchased approximately 15.4 million shares
    of its common stock at an average price of $24.53 per share for
    a total purchase price of $376.8 million in 2008. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company has repurchased and retired
    approximately 84.8 million shares of its common stock under
    the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program at an average price of $23.58
    per share, and the program has no remaining authorized funds
    available for future stock repurchases.

The Board approved another $1.0 billion stock repurchase
    program in March 2008 (the “2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program”). Under this program, the Company repurchased
    approximately 9.7 million shares of its common stock at an
    average price of $23.43 per share for a total purchase price of
    $227.9 million during 2008. As of December 31, 2008,
    the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds
    of $772.1 million.

All shares of common stock purchased under the 2006 and 2008
    Stock Repurchase Programs have been retired. Future share
    repurchases under the Company’s 2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances in
    place at the time and will be made from time to time in private
    transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities
    laws and other legal requirements. This program may be
    discontinued at any time. See Note 14 —
    Subsequent Events for discussion of our stock repurchase
    activity in 2009.

Convertible
    Preferred Stock

There are 10,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock
    with a par value of $0.00001 per share authorized for issuance.
    No preferred stock was issued and outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007.

    Option Plans

    Equity Incentive Plan

On May 18, 2006, the Company’s stockholders adopted
    the Company’s 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006
    Plan”) to enable the granting of incentive stock options,
    nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, restricted stock, stock
    appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units,
    deferred stock units, and dividend equivalents to the



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

    Statements — (Continued)

employees and consultants of the Company. The 2006 Plan also
    provides for the automatic, non-discretionary award of
    nonstatutory stock options to the Company’s non-employee
    members of the Board.

The maximum aggregate number of shares authorized under the 2006
    Plan is 64,500,000 shares of common stock, plus the
    addition of any shares subject to outstanding options under the
    Company’s Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Plan (the
    “1996 Plan”) and the Company’s 2000 Nonstatutory
    Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”) that subsequently
    expired unexercised after May 18, 2006, up to a maximum of
    75,000,000 additional shares of common stock.

Options granted under the 2006 Plan have a maximum term of five
    to seven years from the grant date, and generally vest and
    become exercisable over a four-year period. Subject to the terms
    of change of control severance agreements, and except for a
    limited number of shares allowed under the 2006 Plan, restricted
    stock, performance shares, RSUs, or deferred stock units that
    vest solely based on continuing employment or provision of
    services will vest in full no earlier than the three-year
    anniversary of the grant date, or in the event vesting is based
    on factors other than continued future provision of services,
    such awards will vest in full no earlier than the one-year
    anniversary of the grant date.

The 2006 Plan provides each non-employee director an automatic
    grant of an option to purchase 50,000 shares of common
    stock upon the date on which such individual first becomes a
    director, whether through election by the stockholders of the
    Company or appointment by the Board to fill a vacancy (the
    “First Option”). In addition, at each of the
    Company’s annual stockholder meetings (i) each
    non-employee director who was a non-employee director on the
    date of the prior year’s annual stockholder meeting shall
    be automatically granted RSUs for a number of shares equal to
    the Annual Value (as defined below), and (ii) each
    non-employee director who was not a non-employee director on the
    date of the prior year’s annual stockholder meeting shall
    receive a RSU award for a number of shares determined by
    multiplying the Annual Value by a fraction, the numerator of
    which is the number of days since the non-employee director
    received their First Option, and the denominator of which is
    365, rounded down to the nearest whole share. Each RSU award
    specified in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an
    “Annual Award.” The Annual Value means the number of
    RSUs equal to $125,000 divided by the average daily closing
    price of the Company’s common stock over the six month
    period ending on the last day of the fiscal year preceding the
    date of grant (for example, the period from July 1,
    2008 — December 31, 2008 for Annual Awards
    granted in May 2009). The First Option vests monthly over
    approximately three years from the grant date subject to the
    non-employee director’s continuous service on the Board.
    The Annual Award shall vest approximately one year from the
    grant date subject to the non-employee director’s
    continuous service on the Board. Under the 2006 Plan, options
    granted to non-employee directors have a maximum term of seven
    years.

    Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan

In July 2000, the Board adopted the Juniper Networks 2000
    Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (“2000 Plan”). The 2000
    Plan provided for the granting of nonstatutory stock options to
    employees, directors, and consultants. Options granted under the
    2000 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period
    beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten
    years. The Company had authorized 90,901,437 shares of
    common stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Effective
    May 18, 2006, additional equity awards under the 2000 Plan
    have been discontinued and new equity awards are being granted
    under the 2006 Plan. Remaining authorized shares under the 2000
    Plan that were not subject to outstanding awards as of
    May 18, 2006, were canceled on May 18, 2006. The 2000
    Plan will remain in effect as to outstanding equity awards
    granted under the plan prior to May 18, 2006.

Amended
    and Restated 1996 Stock Plan

The 1996 Plan provided for the granting of incentive stock
    options to employees and nonstatutory stock options to
    employees, directors, and consultants. On November 3, 2005,
    the Board adopted an amendment to the 1996 Plan to add the
    ability to issue RSUs under the 1996 Plan. Options granted under
    the 1996 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year
    period beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of
    ten years.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company had authorized 164,623,039 shares of common
    stock for issuance under the 1996 Plan. Effective May 18,
    2006, additional equity awards under the 1996 Plan have been
    discontinued and new equity awards are being granted under the
    2006 Plan. Remaining authorized shares under the 1996 Plan that
    were not subject to outstanding awards as of May 18, 2006,
    were canceled on May 18, 2006. The 1996 Plan will remain in
    effect as to outstanding equity awards granted under the plan
    prior to May 18, 2006.

Plans
    Assumed Upon Acquisition

In connection with past acquisitions, the Company assumed
    options and restricted stock under the stock plans of the
    acquired companies. The Company exchanged those options and
    restricted stock for Juniper Networks’ options and
    restricted stock and, in the case of the options, authorized the
    appropriate number of shares of common stock for issuance
    pursuant to those options. As of December 31, 2008, there
    were approximately 2.6 million common shares subject to
    outstanding awards under plans assumed through past
    acquisitions. There was no restricted stock subject to
    repurchase as of December 31, 2008, and 2007. There were no
    restricted stock repurchases during 2008 and 2007. During 2006,
    the Company repurchased an immaterial amount of restricted
    common stock in connection with employee terminations.

Equity
    Award Activity

In 2008, the Company granted RSUs covering approximately
    1.5 million shares of common stock to its employees under
    the 2006 Plan and performance share awards to eligible
    executives covering approximately 1.5 million shares of
    common stock. RSUs generally vest over a period of three to five
    years from the date of grant. Performance share awards generally
    vest from 2009 through 2012 provided that certain annual
    performance targets and other vesting criteria are met. Until
    vested, RSUs and performance share awards do not have the voting
    rights of common stock and the shares underlying the awards are
    not considered issued and outstanding. The Company expenses the
    cost of RSUs, which is determined to be the fair market value of
    the shares of the Company’s common stock at the date of
    grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions
    lapse. The Company estimated stock compensation expense for its
    performance share awards based on the vesting criteria and only
    recognized expense for the portions of such awards for which
    annual targets have been set. The Company accrued stock
    compensation expense of $2.2 million in operating expenses
    for 2008 in connection with its performance share awards. In
    addition to RSUs and performance share awards, during 2008, the
    Company also granted employee stock options covering
    15.7 million shares of common stock under the 2006 Plan.

Extension
    of Stock Option Exercise Periods for Former Employees

The Company could not issue any securities under its
    registration statements on

Form S-8

during the period in which it was not current in its SEC
    reporting obligations to file periodic reports under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, during parts of
    2006 and 2007, options vested and held by certain former
    employees of the Company could not be exercised until the
    completion of the Company’s stock option investigation and
    the Company’s public filings obligations had been met (the
    “trading black-out period”). The Company extended the
    expiration date of these stock options to April 7, 2007,
    the end of a

30-day

period subsequent to the Company’s filing of its required
    regulatory reports. As a result of the extensions, the fair
    values of such stock options had been reclassified to current
    liabilities subsequent to the modification and were subject to
    mark-to-market provisions at the end of each reporting period
    until the earlier of final settlement or April 7, 2007.
    Stock options covering approximately 660,000 shares of
    common stock were scheduled to expire and could not be exercised
    as a result of the trading black-out period restriction during
    the first quarter of 2007. The Company measured the fair value
    of these stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
    valuation model and recorded an expense of approximately
    $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2007. In addition, the
    Company recorded an expense of $4.4 million in the first
    quarter of 2007 associated with the approximately
    1,446,000 shares covered by such options which had exercise
    periods extended in 2006 as a result of the trading black-out
    period restriction. As of December 31, 2007, all of these
    extended stock options were either exercised or expired
    un-exercised. All previously recorded liabilities associated
    with such extensions were reclassified to additional paid-in
    capital by the second quarter of 2007.

Amendment
    of Certain Stock Options

In 2007, the Company completed a tender offer to amend certain
    options granted under the 1996 Plan and the 2000 Plan that had
    original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair
    market value per share of the common stock underlying the option
    on the option’s grant date, as determined by the Company
    for financial accounting purposes. Under this tender offer,
    employees subject to taxation in the United States and Canada
    had the opportunity to increase their strike price on affected
    options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the
    date of grant so as to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under
    United States Internal Revenue Code Section 409A
    (“409A issue”) or Canadian tax laws and regulations.
    In exchange for increasing the strike price of these options,
    the Company committed to make a cash payment to employees
    participating in the offer so as to make employees whole for the
    incremental strike price as compared to their original option
    exercise price. In connection with this offer, the Company
    amended options to purchase 4.3 million shares of its
    common stock and committed to make aggregate cash payments of
    $7.6 million to offer participants and recorded such amount
    as operating expense in 2007.

In addition, the Company entered into a separate agreement with
    two executives in 2007 to amend their unexercised stock options
    covering 0.1 million shares of the Company’s common
    stock in order to cure the 409A issue associated with such stock
    options. As a result, the Company committed to make aggregate
    cash payments of $0.4 million and recorded this payment
    liability as operating expense in 2007.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In April 1999, the Board approved the adoption of Juniper
    Networks 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999
    Purchase Plan”). The 1999 Purchase Plan permits eligible
    employees to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock
    through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10% of base
    compensation. Each employee may purchase no more than
    6,000 shares in any twelve-month period, and in no event,
    may an employee purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
    determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time
    such option is granted, in one calendar year. The 1999 Purchase
    Plan is implemented in a series of offering periods, each six
    months in duration, or a shorter period as determined by the
    Board. The price at which the common stock may be purchased is
    85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company’s
    common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period
    or on the last day of the applicable offering period. As a
    result of the Company’s failure to file its Quarterly
    Reports on

Form 10-Q

for the second and third quarters of 2006, the Company had
    suspended its employee payroll

withholdings for the purchase of its common stock under the 1999
    Purchase Plan from August 2006 through March 2007. In
    January 2007, the Board approved a delay of the start of the
    next offering period from February 1, 2007 to April 1,
    2007. Such offering period ended on July 31, 2007.

Compensation expense related to the common stock issued under
    the 1999 Purchase Plan was $13.2 million, $7.6 million
    and $6.6 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Employees purchased approximately 1.6 million,
    0.6 million, and 1.7 million shares of common stock
    through the 1999 Purchase Plan at an average exercise price of
    $22.57, $17.08 and $13.06 per share during fiscal years 2008,
    2007, and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2008,
    approximately 8.1 million shares had been issued since
    inception, and 12.3 million shares remained available for
    future issuance under the 1999 Purchase Plan. The 1999 Purchase
    Plan was discontinued effective February 1, 2009. As of
    December 31, 2007, approximately 7.1 million shares
    had been issued and 10.9 million shares remained available
    for future issuance under the 1999 Purchase Plan.

In May 2008, the Company’s stockholders approved the
    adoption of the Juniper Networks 2008 Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan (the “2008 Purchase Plan”). The 2008 Purchase
    Plan replaced the 1999 Purchase Plan, which was terminated
    immediately following the conclusion of the offering period
    ended January 30, 2009. The Board has reserved an aggregate
    of 12,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for
    issuance under the 2008 Purchase Plan. The 2008 Purchase Plan is
    generally similar to the 1999 Purchase Plan, except that under
    the 2008 Purchase Plan any increases to the number of shares
    reserved for issuance must be approved by the Company’s
    stockholders. The first offering period of the 2008 Purchase
    Plan commenced on the first trading day on or after
    February 1, 2009.

Common
    Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had reserved an
    aggregate of approximately 121.2 million shares of common
    stock for future issuance under all of its stock option plans
    and the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Valuation
    of Stock-Based Compensation

SFAS 123R requires the use of a valuation technique, such
    as an option-pricing model, to calculate the fair value of
    stock-based awards. The Company has elected to use the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which incorporates
    various assumptions including volatility, expected life,
    dividend, and risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility
    is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on
    the Company’s common stock, adjusted for other relevant
    factors including historical volatility of the Company’s
    common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the
    estimated expected life of the Company’s stock options. The
    expected life of an award is based on historical experience and
    on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to
    employees, as well as the potential effect from options that had
    not been exercised at the time.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Since 2006, the Company began granting stock option awards that
    have a contractual life of seven years from the date of grant.
    Prior to 2006, stock option awards generally had a ten-year
    contractual life from the date of grant.

In 2007, the government of India implemented a new fringe
    benefit tax that applies to equity awards granted to India
    taxpayers. This fringe benefit tax is payable by the issuer of
    the equity awards; however, the issuer is allowed to recover
    from individual award holders the fringe benefit taxes the
    issuer paid on their applicable equity awards. Beginning in
    January 2008, the Company amended its equity award agreements
    for future stock-based awards made to its employees in India to
    provide for the Company to be reimbursed for fringe benefit
    taxes paid in relation to applicable equity awards. The Company
    has elected to use a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
    that incorporates a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the fair
    value of stock-based awards issued under the amended equity
    award agreements. The assumptions used and the resulting
    estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options
    granted and for employee stock purchases under the ESPP during
    those periods are summarized as follows:

    there was only one purchase period in each of those years due to
    the temporary suspension of the ESPP between August 2006 and
    March 2007.

401(k)
    Plan

Juniper Networks maintains a savings and retirement plan
    qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
    of 1986, as amended. Employees meeting the eligibility
    requirement, as defined, may contribute up to the statutory
    limits of the year. The Company has matched employee
    contributions since January 1, 2001. Effective
    January 1, 2007, the Company matches 25% of all eligible
    employee contributions up to an annual maximum of $3,750. All
    matching contributions vest immediately. The Company’s
    matching contributions to the plan totaled $10.7 million,
    $9.5 million, and $5.8 million in 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan

In July 2008, the Company formed a non-qualified compensation
    plan (“NQDC”), which is an unfunded and unsecured
    deferred compensation arrangement. Under the NQDC, officers and
    other senior employees may elect to defer a portion of their
    compensation and contribute such amounts to one or more
    investment funds. The plan assets are included within
    investments and offsetting obligations are included within
    accrued compensation on the consolidated balance sheet. The
    investments are considered trading securities and are reported
    at fair value. The realized and unrealized holding gains and
    losses related to these investments, as well as the offsetting
    compensation

expense are recorded in the results of operations. The deferred
    compensation liability under this plan was approximately
    $1.0 million as of December 31, 2008.

Note 11.

Segment
    Information

The Company’s chief operating decision maker
    (“CODM”) allocates resources and assesses performance
    based on financial information by the Company’s business
    groups. In 2008, the Company realigned its organizational
    structure to include its Service business as a component of the
    related Infrastructure or SLT business groups. Accordingly, the
    previously reported Service segment has been combined into the
    Company’s two reportable segments as follows:
    Infrastructure and SLT. The Infrastructure segment includes
    products from the E-, M-, MX-, and T-series router product
    families, EX-series switching products, as well as the
    circuit-to-packet products. The SLT segment consists primarily
    of Firewall virtual private network (“Firewall”)
    systems and appliances, SSL VPN appliances, intrusion detection
    and prevention appliances (“IDP”), the J-series router
    product family and wide area network (“WAN”)
    optimization platforms.

The primary financial measure used by the CODM in assessing
    performance of the segments is segment operating income, which
    includes certain cost of revenues, research and development
    expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and
    administrative expenses. In 2008, the CODM did not allocate
    certain miscellaneous expenses to its segments even though such
    expenses were included in the Company’s management
    operating income.

For arrangements with both Infrastructure and SLT products and
    services, revenue is attributed to the segment based on the
    underlying purchase order, contract or sell-through report.
    Direct costs and operating expenses, such as standard costs,
    research and development expenses, and product marketing
    expenses, are generally applied to each segment. Indirect costs,
    such as manufacturing overhead and other cost of revenues, are
    allocated based on standard costs. Indirect operating expenses,
    such as sales, marketing, business development, and general and
    administrative expenses are generally allocated to each segment
    based on factors including headcount, usage, and revenue. The
    CODM does not allocate stock-based compensation, amortization of
    purchased intangible assets, impairment, gain or loss on equity
    investments, interest income and expense, other income and
    expense, income taxes, as well as certain other charges to the
    segments.

Further changes to this organizational structure may result in
    changes to the segments disclosed. The Company has restated the
    previously reported segment revenues and segment operating
    results to reflect the changes in its segments. Financial
    information for each segment used by the CODM is summarized as

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the
    Company’s total net revenues for 2008. Nokia-Siemens
    Networks B.V. (“NSN”) and its predecessor companies
    accounted for 12.8%, and 14.3% of the Company’s net
    revenues for 2007, and 2006, respectively. The revenue
    attributed to this significant customer was derived from the
    sale of products and services in both the Infrastructure and SLT
    segments.

As of December 31, 2008, and 2007, the Company had a
    valuation allowance on its U.S. domestic deferred tax
    assets of approximately $41.5 million and
    $34.3 million, respectively, which relates to capital
    losses that will carry forward to offset future capital gains.
    The valuation allowance increased $7.2 million and
    decreased $4.4 million in the years ended December 31,
    2008, and 2007, respectively. The 2008 increase was attributable
    primarily to investment losses currently disallowed for income
    tax purposes. The 2007 reduction was attributable primarily to
    the reversal of investment losses previously disallowed for
    income tax purposes.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had Federal and
    California net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $20.3 million and $21.2 million, respectively. The
    Company also had Federal and California tax credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $11.9 million and
    $100.7 million, respectively. The benefits of approximately
    $11.9 million of the Federal tax credit carry-forwards and
    $12.3 million of the California tax credit carry-forwards
    will be credited to additional paid in capital when utilized on
    the Company’s income tax returns since they have not met
    the utilization criteria of SFAS 123R. Unused net operating
    loss carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in
    the year 2012. The Federal tax credits will expire in 2029, and
    the California tax credit carry-forwards will carry forward
    indefinitely.

The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are
    considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
    The Company has made no provision for U.S. income taxes on
    approximately $705.2 million of cumulative undistributed
    earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through
    December 31, 2008, because it is the Company’s
    intention to permanently reinvest such earnings. If such
    earnings were distributed, the Company would accrue additional
    income taxes expense of

approximately $214.3 million. These earnings are considered
    indefinitely invested in operations outside of the U.S., as we
    intend to utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of our
    international operations.

As of December 31, 2008, and 2007, the total amount of
    gross unrecognized tax benefits was $113.5 million and
    $94.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008,
    approximately $97.7 million of the $113.5 million
    gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the
    effective tax rate.

As of December 31, 2008, and 2007, the Company had accrued
    interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $8.7 million and $5.9 million,
    respectively, within other long-term liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with the
    Company’s accounting policy, accrued interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a
    component of tax expense in the consolidated statements of
    operations. The Company recognized net interest expense of
    $2.9 million and $1.7 million in its consolidated
    statements of operations during the years ending
    December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

The Company engages in continuous discussion and negotiation
    with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various
    jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that the
    amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change
    within the next 12 months. The Company does not expect
    complete resolution of any IRS audits or other audits within
    significant foreign or state jurisdictions within the next
    12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that certain
    issues related to the Company’s business credits and
    foreign audits may be resolved in the next 12 months.
    Accordingly, the Company believes that its existing unrecognized
    tax benefits may be reduced by approximately $13.0 million
    in the next 12 months.

The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, Juniper
    Networks or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax
    returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state
    and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business the
    Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities
    throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as
    Ireland, Hong Kong, U.K., France, Germany, The Netherlands,
    Japan, China, Australia, India, and the U.S. With few
    exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to
    U.S. federal, state and local, or

non-U.S. income

tax examinations for years before 2003, although carry-forward
    attributes that were generated prior to 2003 may still be
    adjusted upon examination by the IRS if the attributes either
    have been or will be used in a future period.

The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the
    2004 tax year, the Indian tax authorities for the 2004 tax year,
    and the German tax authorities for the 2005 tax year.
    Additionally, the Company has not reached a final resolution
    with the IRS on an adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000
    tax years. The Company was not under examination by any other
    major jurisdictions in which the Company files its income tax
    returns as of December 31, 2008.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In September 2008, as part of the on-going 2004 IRS audit, the
    Company received a proposed adjustment related to our business
    credit carry-forwards, which if agreed, would reduce our
    business credit carry-forwards. In December 2008, the Company
    received a proposed adjustment from the Indian tax authorities
    related to the 2004 tax year. The Company is pursuing all
    available administrative procedures relative to these matters.
    In December 2008, the Company reached a tentative settlement
    with the German tax authorities for the 2005 tax year. The
    Company believes that we have adequately provided for any
    reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these proposed
    adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these matters is
    unlikely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    condition or results of operations.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting:

Please see
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting under Item 8 on page 61 of this

Form 10-K,

which report is incorporated herein by reference.

(b) For the “Report of Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm,” please see the report under Item 8
    on page 64 of this

Form 10-K,

which report is incorporated herein by reference.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
    which are required in accordance with

Rule 13a-14

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”). This “Controls and
    Procedures” section includes information concerning the
    controls and related evaluations referred to in the
    certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the
    certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics
    presented.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer
    concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this
    report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
    reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
    periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules
    and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

In 2007, we initiated a multi-year implementation to upgrade
    certain key internal systems and processes, including our
    company-wide human resources management system, customer
    relationship management (“CRM”) system, and our
    enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This
    project is the result of our normal business process to evaluate
    and upgrade or replace our systems software and related business
    processes to support our evolving operational needs. There were
    no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
    occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),
    does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal
    control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
    error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
    will be met. Our controls and procedures are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that our control system’s objective
    will be met and our CEO and CFO have concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level. The design of a control system must
    reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
    benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
    Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
    systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not
    occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
    within the company have been detected. These inherent
    limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
    circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
    part on certain assumptions



about the likelihood of future events. Projections of any
    evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods
    are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree
    of compliance with policies or procedures.
