PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

We design, develop and sell products and services that together
    provide our customers with high-performance network
    infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments
    for accelerating the deployment of services and applications
    over a single Internet Protocol (“IP”)-based network.
    We serve the high-performance networking requirements of global
    service providers, enterprises, governments and research and
    education institutions that view the network as critical to
    their success. High-performance networking is designed to
    provide fast, reliable and secure access to applications and
    services. We offer a high-performance network infrastructure
    that includes

best-in-class IP

routing, Ethernet switching security and application
    acceleration solutions, as well as partnerships designed to
    extend the value of the network and worldwide services and
    support designed to optimize customer investments.

In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, we experienced
    growth in both product and service revenues. We also generated
    strong net income, operating margin, and cash flows from
    operations during 2007. We believe these results were driven by
    market demands and our focused execution of our two fundamental
    objectives: To establish our growth and momentum in the
    high-performance networking marketplace as reflected by top line
    performance, and to improve our leverage against those revenues,
    as demonstrated by the bottom line improvements in our financial
    results.

Our operations are organized into three reportable segments:
    Infrastructure, Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”),
    and Service. Our Infrastructure segment primarily offers
    scalable routing products that are used to control and direct
    network traffic from the core, through the edge, aggregation and
    the customer premise equipment level. Infrastructure products
    include our IP routing and carrier Ethernet routing portfolio,
    as well as our recently announced Ethernet switching portfolio.
    Our SLT segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our
    customer’s priorities, from protecting the network itself,
    and protecting data on the network, to maximizing existing
    bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed
    network. SLT products include firewall and virtual private
    network (“VPN”) systems and appliances, secure sockets
    layer virtual private network (“SSL”) appliances,
    intrusion detection and prevention (“IDP”) appliances,
    application front end platforms, the J-series router product
    family, integrated Secure Services Gateway (“SSG”)
    secure router product offerings and wide area network
    (“WAN”) optimization platforms. Together, our
    high-performance network infrastructure offerings help enable
    our customers to convert legacy networks that provide
    commoditized, best efforts services into more valuable assets
    that provide differentiation and value and increased
    performance, reliability and security to end users. Our Service
    segment delivers world-wide services to customers of the
    Infrastructure and SLT segments.

During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 we generated
    net revenues of $2.8 billion and conducted business in more
    than 100 countries around the world. See Item 8 of
    Part II for more information on our consolidated financial
    position as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and our
    consolidated results of operations, consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ equity, and consolidated statements of cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007.

We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in
    Delaware in 1998. Our corporate headquarters are located in
    Sunnyvale, California. Our website address is www.juniper.net.

Our
    Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of
    high-performance networking. We offer a high-performance network
    infrastructure that creates a responsive and trusted environment
    for accelerating the deployment of services and applications
    over a single

IP-based

network. We believe our open network infrastructure provides
    customers with greater choice and control in quickly meeting
    high-performance business requirements, while enabling them to
    reduce costs. Our strategy is designed to advance the
    fundamentals and economics of high-performance networking. Key
    elements of our strategy are described below.



Maintain
    and Extend Technology Leadership

Our application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”)
    technology, JUNOS operating system and network-optimized product
    architecture have been key elements to establishing and
    maintaining our technology leadership. We believe that these
    elements can be leveraged into future products that we are
    currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our
    technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise
    markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in
    our research and development departments, supplemented by
    external partnerships, including strategic alliances, as well as
    acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broader range of
    products and services to customers in target markets.

Leverage
    Position as Supplier of High-Performance Network
    Infrastructure

From inception we have focused on designing, developing and
    building high-performance network infrastructure for demanding
    service provider and enterprise networking environments and have
    integrated purpose-built technology into a network optimized
    architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs.
    We believe that many of these customers will deploy networking
    equipment from only a few vendors. We believe that the
    performance, reliability and security of our products provide us
    with a competitive advantage, which is critical in gaining
    selection as one of these vendors.

Be
    Strategic to Our Customers

In developing our infrastructure and SLT solutions, we work very
    closely with customers to design and build

best-in-class

products specifically designed to meet their complex needs. Over
    time, we have expanded our understanding of the escalating
    demands and risks facing our customers. That increased
    understanding has enabled us to subsequently design additional
    capabilities into our products. We believe our close
    relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers
    have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments
    to date. We plan to continue to work

hand-in-hand

with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as
    to design future products that meet the evolving needs of the
    marketplace, while enabling customers to reduce costs.

Enable
    New

IP-Based

Services

Our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and
    secure networks cost-effectively and deploy new differentiated
    services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than
    legacy network products. We believe that the secure delivery of

IP-based

services and applications, including IP Television
    (“IPTV”), web hosting, outsourced Internet and
    intranet services, outsourced enterprise applications and
    voice-over IP, will continue to grow and are cost-effectively
    enabled by our high-performance network infrastructure offerings.

Establish
    and Develop Industry Partnerships

Our customers have diverse requirements. While our products meet
    certain requirements of our customers, our products are not
    intended to satisfy certain other requirements. Therefore, we
    believe that it is important that we attract and build
    relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of
    technologies and services that extend the value of the network
    for our customers. These partnerships ensure that we have access
    to those technologies and services, whether through technology
    integration, joint development, resale or other collaboration,
    in order to better support a broader set of our customers’
    requirements. In addition, we believe in an open network
    infrastructure that invites partner innovation and provides
    customers with greater choice and control in meeting their
    evolving business requirements, while enabling them to reduce
    costs.



Markets
    and Customers

We sell our high-performance network products and service
    offerings through direct sales and through distributors and
    value-added resellers to end-users in the following markets:

Service
    Providers

Service providers include wireline, wireless, and cable
    operators as well as major internet content and application
    providers. Supporting most major service provider networks in
    the world, our high-performance network infrastructure offerings
    are designed and built for the performance, reliability and
    security that service providers demand. Our networking
    infrastructure offerings benefit these customers by:

•

Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple
    services over the same network using our high density, highly
    reliable platforms;

•

Promoting generation of additional revenue by enabling new
    services to be offered to new market segments based on our
    product capabilities;

•

Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by
    enabling consumers to self-select automatically provisioned
    service packages that provide the quality, speed and pricing
    they desire; and

•

Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on
    investment as their networks can scale to multi-terabit rates
    based on the capabilities of our platforms.

While many of these service providers have historically been
    categorized separately as wireline, wireless, or cable
    operators, in recent years we have seen a move towards
    convergence of these different types of service providers
    through acquisitions, mergers and partnerships. We believe these
    strategic developments are made technically possible as
    operators invest in the build out of next generation networks
    (“NGN”) capable of supporting voice, video and data
    traffic on to the same

IP-based

network. This convergence relies on

IP-based

traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multi-service
    networks including new service offerings such as IPTV. These new
    services offer service providers significant new revenue
    opportunities.

We believe that there are several other trends affecting service
    providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products
    and solutions. These trends include significant growth in IP
    traffic on service provider networks as a result of

peer-to-peer

interaction, broadband usage, video, and an increasing reliance
    on the network as a mission critical business tool in the
    strategies of our IP customers, and of their enterprise
    customers.

The IP infrastructure market for service providers includes:
    products and technology at the network core; the network edge to
    enable access; the aggregation layer; security to protect from
    the inside out and the outside in; the application awareness and
    intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user
    needs; and the management, service awareness and control of the
    entire infrastructure.

We have sold our products to all of the 65 largest service
    providers in the world.

Enterprise

Our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are
    designed to meet the performance, reliability and security
    requirements of the world’s most demanding businesses. For
    this reason, enterprises, federal, state and local governments,
    and research and education institutions that view their networks
    as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as
    a powerful component in delivering the advanced network
    capabilities needed for their leading-edge applications while:

•

Assisting in the consolidation and delivery of existing services
    and applications;

•

Accelerating the deployment of new services and applications;

•

Offering integrated security to assist in the protection and
    recovery of services and applications; and

•

Offering operational improvements that enable cost reductions,
    including lower administrative, training, customer care and
    labor costs.



The enterprise market continued to be an important part of our
    business growth during 2007, driven in particular by growth in
    the second half of the year. Since we first entered the market,
    we have sold our products to more than 30,000 enterprise
    customers.

As with the service provider market, innovation continues to be
    a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market.
    We believe that innovative enterprises view the network as
    critical to their success and therefore must build advanced
    network infrastructures that provide fast, reliable and secure
    access to services and applications over a single IP-based
    network. These high-performance enterprises require networks
    that are global, distributed and always available. Network
    equipment vendors need to demonstrate performance, reliability
    and security to these customers in specific segments with

best-in-class

open solutions for maximum flexibility. We offer enterprise
    solutions and services for data centers, branch and campus
    applications, distributed and extended enterprises, and WAN
    gateways.

As customers increasingly view the network as critical to their
    success, we believe that customers will increasingly demand
    fast, reliable and secure access to services and applications
    over a single

IP-based

network. This is partly illustrated by the increasing success of
    our Integrated Security Gateway (“ISG”) products that
    combine firewall/VPN and IDP solutions in a single platform and
    SSG platforms that provide a mix of high-performance security
    with Local Area Network (“LAN”)/WAN connectivity for
    regional and branch office deployments. We will continue to
    invest to develop these and other converged technologies and
    solutions.

Fundamental
    Requirements for High Performance Networking

Our service provider customers have clearly communicated their
    fundamental business requirement to quickly and cost-effectively
    deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of
    revenue.

Our enterprise customers are under pressure to accelerate the
    delivery of service-enabling applications to build
    differentiation and sustainable growth.

In parallel, both service providers and enterprises must focus
    on proactively detecting and preventing the ever increasing
    number of security threats facing the network itself and the
    data that flows across the network. This security must be innate
    to networking products and must not come at the expense of
    overall performance or unjustifiable cost.

This is driving the fundamental requirement for high-performance
    networking, providing fast, reliable and secure access to
    applications and services over a single

IP-based

network. Feature richness, high reliability, security, high
    performance, scalability, and cost effectiveness are each
    fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with
    the growth in IP traffic and the delivery of value-added
    services to end users.

Feature Richness.

The importance of increasing
    revenue streams and decreasing capital and operational costs for
    our customers is a significant priority in the industry. Service
    providers want to quickly and cost effectively deploy new
    differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue.
    Enterprises and other network operators want to accelerate the
    delivery of service-enabling applications to build
    differentiation and growth. Each of these goals is ultimately a
    function of the features and capabilities that can be securely
    provided on each of the network elements. As networks advance,
    more and more features are required to sell new services as well
    as to lower the ongoing costs of operating the network. Next
    generation networking solutions therefore need to have
    flexibility to add new capabilities frequently without
    compromising the performance of the system, which gets
    increasingly difficult as the network demands increase.

High Reliability.

As businesses and consumers
    increasingly rely on IP networks for mission-critical
    applications, high network reliability is critical to success.
    As a result, those businesses and consumers expect service
    providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their
    networks.

Security.

Today’s network environment
    presents an ever-increasing number of challenges regarding
    network security ranging from simple denial of service attacks
    to sophisticated, pervasive and malicious intrusions. The
    importance of security is increasing within all of our customers
    and we are continually improving and evolving the security
    capabilities on all of our product solutions. It is extremely
    important to provide comprehensive network-



based security services that are fully integrated, free of
    performance trade-offs, and scaleable to any customer or market.

High-Performance Without Compromising
    Intelligence.

To handle the rapid growth in IP
    traffic, today’s customers increasingly require fast,
    reliable and secure networking solutions that can operate at
    higher speeds, while still delivering real-time services such as
    security and

quality-of-service

features. The processing of data packets at these high speeds
    requires sophisticated forwarding technology to inspect each
    packet and assign it to a destination based on priority, data
    type and other considerations. Because a large number of IP
    packets, many of which perform critical administrative
    functions, are small in size, high-performance IP routers need
    to achieve their specified transmission speeds even for small
    packet sizes. Because smaller packets increase packet processing
    demands, routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be
    more resource intensive than routing of larger packets. A wire
    speed router, which achieves its specified transmission rate for
    any type of traffic passing through it, can accomplish this
    task. Thus, provisioning of mission-critical services
    increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed
    processing.

High-Performance Under Stressful
    Conditions.

In a large and complex network,
    individual components inevitably fail. However, the failure of
    an individual device or link must not compromise the network as
    a whole. In a typical network, when a failure occurs, the
    network loses some degree of capacity and, in turn, a greater
    load falls on the remaining network routers, which must provide
    alternate routes. High-performance network infrastructure must
    quickly adapt to the new state of the network to maintain packet
    forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of
    packets when active routes are lost or when large numbers of
    routes change. Routing protocols are used to accomplish this
    convergence, a process that places even greater stress on the
    router. Given the complexity of IP network infrastructure, the
    convergence process is complex and places a far greater load on
    the router, thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device.

Scalability.

Due to the rapid growth in IP
    traffic, service providers must continuously expand their
    networks, both in terms of increased numbers of access points of
    presence (“PoPs”), and also greater capacity per PoP.
    To facilitate this expansion process, secure networking
    solutions must be highly scalable. Next generation network
    appliances therefore need to be flexible and configurable to
    function within constantly changing networks while incurring
    minimal downtime.

High Return on Investment.

Continued growth in
    IP traffic, price competition in the telecommunications market
    and increasing pressure for network operators to attain higher
    returns on their network infrastructure investments all
    contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that
    significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build
    and operate their networks. In addition to the basic cost of
    equipment, network operators incur substantial ancillary costs
    for the space required to deploy the equipment, power consumed
    and ongoing operation and maintenance of the equipment. Network
    operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment
    configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor space, with
    increasing consideration to energy and cooling requirements and
    costs. Therefore, in order to continue to scale their networks
    toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner, network
    operators need the ability to mix and match easily many
    different speed connections at appropriate densities, without
    significantly increasing the consumption of space or power and
    driving costs higher.

These requirements define a clear need for high-performance
    networking solutions that have been designed to support high
    speeds and offer new

IP-based

services. At the same time, network operators are eagerly
    seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and
    reliability within their networks, while reducing the cost and
    complexity of their architectures.

Our
    Technology and Products

Early in our history, we developed, marketed and sold the first
    commercially available purpose-built IP backbone router
    optimized for the specific high-performance requirements of
    service providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to
    increase, the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the
    network was created. Our infrastructure products are designed to
    address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as
    well as for wireless access by combining high-performance packet
    forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a
    network-optimized solution. In addition, as enterprises continue
    to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive
    internal networks, we believe the need for products with
    high-performance routing technology is



expanding to a broader set of customers, and we believe our
    expertise in this technology uniquely positions us to address
    this growing market opportunity.

Additionally, we offer a broad family of network security
    solutions that deliver high-performance, cost-effective security
    for enterprises, service providers and government entities,
    including firewall and VPN systems and appliances, SSL
    appliances, and IDP appliances. With the 2005 acquisitions of
    Funk Software, Inc. (“Funk”), Peribit Networks, Inc.
    (“Peribit”), Redline Networks, Inc.
    (“Redline”), and Kagoor Networks, Inc.
    (“Kagoor”), we added complementary products and
    technologies to our product families that enable our customers
    to provide additional

IP-based

services and enhance the performance and security of their
    existing networks and applications.

Infrastructure
    Products

We believe that an overview of the physical nature of our
    infrastructure products is helpful in understanding the
    operation of our business.

Although specific designs vary among our product families, our
    router platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis
    serving as the base of the platform. The chassis contains
    components that enable and support many of the fundamental
    functions of the router, such as power supplies, cooling fans,
    and components that run the operating system, perform high-speed
    packet forwarding, or keep track of the structure of the network
    and instruct the packet forwarding components where to send
    packets. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are
    available to be populated with components we refer to as modules
    or interfaces.

The modules are the components through which the router receives
    incoming packets of data from the network over a variety of
    transmission media. The physical connection between a
    transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The
    number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the
    functionality and throughput offered by the module. In some
    cases, modules do not contain ports or physically receive
    packets from the network, but rather provide additional
    capabilities or features that enhance the overall functionality
    of the router. We refer to these components as service modules.

Our new EX-Series family of Ethernet switches include
    Virtual Chassis and fixed configuration design elements. Virtual
    Chassis technology allows up to ten switches to be
    interconnected and operate as a single system, thereby enabling
    higher port density in a compact and efficient form factor. Our
    fixed configuration switch platforms offer a cost-effective
    standalone solution for low-density deployments.

Major infrastructure product families are summarized as follows:

•

    existing networks and applications.

Major SLT product families are summarized as follows:

•

Firewall and VPN Systems:

Our NS-5400, -5200,
    and -500 products and ISG-2000 and -1000 products are
    high-performance security systems designed to provide integrated
    firewall, VPN and denial of service protection capabilities for
    enterprise environments and service provider network
    infrastructures. Our

ISG-2000

and
    -1000 products can also deliver intrusion detection and
    prevention functionality with the addition of optional security
    modules to the base ISG chassis. Each of our firewall and VPN
    systems can be deployed in high bandwidth environments and can
    be used to deliver managed security services. Our firewall and
    VPN systems allow unique security policies to be enforced for
    multiple virtual local area networks, or Virtual LANs
    (“VLANs”), allowing a single system to secure multiple
    networks. Our security systems also allow for the creation of
    multiple Virtual Systems, each providing a unique security
    domain with its own virtual firewall and VPN and dedicated
    management interface. These features enable enterprises, service
    providers and government entities to use a single security
    system to secure multiple networks and enable carriers to
    deliver security services to multiple customers.

•

Firewall and VPN Appliances:

Our SSG family of
    secure routing products represents a new class of purpose-built
    security appliance that delivers a mix of high performance,
    security and LAN/WAN connectivity for regional and branch office
    deployments. The SSG appliances combine proven firewall/VPN and
    robust routing with a set of Unified Threat Management
    (“UTM”) security features to protect traffic as it
    flows in and out of the branch office. Our NS-208, -204, -100,
    -50, -25, -5XT and -5XP security appliances are fixed
    configuration products of varying performance characteristics
    that offer integrated firewall, VPN and denial of service
    protection capabilities. Our security appliances are designed to
    maximize security and performance while using less physical
    space than competing products. Our security appliances can be
    deployed to provide small to medium-sized businesses and
    enterprise remote locations with secure Internet access and
    communication.

•

SSL VPN Appliances:

Our Secure Access-6000,
    -4000, -2000, and -700 appliances are used to secure remote
    access for mobile employees, secure extranets for customers and
    partners, and secure intranets. Our SSL VPN appliances are
    designed to be used in enterprise environments of all sizes.

•

IDP Appliances:

Our IDP-1100, -600, -200 and
    -50 appliances utilize intrusion detection methods to increase
    the attack detection accuracy and provide the broadest attack
    detection coverage available. Our IDP appliances provide fast
    and efficient traffic processing and alarm collection,
    presentation and forwarding. Once an attack is detected, our IDP
    appliances prevent the intrusion by dropping the packets or
    connection associated with the attack, reducing or eliminating
    the effects of the attack. Our IDP appliances can also alert the
    IT staff to respond to the attack. Our IDP appliances can be
    clustered to provide high availability and reduce risk
    associated with a single point of failure.

•

Application Acceleration Platforms:

Our WX and
    WXC products improve the performance of

client-server

and web-enabled business applications for branch-office, remote,
    and mobile users. These application acceleration platforms
    enable our customers to deliver LAN-like performance to users
    around the globe who access centralized applications.

•

Unified Access Control (“UAC”)
    Solution:

Using our UAC 2.1 solution, our IC-4000
    and -6000 appliances combine identity-based policy and end-point
    intelligence to give enterprises real-time visibility and policy
    control throughout the network.



•

AAA and 802.1X Products:

Our family of AAA and
    802.1X network access security products, including our Odyssey
    Access Client and Steel Belted Radius products, are a key
    component to uniform security policy enforcement across all
    network access methods, including wireless LAN, remote/VPN,
    dial, and identity-based (wired 802.1X) methods.

In 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, we announced several
    significant new products in our Infrastructure and SLT product
    categories including, but not limited to, the following:

Infrastructure:

•

Our portfolio of Session and Resource Control solutions, which
    provide subscriber management and policy control capabilities,
    enabling service providers to deliver a high-quality user
    experience for

“multi-play”

and mobile services in next-generation networks. The Session and
    Resource Control portfolio features modular software
    applications that build upon the feature set of our SDX-300
    Service Deployment System, and the new C-series family of
    controllers which support

end-to-end

policy management on a dedicated,

purpose-built

platform.

•

The newest member of the T-series family, the T1600 core router.
    Capable of delivering 1.6 Tbps of throughput in a single
    half-rack chassis, the T1600 core router is designed to ease the
    transition to

next-generation

networks and enable service providers to efficiently accelerate
    the deployment of the services demanded by their customers.

•

The E120 broadband services router, a platform capable of
    delivering up to 120 Gbps of capacity in a compact chassis with
    support for up to 64,000 individual subscribers. This router
    enables service providers to efficiently generate incremental
    revenue and shares the same proven JUNOSe operating system, line
    cards and interface modules as the widely-deployed E320 router.

•

An expansion of our MX-Series family of Ethernet Services
    Routers with the additions of the MX480 and MX240. Designed to
    address emerging Ethernet network architectures and services,
    each platform scales to support over 1 million media access
    control (“MAC”) addresses which enables service
    providers to effectively scale Ethernet to support large service
    provider deployments.

•

The EX-series of Ethernet switches described above.

SLT:

•

ScreenOS version 6.0 operating system for the ISG and SSG
    platforms and version 4.1 software for our IDP products. These
    software releases provide our customers with advanced visibility
    and control of applications and users, enabling them to set and
    enforce security policies across the network and enhance
    application delivery and performance to improve user
    productivity and to keep pace with escalating business
    requirements.

•

The J2320 and J2350 J-series services routers, SSG 320M and SSG
    350M security platforms and two new network management
    appliances with NetScreen-Security Manager (“NSM”)
    Central Manager and NSMXpress. The new J-series, SSG and NSM
    products are designed to enable enterprises to accelerate the
    secure delivery of business critical applications across their
    networks.

•

Software enhancements to our SSL VPN appliances that provide
    support for a broader array of applications and platforms,
    enhanced access control, and policy enforcement capabilities
    designed to meet the requirements of high-performance businesses.

•

Version 2.1 of UAC solution, advancing our ability to address
    the evolving access control and security requirements of
    customers. UAC 2.1 helps reduce the complexity of securing
    access to networks and applications and delivers access control,
    visibility and monitoring of applications and users to help
    address regulatory compliance while mitigating risk and exposure
    to today’s rapidly evolving threat landscape.



•

New additions to our WX and WXC application acceleration
    platforms fortified application security without compromising
    performance and enhancements to the WX Central Management System
    allow for the integration of content distribution and WAN
    optimization within a single platform.

See Note 11 in Item 8 for a breakdown of net product
    revenues by segment.

Customer
    Service and Support

In addition to Infrastructure products and SLT products, we
    offer the following services: 24x7x365 technical assistance,
    hardware repair and replacement parts, unspecified software
    updates on a when and if available basis, professional services
    and educational services. We deliver these services directly to
    major end users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model,
    leveraging the capabilities of our partners and third-party
    organizations as appropriate.

We also train our channel partners in the delivery of education
    and support services to ensure locally delivered training.

As of December 31, 2007, we employed 748 people in our
    worldwide customer service and support organization. We believe
    that a broad range of support services is essential to the
    successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our
    products and we have hired support engineers with proven network
    experience to provide those services.

Manufacturing
    and Operations

As of December 31, 2007, we employed 190 people in
    manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships
    with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and
    monitor and manage product testing and quality.

We have manufacturing relationships primarily with Celestica,
    Flextronics and Plexus, under which we have subcontracted the
    majority of our manufacturing activity. Our manufacturing
    activity is primarily conducted in Canada, China and the United
    States.

This subcontracting activity in all locations extends from
    prototypes to full production and includes activities such as
    material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to
    our customers and repairs. Together with our contract
    manufacturers, we design, specify and monitor the tests that are
    required to meet internal and external quality standards. These
    arrangements provide us with the following benefits:

•

We can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey
    manufacturing and drop-shipment capabilities;

•

We gain economies of scale because, by purchasing large
    quantities of common components, our contract manufacturers
    obtain more favorable pricing than if we were buying components
    alone;

•

We operate without dedicating significant space to manufacturing
    operations; and

•

We can reduce our costs by reducing fixed overhead expenses.

Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on
    rolling forecasts from us about our product demands. Each of the
    contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble
    the products in our forecast and test the products according to
    our specifications. Products are then shipped to our
    distributors, value-added resellers or end-users. Generally, we
    do not own the components and title to the products transfers
    from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our
    customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If
    the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified
    periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete
    material charges for components that our contract manufacturers
    purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer
    orders.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers,
    those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the
    contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The
    contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a
    long-term basis.



Our ASICs are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources,
    such as IBM Corporation and Toshiba Corporation, each of whom is
    responsible for all aspects of the production of the ASICs using
    our proprietary designs.

Juniper Networks has at its core five key values: trust,
    integrity, respect, humility and excellence. These values are
    integral to how we manage our company and interact with our
    employees, customers, partners and suppliers. By working
    collaboratively with our suppliers, we also have the opportunity
    to promote socially responsible business practices beyond
    Juniper Networks and into our worldwide supply chain. To this
    end, we have adopted, and promote the adoption by others, of the
    Electronic Industry Code of Conduct. The Electronic Industry
    Code of Conduct outlines standards to ensure that working
    conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe,
    that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that
    manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.

Research
    and Development

As of December 31, 2007, we employed 2,563 people in
    our worldwide research and development organizations. Our
    research and development expenses totaled $623.0 million,
    $480.3 million and $357.3 million in the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We have
    assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience
    in the fields of high-end computing, network system design, ASIC
    design, security, routing protocols and embedded operating
    systems. These individuals have worked in leading computer data
    networking and telecommunications companies.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are
    essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology,
    developing additional applications, incorporating that
    technology and maintaining the competitiveness of our product
    and service offerings. In our infrastructure and SLT products,
    we are leveraging our ASIC technology, developing additional
    network interfaces targeted to our customer applications and
    continuing to develop next generation technology to support the
    anticipated growth in IP network requirements. We continue to
    expand the functionality of our products to improve performance
    reliability and scalability, and to provide an enhanced user
    interface.

Our research and development process is driven by the
    availability of new technology, market demand and customer
    feedback. We have invested significant time and resources in
    creating a structured process for all product development
    projects. Following an assessment of market demand, our research
    and development team develops a full set of comprehensive
    functional product specifications based on inputs from the
    product management and sales organizations. This process is
    designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the
    steps, tasks and activities required to bring product concepts
    and development projects to market.

Sales and
    Marketing

As of December 31, 2007, we employed 1,863 people in
    our worldwide sales and marketing organizations. These sales
    employees operate in different locations around the world in
    support of our customers.

Our sales organization is organized into three geographic
    regions and within each region according to the particular needs
    in that market. Our three geographic regions are (i) the
    Americas (including United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and
    South America), (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa and
    (iii) Asia Pacific. Within each region there are regional
    and country teams to ensure we operate close to the customer.

The sales teams operate in their respective regions and
    generally either engage customers directly or manage customer
    opportunities through our distribution and reseller
    relationships or channels as described below. In the United
    States and Canada, we sell to several service providers directly
    and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers
    primarily through resellers. Almost all of our sales outside the
    United States and Canada are made through our channel partners.

See Note 11 in Item 8 for information concerning our
    revenues by significant customers and by geographic region. Our
    operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties
    associated with international operations. See Item 1A of
    Part I, “Risk Factors” for more information.



Direct
    Sales Structure

Where we have a direct relationship with our customers, the
    terms and conditions are governed either by customer purchase
    orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase
    contracts. In instances where we have direct contracts with our
    customers, those contracts set forth only general terms of sale
    and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of
    our products. For this type of customer our sales team engages
    directly with the customer. Customer purchase orders are
    received, and processed directly, by Juniper Networks.

Channel
    Sales Structure

A critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our
    channel partners through which we do the majority of our
    business. We employ various channel partners:

•

A global network of strategic distribution relationships, as
    well as region or country-specific distributors who in turn sell
    to local value added resellers who sell to the end-user
    customer. The distribution channel partners mainly sell our SLT
    products plus some router products that are often purchased by
    our enterprise customers. These distributors tend to be focused
    on particular regions or particular countries within regions.
    For example, we have substantial distribution relationships with
    Ingram Micro in the Americas and with NEC in Japan. Our
    agreements with these distributors are generally non-exclusive,
    limited by region, and provide product discounts and other
    ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require our
    distributors to purchase specified quantities of our products.

•

Direct value-added resellers including our strategic resellers
    referenced below, which resell our products to end-users around
    the world. These direct value-added resellers buy the products
    and services directly from us and have expertise in deploying
    complex networking solutions in their respective markets. Our
    agreements with these direct value-added resellers are generally
    non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product discounts
    and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not
    require our direct value-added resellers to purchase specified
    quantities of our products.

•

Strategic world-wide reseller relationships with Nokia-Siemens
    Networks B.V. (“NSN”), Ericsson Telekom A.B. and
    Alcatel-Lucent. These companies each offer services and products
    that complement, but in some cases compete with, our own product
    offerings and act as a fulfillment partner for our products. Our
    arrangements with each of these partners allow them to resell
    our products on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for
    discounts based upon the volume of products sold and specify
    other general terms of sale. The agreements do not require these
    partners to purchase specified quantities of our products. NSN
    accounted for greater than 10% of our total net revenues in 2007.

Within each region we employ sales professionals to assist with
    the management of our various sales channels. In addition we
    have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly
    with the channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a
    direct relationship with our more strategic end user customers
    while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of
    product through our channel partners.

Our sales organization is generally split between service
    provider and enterprise customers, with each separate team
    ensuring focus on the key customers in these respective markets.
    There is a structure of sales professionals, system engineers,
    and marketing and channel teams each focused on the respective
    service provider and enterprise markets.

Backlog

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under
    framework agreements with our customers. At any given time, we
    have orders for products that have not been shipped and for
    services that have not yet been performed for various reasons.
    Because we believe industry practice would allow customers to
    cancel or change orders with limited advance notice prior to
    shipment or performance, as well as our history of allowing such
    changes and cancellations, we do not consider this backlog to be
    firm and do not believe our backlog information is necessarily
    indicative of future revenue.



Seasonality

Many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal
    fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the
    first and third quarters. In addition, our SLT segment has
    experienced seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth
    quarter. This historical pattern should not be considered a
    reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial
    performance.

Competition

Infrastructure
    Business

In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems has
    historically been the dominant player in the market. However,
    other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Extreme
    Networks, Inc., Foundry Networks, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co.,
    Ltd., and Nortel Networks Corporation, are providing competitive
    products in the marketplace.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco,
    Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and Nortel have significantly broader
    product lines than we do and may bundle their products with
    other networking products in a manner that may discourage
    customers from purchasing our products. In addition,
    consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition of our
    partners and resellers by competitors, can increase the
    competitive pressure faced by us. For example, in 2006 Alcatel
    combined with Lucent Technologies, Inc. and Ericsson acquired
    Redback Networks. Also, many of our current and potential
    competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive
    customer bases that could be leveraged. Increased competition
    could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced
    gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could
    seriously harm our operating results.

SLT
    Business

In the market for SLT products, Cisco generally is our primary
    competitor with its broad range of products. In addition, there
    are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines
    within SLT, including Checkpoint Software Technologies,
    Fortinet, Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., Nortel and Riverbed
    Technology, Inc. These additional competitors tend to be focused
    on single product line solutions and therefore are generally
    specialized and focused as competitors to our products. In
    addition, a number of public and private companies have
    announced plans for new products to address the same needs that
    our products address. We believe that our ability to compete
    with Cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate
    that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our
    current and potential customers.

For both product groups we expect that, over time, large
    companies with significant resources, technical expertise,
    market experience, customer relationships and broad product
    lines, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and Nortel, will
    introduce new products which are designed to compete more
    effectively in the market. There are also several other
    companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities
    than our products. Consolidation in this industry has begun,
    with one or more of these companies being acquired by large,
    established suppliers of network infrastructure products, and we
    believe it is likely to continue.

As a result, we expect to face increased competition in the
    future from larger companies with significantly more resources
    than we have. Although we believe that our technology and the
    purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will
    enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we cannot
    guarantee that we will be successful.

Environment

We are subject to regulations that have been adopted with
    respect to environmental matters, such as the Waste Electrical
    and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and Restriction of
    the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) regulations adopted by
    the European Union. In addition, in September 2007, we announced
    our sponsorship and continued participation in the Carbon
    Disclosure Project (“CDP”). CDP is a global
    standardized mechanism by which companies report their
    greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors; it hosts
    one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data
    in the world at www.cdproject.net. We continue to invest in the
    infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and



measure our carbon footprint on a global basis. Since 2005, we
    have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency
    around the world.

Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted
    for the protection of the environment has to date had no
    material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or
    competitive position.

In addition, we are committed to the environment by our effort
    in improving the energy efficiency of key elements of our
    high-performance network product offerings. For example, our
    T1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive
    products. The environment will remain a focus area across
    multiple aspects of our business.

Intellectual
    Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent
    upon our internally developed technology and know-how. Our
    operating systems were developed internally and are protected by
    United States and other copyright laws.

While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark
    law to protect our technology, we also believe that factors such
    as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new
    product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable
    product maintenance are essential to establishing and
    maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no
    assurance that others will not develop technologies that are
    similar or superior to our technology.

In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into
    certain of our products. From time to time, we may be required
    to license additional technology from third parties to develop
    new products or product enhancements. There can be no assurance
    that third-party licenses will be available or continue to be
    available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability
    to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in
    our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses
    necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could
    require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or
    performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could
    harm our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

Our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary
    intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual
    property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be
    issued on the patent applications that we have filed, or that we
    will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property
    rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual
    property rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had 5,879 full-time
    employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we
    consider our relations with our employees to be good.
    Competition for personnel in our industry is intense. We believe
    that our future success depends in part on our continued ability
    to hire, motivate and retain qualified personnel. We believe
    that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees,
    but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful
    in the future.

Our future performance depends in significant part upon the
    continued service of our key technical, sales and senior
    management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment
    agreement requiring service for any defined period of time. The
    loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. Our future success also
    depends on our continuing ability to attract, train and retain
    highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel.
    Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no
    assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Factors
    That May Affect Future Results

Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies
    involve significant risks. The market price of our stock
    reflects a higher multiple of expected future earnings than many
    other companies. Accordingly, even small changes in investor
    expectations for our future growth and earnings, whether as a
    result of actual or rumored financial or operating results,
    changes in the mix of the products and services sold,
    acquisitions, industry changes or other factors, could trigger,
    and have triggered, significant fluctuations in the market price
    of our common stock. Investors in our securities should
    carefully consider all of the relevant factors, including, but
    not limited to, the following factors, that could affect our
    stock price.

Our
    quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to
    substantial fluctuations and, as a result, we may fail to meet
    the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which
    could adversely affect the trading price of our common
    stock.

Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from
    quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are
    outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock
    price to fluctuate.

The factors that may affect the unpredictability of our
    quarterly results include, but are not limited to, limited
    visibility into customer spending plans, changes in the mix of
    products sold, changing market conditions, including current and
    potential customer consolidation, competition, customer
    concentration, long sales and implementation



cycles, regional economic and political conditions and
    seasonality. For example, many companies in our industry
    experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending
    patterns, particularly in the first and third quarters.

As a result, we believe that

quarter-to-quarter

comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good
    indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely
    that in some future quarters, our operating results may be below
    the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which
    case the price of our common stock may decline. Such a decline
    could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met
    our publicly stated revenue

and/or

earnings guidance.

Fluctuating
    economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a
    particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our
    operating results.

Our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions
    and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
    Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and
    constrained spending on network expansion have previously
    resulted (for example, in 2001 and 2002), and may in the future
    result, in decreased revenues and earnings and could negatively
    impact our ability to forecast and manage our contract
    manufacturer relationships. Economic downturns may also lead to
    restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment
    of investments. In addition, our operating expenses are largely
    based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our
    expenses are, and will continue to be, fixed in the short-term.
    Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult
    to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future
    investments. Future economic weakness, customer financial
    difficulties and reductions in spending on network expansion
    could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products
    and consequently on our results of operations and stock price.

Telecommunications
    companies and other large companies generally require more
    onerous terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to
    sell more products to such customers, we may be required to
    agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on
    our business or ability to recognize revenues.

Telecommunications service provider companies and other large
    companies, because of their size, generally have had greater
    purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received
    more favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous
    terms and conditions for their vendors. As we seek to sell more
    products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree
    to such terms and conditions, which may include terms that
    affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have
    an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
    Consolidation among such large customers can further increase
    their buying power and ability to require onerous terms.

For example, many customers in this class have purchased
    products from other vendors who promised certain functionality
    and failed to deliver such functionality

and/or

had
    products that caused problems and outages in the networks of
    these customers. As a result, this class of customers may
    request additional features from us and require substantial
    penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require
    substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused
    by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we
    are required to agree to them, may affect our ability to
    recognize the revenues from such sales, which may negatively
    affect our business and our financial condition. For example, in
    April 2006, we announced that we would be required to defer a
    large amount of revenue from a customer due to the contractual
    obligations required by that customer.

For arrangements with multiple elements, vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered element is
    required in order to separate the components and to account for
    elements of the arrangement separately. Vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged
    when the element is sold separately. However, customers may
    require terms and conditions that make it more difficult or
    impossible for us to maintain vendor specific objective evidence
    of fair value for the undelivered elements to a similar group of
    customers, the result of which could cause us to defer the
    entire arrangement fees for a similar group of customers
    (product, maintenance, professional services, etc.) and
    recognize revenue only when the last element is delivered or if
    the only undelivered element is maintenance revenue would be
    recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance period which
    is generally one year but could be substantially longer.



If we
    do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products
    and product enhancements that meet those needs, or if those
    products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to
    compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will
    suffer.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future
    market needs or be able to develop new products or product
    enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely
    manner. If we fail to anticipate market requirements or to
    develop new products or product enhancements to meet those
    needs, such failure could substantially decrease market
    acceptance and sales of our present and future products, which
    would significantly harm our business and financial results.
    Even if we are able to anticipate, develop and commercially
    introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no
    assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve
    widespread market acceptance. For example, in the first quarter
    of 2008 we announced new products designed to address the
    Ethernet switch market, a market in which we have not had a
    historical presence. If these new products do not gain market
    acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth, or at all, our
    ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely
    affected. Any failure of our products to achieve market
    acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

We
    expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of
    product gross margin may not be sustainable.

Our product gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter and
    the recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may
    be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors,
    including product mix shifts, increased price competition in one
    or more of the markets in which we compete, increases in
    material or labor costs, excess product component or
    obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers, increased
    costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred
    due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not
    accurately anticipate product demand, warranty related issues,
    or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets
    with different pricing and cost structures.

We
    rely on value-added resellers and distribution partners to sell
    our products, and disruptions to, or our failure to effectively
    develop and manage, our distribution channel and the processes
    and procedures that support it could adversely affect our
    ability to generate revenues from the sale of our
    products.

Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and
    maintaining successful relationships with a variety of
    value-added reseller and distribution partners. The majority of
    our revenues are derived through value-added resellers and
    distributors, most of which also sell competitors’ products
    or their own competitive products. Our revenues depend in part
    on the performance of these partners. The loss of or reduction
    in sales to our value-added resellers or distributors could
    materially reduce our revenues. During 2006, Alcatel, a
    value-added reseller and a competitor of ours, acquired Lucent,
    one of our largest value-added resellers. In addition, in April
    2007 our largest customer, Siemens, transferred its
    telecommunications business to Nokia-Siemens Networks, a joint
    venture between Siemens and Nokia. Our competitors may in some
    cases be effective in providing incentives to current or
    potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or
    to prevent or reduce sales of our products. If we fail to
    maintain relationships with our partners, fail to develop new
    relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new
    markets or expand the number of distributors and resellers in
    existing markets, fail to manage, train or motivate existing
    value-added resellers and distributors effectively or if these
    partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our
    products may decrease and our operating results would suffer.

In addition, we recognize a portion of our revenue based on a
    sell-through model using information provided by our
    distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate
    or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues
    could be adversely impacted.

Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution
    channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and
    procedures that support it, and those processes and procedures
    may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to
    manage. Our failure to successfully manage and develop our
    distribution channel and the processes and procedures that
    support it could adversely affect our ability to generate
    revenues from the sale of our products.



If we
    fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we
    could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays
    which would harm our business.

We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers. If we
    overestimate our requirements, the contract manufacturers may
    assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory,
    each of which could negatively affect our gross margins.
    Conversely, because lead times for required materials and
    components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the
    specific supplier, contract terms and the demand for each
    component at a given time, if we underestimate our requirements,
    the contract manufacturers may have inadequate time or materials
    and components required to produce our products, which could
    increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our
    products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss
    of revenues.

Our
    ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner
    is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of
    the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract
    manufacturers, suppliers or other partners, as well as
    interfaces with the systems of such third parties. If our
    systems, the systems and processes of those third parties or the
    interfaces between them experience delays or fail, our business
    processes and our ability to build and ship products could be
    impacted, and our financial results could be
    harmed.

Some of our business processes depend upon our information
    technology systems, the systems and processes of third parties
    and on interfaces with the systems of third parties. For
    example, our order entry system feeds information into the
    systems of our contract manufacturers, which enables them to
    build and ship our products. If those systems fail or are
    interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished level or
    not at all. This could negatively impact our ability to ship
    products or otherwise operate our business, and our financial
    results could be harmed. For example, although it did not
    adversely affect our shipments, an earthquake in late December
    of 2006 disrupted communications with China, where a significant
    part of our manufacturing occurs.

We also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes
    of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products. If
    those systems and processes experience interruption or delay,
    our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner
    may be harmed. For example, as we have expanded our contract
    manufacturing base to China, we have experienced instances where
    our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the
    time periods expected by us. If we are not able to ship our
    products or if product shipments are delayed, our ability to
    recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be
    affected and our financial results could be harmed.

We are
    dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for
    several key components, which makes us susceptible to shortages
    or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face
    increased challenges in supply chain management in the
    future.

With the current demand for electronic products, component
    shortages are possible and the predictability of the
    availability of such components may be limited. Growth in our
    business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures
    on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component
    demand and to establish optimal component levels. If shortages
    or delays persist, the price of these components may increase,
    or the components may not be available at all. We may not be
    able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of
    acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and
    our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources
    can be developed. For example, throughout the first quarter of
    2006 we experienced component shortages that resulted in delays
    of shipments of product until late in the quarter and in an
    increase in our day sales outstanding. We currently purchase
    numerous key components, including ASICs, from single or limited
    sources. The development of alternate sources for those
    components is time consuming, difficult and costly. In addition,
    the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy
    and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules.
    In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from
    these suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or
    second sources in a timely manner. If, as a result, we are
    unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet
    our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to
    deliver product to our customers, which would seriously impact
    present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect
    our business.



In addition, the development, licensing or acquisition of new
    products in the future may increase the complexity of supply
    chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of
    key components and products would adversely affect our business.

We are
    dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have
    long-term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships,
    expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that
    could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer
    relationships.

We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of which
    is a third-party manufacturer for numerous companies) to
    manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with our
    contract manufacturers, those contracts do not require them to
    manufacture our products on a long-term basis in any specific
    quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is time
    consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional
    contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we should
    fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer
    relationships or if one or more of them should experience
    delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our
    manufacturing operations, or if we had to change or add
    additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing
    sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be
    delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or
    contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our
    supply chain management. Moreover, an increasing portion of our
    manufacturing is performed in China and other countries and is
    therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in
    other countries. Each of these factors could adversely affect
    our business and financial results.

We
    face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and
    adversely affect our financial results.

Competition is intense in the markets that we address. The IP
    infrastructure market has historically been dominated by Cisco
    with other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Extreme
    Networks, Foundry Networks, Huawei, and Nortel providing
    products to a smaller segment of the market. In addition, a
    number of other small public and private companies have products
    or have announced plans for new products to address the same
    challenges and market segments that our products address.

In the service layer technologies market, we face intense
    competition from a broader group of companies including
    appliance vendors such as Cisco, Fortinet, F5 Networks, Nortel
    and Riverbed, and software vendors such as CheckPoint. In
    addition, a number of other small public and private companies
    have products or have announced plans for new products to
    address the same challenges that our products address.

In addition, actual or speculated consolidation among
    competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by
    competitors, can increase the competitive pressures faced by us.
    In this regard, Alcatel combined with Lucent in 2006 and
    Ericsson acquired Redback in 2007. A number of our competitors
    have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range
    of products and services for the overall network equipment
    market than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully
    against existing and future competitors on the basis of product
    offerings or price, we could experience a loss in market share
    and revenues

and/or

be
    required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins,
    and which could materially and adversely affect our business,
    operating results and financial condition.

A
    limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion
    of our revenues and increases the degree of customer
    concentration risk, and any decrease in revenue from these
    customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and
    operating results.

A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a
    limited number of customers and distribution partners.
    Nokia-Siemens Networks B.V. (“NSN”) and its
    predecessor companies contributed more than 10% of revenue in
    the fiscal years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005. This customer
    concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in
    our revenues and operating results. Any downturn in the business
    of our key customers or potential new customers could
    significantly decrease sales to such customers, which could
    adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations. In
    addition, there has been and continues to be consolidation in
    the telecommunications industry (for example, the acquisitions
    of AT&T Inc., MCI, Inc. and BellSouth Corporation) and
    consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications
    equipment and services (for example, the combination of Alcatel
    and Lucent, the joint venture of Nokia-Siemens Networks and the
    acquisition of Redback by Ericsson). Such



consolidation may cause our customers who are involved in these
    acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases
    of our products or have other unforeseen consequences that could
    harm our business and operating results.

We are
    a party to lawsuits, which are costly to investigate and defend
    and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay
    damages or prevent us from taking certain actions, any or all of
    which could harm our business and financial
    condition.

We and certain of our current and former officers and current
    and former members of our board of directors are subject to
    various lawsuits. For example, we have been served with lawsuits
    related to the alleged backdating of stock options and other
    related matters, a description of which can be found in
    Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under
    the heading “Legal Proceedings.” There can be no
    assurance that these or any actions that have been or may be
    brought against us will be resolved in our favor. Regardless of
    whether they are resolved in our favor, these lawsuits are, and
    any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely
    be, expensive and time consuming to investigate, defend

and/or

resolve. Such costs of investigation and defense, as well as any
    losses resulting from these claims, could significantly increase
    our expenses and adversely affect our profitability and cash
    flow.

In addition, we are party to a lawsuit which seeks to enjoin us
    from granting equity awards under our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan
    (the “2006 Plan”), as well as to invalidate all awards
    granted under such plan to date. The 2006 Plan is the only
    active plan under which we currently grant stock options and
    restricted stock units to our employees. If this lawsuit is
    resolved against us, we may be prevented from using the 2006
    Plan to provide these equity awards to recruit new employees or
    to compensate existing employees, which would put us at a
    significant disadvantage to other companies that compete for
    workers in high technology industries such as ours. Accordingly,
    our ability to hire, retain and motivate current and prospective
    employees would be harmed, the result of which could negatively
    impact our business operations.

We are
    currently implementing upgrades to key internal IT systems, and
    problems with the design or implementation of these systems
    could interfere with our business and operations.

We have initiated a project to upgrade certain key internal IT
    systems, including our company-wide human resources management
    system and our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”)
    system. We have invested, and will continue to invest,
    significant capital and human resources in the design and
    implementation of these systems, which may be disruptive to our
    underlying business. Any disruptions or delays in the design and
    implementation of the new systems, particularly any disruptions
    or delays that impact our operations, could adversely affect our
    ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide
    services and support to our customers, bill and track our
    customers, fulfill contractual obligations, file SEC reports in
    a timely manner and otherwise run our business. Even if we do
    not encounter these adverse effects, the design and
    implementation of these new systems may be much more costly than
    we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully design and
    implement these new systems as planned, our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows could be negatively
    impacted.

Litigation
    or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be time
    consuming, expensive and require a significant amount of
    resources to prosecute, defend or make our products
    non-infringing.

Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims
    or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark
    and other intellectual property rights to technologies and
    related standards that are relevant to our products. The
    asserted claims

and/or

initiated litigation may include claims against us or our
    manufacturers, suppliers or customers, alleging infringement of
    their proprietary rights with respect to our products.
    Regardless of the merit of these claims, they have been and can
    be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and may require
    us to develop non-infringing technologies or enter into license
    agreements. Furthermore, because of the potential for high
    awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily
    predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled
    for significant amounts of money. If any infringement or other
    intellectual property claim made against us by any third-party
    is successful, if we are required to settle litigation for
    significant amounts of money, or if we fail to develop
    non-infringing technology or license required proprietary rights
    on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business,
    operating results and financial condition could be materially
    and adversely affected.



We are
    exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could
    negatively affect our financial results and cash
    flows.

Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the
    United States, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could have a
    material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.

Our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in
    U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses are denominated in
    U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including
    the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese
    Yen, related to our operations outside of the United States. An
    increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the
    real cost to our customers of our products in those markets
    outside the United States where we sell in U.S. dollars,
    and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating
    expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must
    purchase components in foreign currencies. A decrease in the
    value of the U.S. dollar could also increase the real cost
    to us of our expenses in countries outside the United States.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated
    with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional
    currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign
    currency operating expenses. The hedging activities undertaken
    by us are intended to partially offset the impact of currency
    fluctuations. If our attempts to hedge against these risks are
    not successful, our net income could be adversely impacted.

We are
    required to expense equity compensation given to our employees,
    which has reduced our reported earnings, will significantly harm
    our operating results in future periods and may reduce our stock
    price and our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation
    to attract and retain employees.

We historically have used stock options and other equity awards
    as a significant component of our employee compensation program
    in order to align employees’ interests with the interests
    of our stockholders, encourage employee retention, and provide
    competitive compensation packages. The Financial Accounting
    Standards Board has adopted changes that require companies to
    record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and
    other equity incentives. We adopted this standard effective
    January 1, 2006. By causing us to record significantly
    increased compensation costs, such accounting changes have
    reduced, and will continue to reduce, our reported earnings and
    will significantly harm our operating results in future periods.
    These factors may require us to reduce the availability and
    amount of equity incentives provided to employees, which may
    make it more difficult for us to attract, retain and motivate
    key personnel. Moreover, if securities analysts, institutional
    investors and other investors adopt financial models that
    include stock option expense in their primary analysis of our
    financial results, our stock price could decline as a result of
    reliance on these models with higher expense calculations. Each
    of these results could materially and adversely affect our
    business.

Matters
    related to the investigation into our historical stock option
    granting practices and the restatement of our financial
    statements may result in additional litigation, regulatory
    proceedings and government enforcement actions.

Our historical stock option granting practices and the
    restatement of our financial statements have exposed us to
    greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings
    and government enforcement actions. For more information
    regarding our current litigation and related inquiries, please
    see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    under the heading “Legal Proceedings” as well as the
    other risk factors related to litigation set forth in this
    section. We have provided the results of our internal review and
    independent investigation to the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) and the United States
    Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California,
    and in that regard we have responded to formal and informal
    requests for documents and additional information. In August
    2007, we announced that we entered into a settlement agreement
    with the SEC in connection with our historical stock option
    granting practices in which we consented to a permanent
    injunction against any future violations of the antifraud,
    reporting,

books-and-records

and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.
    This settlement concludes the SEC’s formal investigation of
    the Company with respect to this matter. No assurance can be
    given regarding the outcomes from the current litigation or
    other possible actions relating to our past stock option
    practices. The resolution of these matters will be time
    consuming, expensive, and may distract management from the
    conduct of our business. Furthermore, if we are subject to
    adverse findings in



litigation, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or
    have other remedies imposed, which could harm our business,
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, while we believe that we have made appropriate
    judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for our
    stock option grants, the SEC may disagree with the manner in
    which we accounted for and reported, or did not report, the
    corresponding financial impact. Accordingly, there is a risk
    that we may have to further restate our prior financial
    statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other
    actions not currently contemplated.

If we
    fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control
    and reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and
    grow our business will be negatively affected.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our
    business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an
    effective planning and management process. We will need to
    continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our
    reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business
    effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement
    improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our
    business and results of operations may be negatively affected.

Our
    success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage
    our resources and restructure our business through rapidly
    fluctuating economic and market conditions.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a
    rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning,
    forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively
    scale our business and adjust our business in response to
    fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. In periods of
    market expansion, we have increased investment in our business
    by, for example, increasing headcount and increasing our
    investment in research and development and other parts of our
    business. Conversely, during 2001 and 2002, in response to
    downward trending industry and market conditions, we
    restructured our business and reduced our workforce. Many of our
    expenses, such as real estate expenses, cannot be rapidly or
    easily adjusted as a result of fluctuations in our business or
    numbers of employees. Moreover, rapid changes in the size of our
    workforce could adversely affect the ability to develop and
    deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability
    to realize our current or future business objectives.

Our
    ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed if
    we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
    retain the services of executive, engineering, sales, marketing
    and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified
    individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized
    technical areas, or sales people specializing in the service
    provider and enterprise markets, is limited and competition for
    such individuals is intense. None of our officers or key
    employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific
    term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the
    inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays
    in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers and sales
    people, and the complexity and time involved in replacing or
    training new employees, could delay the development and
    introduction of new products, and negatively impact our ability
    to market, sell or support our products.

We
    sell our products to customers that use those products to build
    networks and IP infrastructure and, if the demand for network
    and IP systems does not continue to grow, then our business,
    operating results and financial condition could be adversely
    affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the
    growth of secure IP infrastructure and on the deployment of our
    products by customers that depend on the continued growth of IP
    services. As a result of changes in the economy and capital
    spending or the building of network capacity in excess of
    demand, all of which have in the past particularly affected
    telecommunications service providers, spending on IP
    infrastructure can vary, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business and financial results. In addition, a
    number of our existing customers are evaluating the build out of
    their next generation network, or NGN. During the decision
    making period when the customers are determining the design of
    those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use
    in



those networks, such customers may greatly reduce or suspend
    their spending on secure IP infrastructure. Such pauses in
    purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from
    such customers, can cause fluctuations in the level of spending
    by these customers and, even where our products are ultimately
    selected, can have a material adverse effect on our business and
    financial results.

The
    long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well
    as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place
    large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues and
    operating results to vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter.

A customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products
    involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy
    evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the
    sales cycle may be lengthy. In particular, customers making
    critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of
    large or next-generation networks may engage in very lengthy
    procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future
    orders. Throughout the sales cycle, we may spend considerable
    time educating and providing information to prospective
    customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even
    after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our
    products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary
    widely and depends on the skill set of the customer, the size of
    the network deployment, the complexity of the customer’s
    network environment and the degree of hardware and operating
    system configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers
    with large networks usually expand their networks in large
    increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive
    purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular
    basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation that
    customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with
    short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to
    vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.

Integration
    of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our
    business and harm our financial condition and stock price and
    may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.

We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to
    enhance our business. In 2005 we completed the acquisitions of
    five private companies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
    including problems combining the purchased operations,
    technologies or products, unanticipated costs, diversion of
    management’s attention from our core businesses, adverse
    effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
    customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we
    have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key
    employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies or
    personnel that we might acquire. The integration of businesses
    that we have acquired has been, and will continue to be, a
    complex, time consuming and expensive process. Acquisitions may
    also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership
    of our current stockholders, assume liabilities, record goodwill
    and

non-amortizable

intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on
    a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur
    amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and
    incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other
    related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results
    and financial condition.

In addition, if we fail in our integration efforts with respect
    to our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a
    combined organization utilizing common information and
    communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls
    and human resources practices, our business and financial
    condition may be adversely affected.

Our
    products are highly technical and if they contain undetected
    errors, our business could be adversely affected and we might
    have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any
    alleged or actual failure of our products and
    services.

Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to
    the operation of many networks and, in the case of our security
    products, provide and monitor network security and may protect
    valuable information. Our products have contained and may
    contain one or more undetected errors, defects or security
    vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be
    discovered after a product has been installed and used by end
    customers. Any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in
    our products after commercial release could result in loss of
    revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and
    increased service and warranty cost, any of which could
    adversely



affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we
    could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of
    warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is
    costly and may divert management’s attention. In addition,
    if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or
    future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all,
    our financial condition could be harmed.

A
    breach of network security could harm public perception of our
    security products, which could cause us to lose
    revenues.

If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in
    the network of a customer of our security products, regardless
    of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the
    market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be
    harmed. This could cause us to lose current and potential end
    customers or cause us to lose current and potential value-added
    resellers and distributors. Because the techniques used by
    computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change
    frequently and generally are not recognized until launched
    against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these
    techniques.

If our
    products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks,
    installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our
    business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’
    existing networks, each of which have different specifications
    and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other
    vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple
    generations of products that have been added over time as these
    networks have grown and evolved. Our products will be required
    to interoperate with many or all of the products within these
    networks as well as future products in order to meet our
    customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing
    software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’
    networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix
    or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate
    and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could
    be costly and negatively impact our operating results. In
    addition, if our products do not interoperate with those of our
    customers’ networks, demand for our products could be
    adversely affected or orders for our products could be
    cancelled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our
    reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects.

Governmental
    regulations affecting the import or export of products could
    negatively affect our revenues.

The United States and various other governments have imposed
    controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the
    import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
    technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental
    agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption
    technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental
    recovery of private encryption keys. Governmental regulation of
    encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or
    our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our
    products, could harm our international and domestic sales and
    adversely affect our revenues.

Due to
    the global nature of our operations, economic or social
    conditions or changes in a particular country or region could
    adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses,
    which could have a material adverse impact on our financial
    condition.

We conduct significant sales and customer support operations
    directly and indirectly through our distributors and value-added
    resellers in countries throughout the world and also depend on
    the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that
    are located inside and outside of the United States. In
    addition, our research and development operations are conducted
    in the United States as well as other countries. Our future
    results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of
    uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others,
    political or social unrest, natural disasters, epidemic disease,
    war, or economic instability in a specific country or region,
    trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements
    which may affect our ability to import or export our products
    from various countries, service provider and government spending
    patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties
    in staffing and managing international operations. Any or all of
    these factors could have a material adverse impact on our
    revenue, costs, expenses, results of operations and financial
    condition.



Our
    products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party
    technology and if licenses of third-party technology do not
    continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our
    revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could
    be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our
    products. From time to time, we may be required to license
    additional technology from third parties to develop new products
    or product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be
    available or continue to be available to us on commercially
    reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any
    third-party licenses required in our products or our inability
    to obtain

third-party

licenses necessary to develop new products and product
    enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute technology
    of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost,
    any of which could harm our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We are
    subject to risks arising from our international
    operations.

We derive a majority of our revenues from our international
    operations, and we plan to continue expanding our business in
    international markets in the future. As a result of our
    international operations, we are affected by economic,
    regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries,
    including changes in IT spending generally, the imposition of
    government controls, changes or limitations in trade protection
    laws, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws, natural
    disasters, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions,
    misappropriation of intellectual property, acts of terrorism and
    continued unrest in many regions and other factors, which could
    have a material impact on our international revenues and
    operations. In particular, in some countries we may experience
    reduced intellectual property protection. Moreover, local laws
    and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in
    the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in
    those with developing economies, it is common for others to
    engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal
    policies and procedures or United States regulations applicable
    to us. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to
    ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no
    assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents will
    not take actions in violations of them. Violations of laws or
    key control policies by our employees, contractors or agents
    could result in financial reporting problems, fines, penalties,
    or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products
    and could have a material adverse effect on our business.

While
    we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, we are exposed to risks from legislation
    requiring companies to evaluate those internal
    controls.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our
    management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest
    to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and
    process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these
    requirements. We have and will continue to incur significant
    expenses and devote management resources to Section 404
    compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that our chief
    executive officer, chief financial officer or independent
    registered public accounting firm determine in the future that
    our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective
    as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions may be
    adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price
    of our stock.

Regulation
    of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating
    results and future prospects.

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our
    business and financial condition could be adversely affected by
    changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications
    industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that
    apply directly to access to or commerce on IP networks. We could
    be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce
    in any country where we operate. Such regulations could address
    matters such as voice over the Internet or using Internet
    Protocol, encryption technology, and access charges for service
    providers. In addition, regulations have been adopted with
    respect to environmental matters, such as the Waste Electrical
    and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and Restriction of
    the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) regulations adopted by
    the European Union, as well as regulations prohibiting
    government entities from purchasing security products that do
    not meet specified local certification criteria. Compliance with
    such regulations may be costly and time-consuming for us and our
    suppliers and partners. The adoption and implementation of such
    regulations could decrease demand for our products, and at



the same time could increase the cost of building and selling
    our products as well as impact our ability to ship products into
    affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
    results and financial condition.

Our
    reported financial results could suffer if there is an
    additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets
    with indefinite lives.

We are required to annually test, and review on an interim
    basis, our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives,
    including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any
    future acquisitions, to determine if impairment has occurred. If
    such assets are deemed impaired, an impairment loss equal to the
    amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of
    the assets would be recognized. This would result in incremental
    expenses for that quarter which would reduce any earnings or
    increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was
    determined to have occurred. For example, such impairment could
    occur if the market value of our common stock falls below
    certain levels for a sustained period or if the portions of our
    business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at
    expected rates or decline. In the second quarter of 2006, this
    impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of
    $1,280.0 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our
    balance sheet for the SLT segment, primarily due to the decline
    in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of
    approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and, to
    a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows
    used in the income approach. Declines in our stock prices in the
    future as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or
    gross margins increase the risk that goodwill and intangible
    assets may become impaired in future periods. We cannot
    accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of
    assets.

Changes
    in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from
    examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely
    affect our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or
    adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in
    countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than
    anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory
    rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets
    and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax
    credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments related to certain
    acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under
    our intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement; by tax
    effects of stock-based compensation; by costs related to
    intercompany restructurings; or by changes in tax laws,
    regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.
    In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our
    income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
    authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
    outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
    adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no
    assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations
    will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and
    financial condition.

The
    investment of our cash balance and our investments in government
    and corporate debt securities are subject to risks which may
    cause losses and affect the liquidity of these
    investments.

At December 31, 2007, we had $1,716.1 million in cash
    and cash equivalents and $291.1 million in investments in
    government and corporate debt securities. We have invested these
    amounts in U.S. government securities, corporate notes and
    bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds meeting certain
    criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general
    credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be
    exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have
    affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused
    credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with
    our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on
    our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Uninsured
    losses could harm our operating results.

We self-insure against many business risks and expenses, such as
    intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit
    programs, where we believe we can adequately self-insure against
    the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either
    not deemed cost-effective or is not available. We also maintain
    a program of insurance coverage for various types of property,
    casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with
    various carriers in numerous jurisdictions. The types and
    amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and



from location to location, depending on availability, cost, and
    our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are
    subject to deductibles, policy limits and exclusions that result
    in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis.
    Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and
    unpredictable and could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Report”), including the “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations”, contains forward-looking statements regarding
    future events and the future results of our Company that are
    based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and
    projections about the industry in which we operate and the
    beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as
    ‘expects,’ ‘anticipates,’
    ‘targets,’ ‘goals,’ ‘projects,’
    ‘intends,’ ‘plans,’ ‘believes,’
    ‘seeks,’ ‘estimates,’ variations of such
    words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such
    forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are
    only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
    assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual
    results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed
    in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or
    contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to,
    those discussed in this Report under the section entitled
    “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I and
    elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”), specifically the most
    recent reports on

Form 10-Q.

We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any
    forward-looking statements for any reason.

The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated
    Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which
    have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
    these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we
    routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of
    invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and
    shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of
    supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among
    other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the
    financial results for any given period. In making these
    decisions, we consider various factors including contractual
    obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and
    external financial targets and expectations, and financial
    planning objectives. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
    estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing
    credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts,
    impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and
    intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying
    and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation
    of stock-based compensation, and litigation. We base our
    estimates on historical experience and on various other
    assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions.

To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods
    covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview
    and a summary of the significant events that affected the most
    recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our
    operating expenses. These sections should be read in conjunction
    with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our
    “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A of
    Part I, and our audited consolidated financial statements
    and notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.



Executive
    Overview

Our 2007 performance was the result of a combination of strong
    market demand for networking and security products as well as
    our focused execution and market share gains. In addition, we
    began shipment of several new products which contributed to our
    revenue growth during the year. During 2007, we also implemented
    a series of operational excellence initiatives. These
    initiatives are intended to strengthen the management systems
    and processes throughout our organization to support our growth.

Net Revenues:

Net revenue increased
    $532.5 million, or 23%, to $2,836.1 million in 2007,
    compared to 2006. We experienced growth in both product and
    service revenues, which represented 82.0% and 18.0% of our total
    net revenue in 2007. Product revenue increased
    $433.7 million, or 23%, to $2,327.0 million in 2007,
    compared to the year-ago period. Service revenue increased
    $98.8 million, or 24%, to $509.1 million in 2007,
    compared to 2006. Infrastructure product, SLT product and
    Service revenues represented 61.8%, 20.2% and 18.0% of our total
    net revenues, respectively, for 2007. Our revenue performance
    and share gains were driven by Infrastructure product and SLT
    product sales. Infrastructure product revenue increased
    $339.8 million, or 24%, in 2007 as compared to 2006
    primarily attributable to revenue growth in our M- and T-series
    routers, as well as our recently introduced MX-series routers.
    SLT product revenue increased in 2007 as compared to 2006
    primarily attributable to the increased sales of our firewall
    virtual private network (“Firewall”) products,
    including our recently introduced SSG320M and SSG350M firewall
    appliances, and to a lesser extent, increases in secure socket
    layer virtual private network (“SSL”), J-series, and
    WAN Optimization products. Service revenue increased in 2007
    over the prior year primarily due to the increase in our
    installed base of equipment under service contracts and, to a
    lesser extent, growth in professional service revenue.

New Infrastructure products shipped in 2007 include the T1600
    router and our MX-series product family. Our T1600 product is a
    high-capacity and energy-efficient core router. Our MX-series
    family of Ethernet Service Routers enables service providers to
    deliver advance services including IPTV and

video-on-demand

at scale. The MX-series includes MX960, a large capacity and
    high-density Carrier Ethernet platform, and MX480, which began
    shipping in the fourth quarter of 2007.

New SLT products introduced in 2007 include the SSG320M and
    SSG350M products, which are purpose-built appliances that
    deliver high performance and secure connectivity for regional
    and branch office. We also introduced new products within the
    J-series service router family, such as J2320 and J2350, which
    are designed to enable enterprises to accelerate the secure
    delivery of business critical applications across their
    networks. Additionally, we continued to make enhancements and
    design updates to other SLT product families during 2007.



From a geographical perspective, net revenues grew across the
    Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and
    Asia Pacific (“APAC”) regions.

•

Operating Margin:

Operating income increased
    $1,404.9 million to $407.1 million in 2007, compared
    to an operating loss of $997.8 million in 2006. Operating
    margin was 14.4% in 2007 as compared to -43.3% in 2006. The
    increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to
    decreases in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue.
    Such decreases were largely due to the goodwill and intangible
    impairment charges of $1,283.4 million in 2006 and the
    absence of such charges in 2007. Additionally, to a lesser
    extent, operating margin improved due to the decrease in sales
    and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue as well as
    decreases in other charges associated with our internal stock
    option investigation, partially offset by increases in research
    and development expenses in 2007 as compared to 2006.

•

Net Income and Net Income Per Share:

Net
    income was $360.8 million, or $0.62 per share on a diluted
    basis, in 2007, compared to a net loss of $1,001.4 million,
    or $1.76 per share on a diluted basis, in 2006. The increases in
    2007 were primarily attributable to the goodwill and intangible
    impairment charges of $1,283.4 million in 2006 that were
    absent in 2007 as well as the revenue growth and an increase in
    operating margin as discussed above.

•

Other Financial Highlights:

We used
    $1,623.2 million to repurchase 69.4 million shares of
    our common stock in 2007. Cash used in our stock repurchases was
    offset by cash flows from operating activities, investing
    activities and common stock issued to our employees in
    connection with our equity incentive plans of
    $786.5 million, $571.8 million, and
    $355.0 million, respectively, in 2007.

Significant
    Events

Business
    and Market Environment

In 2007, we benefited from the continued progress by our service
    provider customers in the build-out of Next Generation Networks
    (“NGN”) designed to support a fast and cost-effective
    deployment of multiple types of services (“multi-play
    services”), such as voice, data, and video, that enable our
    customers to develop new sources of revenue and profitability.
    We maintained a strong position in the Infrastructure product
    business and gained share in key market segments. We also
    experienced an increased interest in our SLT portfolio due to
    increased network demand from our enterprise customers as well
    as growth from service providers using our SLT products for both
    managed service offerings and outsourced solutions for their
    customers. Additionally, we continued our momentum in the
    enterprise market for our SLT products as well as routing
    products portfolio. We now serve over 95 of the Fortune
    100 companies and more than 30,000 enterprise customers
    worldwide. In addition, over 45 out of the 50 state
    governments in the United States have deployed our technologies.

We believe our innovation and market momentum have enabled us to
    maintain relationships with our partners, including strategic
    resellers Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Inc., and Nokia-Siemens
    Networks B.V. (“NSN”), while developing broader
    relationships with technology leaders such as International
    Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) and Microsoft
    Corporation to better serve our customers.

Stock
    Repurchase Activity

We repurchased and retired 69.4 million common shares, at
    an average price of $23.37 per share for a total of
    $1,623.2 million as part of our $2.0 billion common
    stock repurchase program approved by our Board in July 2006 and
    February 2007 (the “2006 Stock Repurchase Program”).
    As of December 31, 2007, our 2006 Stock Repurchase Program
    had a remaining authorization of $376.8 million for
    repurchases. See Note 15 in Item 8 for discussion of
    our stock repurchase activity in 2008.

Stock
    Option Investigation and Amendment of Certain Stock
    Options

In 2007, we completed the restatement of our historical
    financial statements as a result of our independent stock option
    investigation and review of historical stock compensation
    practices. In addition, we regained compliance with listing
    standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We recorded
    $6.0 million in operating



expenses during 2007 in connection with this stock option
    investigation, compared to $20.5 million and nil in 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

In April 2007, we completed a tender offer to amend certain
    options granted under the Juniper Networks, Inc.
    Amended & Restated 1996 Stock Plan and the Juniper
    Networks, Inc. 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan that had
    original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair
    market value per share of the common stock underlying the option
    on the option’s grant date, as determined by us for
    financial accounting purposes. Under this tender offer,
    employees subject to taxation in the United States and Canada
    had the opportunity to increase their strike price on affected
    options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the
    date of grant so as to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under
    United States Internal Revenue Code Section 409A
    (“409A issue”) or Canadian tax laws and regulations.
    In exchange for increasing the strike price of these options, we
    committed to make a cash payment to employees participating in
    the offer so as to make these employees whole for the
    incremental strike price as compared to their original option
    exercise price. In connection with the offer, we amended options
    to purchase 4.3 million shares of our common stock in 2007
    and made aggregate cash payments of $7.6 million to offer
    participants in January 2008. We accrued this aggregate payment
    liability and recognized an operating expense for the
    corresponding amount during 2007.

Settlement
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission

On August 28, 2007, we announced that the Commissioners of
    the SEC authorized the settlement between us and the SEC
    regarding the previously disclosed SEC inquiry into our
    historical stock option granting practices. Without admitting or
    denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, we agreed
    to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction
    against any future violations of the antifraud, reporting,

books-and-records

and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.
    No monetary penalties were assessed against us in conjunction
    with this settlement. This settlement concludes the SEC’s
    formal investigation of the company with respect to our
    historical stock option granting practices.

Adoption
    of FIN 48

We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

(“FIN 48”) on
    January 1, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2007. Under
    FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to
    recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than
    not” threshold. The cumulative effect of applying
    FIN 48 was a $19.2 million increase to the opening
    balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 and a
    $1.0 million increase to goodwill.

As of the date of adoption, the total amount of gross
    unrecognized tax benefits was $85.2 million, of which
    $70.8 million, if recognized, would affect our effective
    tax rate.

In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued
    interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a
    component of tax expense in the consolidated statement of
    operations. This policy did not change as a result of the
    adoption of FIN 48. We accrued interest expense and
    penalties of $4.1 million within other long-term
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of the date of
    adoption.

We conduct business globally and, as a result, we or one or more
    of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
    U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
    jurisdictions. In the normal course of business we are subject
    to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world,
    including such major jurisdictions as Ireland, Hong Kong, U.K.,
    France, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, China, Australia, and
    the U.S. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to
    U.S. federal, state and local, or

non-U.S. income

tax examinations for years before 2003, although carryforward
    attributes that were generated prior to 2003 may still be
    adjusted upon examination by the IRS if the attributes either
    have been or will be used in a future period.



Nature of
    Expenses

Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations
    are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers.
    Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments
    to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard
    product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce
    our products using design specifications, quality assurance
    programs and standards that we establish. Controls around
    manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at
    our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford,
    Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have
    facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United
    States. We generally do not own the components and title to
    products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and
    immediately to our customers upon shipment.

The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build
    forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our
    forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for
    carrying or obsolete material charges.

We have employees in our manufacturing and operations
    organization who manage relationships with our contract
    manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product
    testing and quality.

Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver
    of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue.
    Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions,
    bonuses, vacation, benefits, stock-based compensation and
    travel. We had 5,879, 4,833, and 4,145 employees as of
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The

year-over-year

increases were primarily attributable to increases in our
    research and development, sales and customer service activities.
    Our headcount is expected to increase in 2008 as we continue to
    expand these functions. We accounted for stock-based
    compensation under the fair value approach of FAS 123R in
    2007 and 2006. In 2005, we accounted for stock-based
    compensation under the intrinsic value approach of APB 25.
    Details of our stock-based compensation expense are described in
    Note 1 and Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements of this

Form 10-K.

Facility and information technology departmental costs are
    allocated to other departments based on headcount. These
    departmental costs have increased in 2007 and 2006 due to
    increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from
    infrastructure systems added to support our growth and past
    acquisitions. Facility and information technology related
    headcount was 224, 177, and 168 as of December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005, respectively. In 2008, we expect to further
    invest in our company-wide information technology infrastructure
    as we implement our operational excellence initiatives.

Our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars as
    well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound,
    the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Changes in related
    currency exchange rates may affect our operating results.
    Periodically, we use foreign currency forward

and/or

option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to operating expenses. The effective
    portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially
    reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is
    subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of
    operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates.
    Any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in
    other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of
    operations. The increase in operating expenses including
    research and development, sales and marketing, as well as
    general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency
    fluctuations, net of hedging, was approximately 2% in 2007.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses
    in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and
    assumptions. We base our estimates and assumptions on current
    facts, historical experience and various other factors that we
    believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
    which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may
    differ materially and adversely from management’s
    estimates. To the extent there are material differences between
    our estimates and the actual results, our future results of
    operations will be affected.



We believe the following critical accounting policies require us
    to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation
    of our consolidated financial statements:

Our products are
    integrated with software that is essential to the functionality
    of our equipment. Additionally, we provide unspecified upgrades
    and enhancements related to our integrated software through our
    maintenance contracts for most of our products. Accordingly, we
    account for revenue in accordance with Statement of Position

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition,

and all related
    interpretations. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence
    of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred,
    the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
    reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally
    consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain instances,
    sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and related
    documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when
    applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. In
    instances where we have outstanding obligations related to
    product delivery or the final acceptance of the product, revenue
    is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have
    been met. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or
    determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price
    is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility
    based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by
    credit checks and the customer’s payment history to us.
    Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts, estimated customer returns and pricing credits.

For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of
    products that include services, we allocate revenue to each
    element using the residual method based on vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. Under
    the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to
    delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration
    less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements.
    Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the
    price charged when the element is sold separately. We then
    recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our
    policies for product and service revenue recognition. If vendor
    specific objective evidence of fair value of one or more
    undelivered items does not exist, revenue is deferred and
    recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of those elements
    or (ii) when fair value can be established unless
    maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the
    entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
    contractual support period. Our ability to recognize revenue in
    the future may be affected if actual selling prices are
    significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to
    recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions
    imposed by our customers.

For sales to direct end-users and value-added resellers, we
    recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of
    loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to
    identify an end-user prior to shipment to a value-added
    reseller. For our end-users and value-added resellers, there are
    no significant obligations for future performance such as rights
    of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made
    through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing
    credits

and/or

rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made
    through these distributors upon sell-through as reported to us
    by the distributors. Deferred revenue on shipments to
    distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits
    and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon
    sell-through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related
    product costs of revenue.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns
    and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection,
    in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The
    amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns
    and price protection credits, specific criteria included in
    rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time.
    Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product
    returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. In
    addition, we report revenue net of sales taxes.

Services include maintenance, training and professional
    services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts.
    Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is
    recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is
    generally one to three years. Revenue from training and
    professional services is recognized as the services are
    completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is
    generally one year or less.

We sell certain interests in accounts receivables as part of a
    distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement which was
    established by us with a major financing company. Accounts
    receivables sold under



this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition are accounted
    for as debt and were $10.0 million and nil as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

•

Contract Manufacturer Liabilities.

We
    outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain
    management operations to our independent contract manufacturers
    and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of
    payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure
    components and manufacture our products based on our demand
    forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future
    demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical
    trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing
    organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We
    establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material
    charges for excess components purchased based on historical
    trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are
    significantly lower than forecasted, which may be caused by
    factors outside of our control, we have contractual liabilities
    and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such
    as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, which would
    have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability.

•

Warranty Reserve.

We generally offer a
    one-year warranty on all of our hardware products and a

90-day

warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the
    products. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty
    costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in
    extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty
    obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of
    materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead
    incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual
    product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery
    costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves
    could be required, which could reduce gross margins.

•

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
    Assets.

Goodwill is recorded as the difference,
    if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an
    acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and
    intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives
    assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing
    of future amortization, and the amount assigned to in-process
    research and development is expensed immediately. The value of
    our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by
    future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our
    operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of
    technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common
    stock, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy
    or the networking industry or (iv) failure to meet the
    performance projections included in our forecasts of future
    operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis
    as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of
    impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment
    review, we use the market approach as well as the income
    approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted
    cash flow method to determine the fair value of our intangible
    assets. Significant management judgment is required in the
    forecasts of future operating results that are used in the
    discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have
    used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to
    manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and
    estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the
    plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are
    lower than the original estimates used to assess the
    recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional
    impairment charges.

•

Stock-Based Compensation.

We account for
    stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS No. 123R
    beginning in 2006. Under the provisions of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“FAS 123R”),
    stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date
    based on the award’s fair value as calculated by the
    Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model and
    is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service
    period. The BSM model requires various highly subjective
    assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected
    option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model
    change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may
    differ materially in the future from that recorded in the
    current period. In conjunction with the adoption of
    FAS 123R, we also adopted the single-approach method for
    valuing our stock-based awards as well as the straight-line
    method for amortizing the related stock-based compensation
    expense under the modified prospective approach. Prior to the
    adoption of FAS 123R, we accounted for stock-based compensation
    under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”).



•

Income Taxes.

Estimates and judgments occur in
    the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the
    determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax
    assets, which arise from temporary differences and
    carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
    using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable
    income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are
    expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the
    likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from
    recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income
    based on the realization criteria set forth under FAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

and record a valuation
    allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that
    we believe to be more likely than not realizable. We believe it
    is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the
    tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient
    to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event
    that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined
    not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the
    valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period
    such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently
    realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to
    be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be
    reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a
    decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made.
    In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves
    dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
    regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our
    estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes
    will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be
    unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax
    benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the
    liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax
    liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a
    further charge to expense would result.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 is
    an interpretation of FASB Statement 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, and it seeks to reduce the diversity in
    practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and
    recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax
    return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on
    de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. Under
    FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to
    recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than
    not” threshold. In addition, the application of FIN 48
    may increase an entity’s future effective tax rates and its
    future intra-period effective tax rate volatility. Our
    cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was a
    $19.2 million increase to the opening balance of
    accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 and a
    $1.0 million increase to goodwill.

•

Loss Contingencies.

We are subject to the
    possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the
    ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss
    or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as
    well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss,
    in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency
    is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired
    or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information
    available to us to determine whether such accruals should be
    adjusted and whether new accruals are required. In addition,
    from time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and
    other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current
    litigation matters; however, there are many uncertainties
    associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third
    party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation

and/or

substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of
    any future intellectual property litigation may require us to
    make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross
    margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur,
    our business, financial condition and results of operations and
    cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We record
    a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for
    litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the
    following conditions are met: (i) information available
    prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it
    is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had
    been incurred at the date of the financial statements and
    (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated.
    However, the actual liability in any such litigation may be
    materially different from our estimates, which could result in
    the need to record additional expenses.

Our total net revenues increased $532.5 million, or 23% to

    revenues increased $239.6 million, or 12% to
    $2,303.6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increases
    in both years were primarily due to the demand growth in the
    markets we serve. In addition, we gained market share in several
    areas and capitalized on the opportunities in our targeted
    markets with our new and existing product and service offerings
    during 2007.

Net
    Product Revenues

Our net product revenue increased $433.7 million, or 23%,
    from 2006 to $2,327.0 million in 2007. The increase was the
    result of increased activity in both Infrastructure product and
    SLT product sales to service provider and enterprise markets. In
    particular we had success in selling our products to customers
    who are adopting NGN IP networks, which are designed to reduce
    total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services
    over a single network. In addition, we had a number of new
    product releases and expanded into new emerging markets during
    2007. Net product revenue grew $122.3 million, or 7% from
    2005 to 2006, the majority of which was generated from our SLT
    product revenue growth in 2006.

Infrastructure
    Product Revenues

Infrastructure product revenues accounted for
    $1,753.2 million, or 61.8%, of total net revenues, and
    increased $339.8 million, or 24%, in 2007, compared to
    2006. We benefited from the strong worldwide demand for
    high-performance router products as our service provider
    customers seek simplified, scalable network infrastructures
    across fiber, cable and mobile access technologies to support
    increasing performance demands on their networks. The
    Infrastructure product revenue increase in 2007 was primarily
    attributable to increased revenue from our M-, T-, and



MX-series router products driven by our service provider
    customers’ continued build out of NGN as their bandwidth
    requirement increases. Our service provider customers also moved
    towards NGNs designed to enable a fast and cost-effective
    deployment of differentiating multi-play services that allow
    them to generate new sources of revenue. Also contributing to
    the revenue growth was an increase in Infrastructure product
    sales to the content service provider and the enterprise
    markets. From a geographical perspective, we experienced
    strength in the Americas region. We also experienced revenue
    increases in APAC and EMEA.

Infrastructure products accounted for $1,413.4 million, or
    61.4%, of our total net revenues during 2006 and
    $1,371.6 million, or 66.5%, of our total net revenues
    during 2005. Infrastructure product net revenue grew by
    $41.8 million, or 3%, from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to
    continued success from a very significant year of growth in
    2005, which strengthened our position as a supplier to the
    largest service providers in the world, particularly in the
    Americas and in EMEA. We experienced revenue growth in
    higher-end infrastructure chassis products and increased
    penetration by our core and edge router portfolio as service
    providers acquired products for their NGNs and multi-play
    service offerings. This growth was partially offset by a pause
    in the build out of NGNs and associated purchase decisions,
    particularly in Japan, as major carriers prepare for the next
    stage of bandwidth and services expansion, and a large product
    revenue deferral as of December 31, 2006 for products
    shipped to one of our largest customers.

We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units recognized and
    ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of
    potential network growth. Our Infrastructure product platforms
    are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of
    the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that
    are available to be populated with components we refer to as
    modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through
    which the router receives incoming packets of data from a
    variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a
    transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The
    number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the
    functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis
    revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue
    was recognized during the period. The following table shows
    infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped:

Chassis revenue units increased 10% from 2006 to 2007 as our
    customers expanded the capacity in their existing networks. The
    increase was mainly due to the introduction of the MX-series
    products, which are our Carrier Ethernet base routers. We also
    experienced growth in our M- and T-series products, driven by
    bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand
    voice and video capability in their existing networks. Port
    shipment units increased by 41% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The
    increase was associated with the growth in chassis revenue units
    with larger expansion capacity and the customers’ need to
    differentiate themselves by providing feature-rich multi-play
    services.

Chassis revenue units slightly increased from 2005 to 2006 due
    primarily to the sales of higher-end T-series and M-series
    products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a
    2005 acquisition, partially offset by decreases in sales of
    lower-end

E-series

and
    M-series products. Sales of higher-end chassis units increased
    as our customers continued to adopt and expand IP networks in
    order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer
    multiple services over a single network. Port shipment units
    increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the increase in
    port demands driven by the larger expansion capacity in the
    higher-end chassis revenue units shipped during 2006, partially
    offset by the lower port capacity in the CTP-series chassis
    revenue units.

SLT
    Product Revenues

SLT product revenues accounted for 20.2% of total net revenues
    and increased $93.9 million, or 20%, to $573.8 million
    in 2007, compared to 2006. The revenue increase was due to sales
    increases across the majority of the SLT product families
    particularly the Firewall, SSL, WAN Optimization and J-series
    products. Our customers’



demands for SLT products grew due to their increasing focus on
    addressing the risks associated with connecting and delivering
    critical network services and business applications. The
    integrated systems introduced prior to 2007, such as the ISG and
    SSG firewall products, gained traction in the market place and
    generated additional revenue in 2007. The revenue increase from
    our SSL products was due to our deployments of SSL solutions to
    enterprises and governments who were seeking to enhance their
    remote access to data and applications. We experienced
    considerable improvement in revenue from our WAN Optimization
    application acceleration platforms as customers sought to boost
    the responsiveness of their networks. All three geographic
    regions had significant growth in SLT sales during 2007. We
    experienced a growing demand for our SLT products in both the
    enterprise and service provider markets as we focused on
    cross-selling more integrated products and solutions in the
    enterprise and service provider markets while leveraging
    partnerships with open standards based interoperability of our
    SLT products. In addition, we benefited from typical
    fourth-quarter seasonality. We generally experienced seasonality
    and fluctuations in the demand for our SLT products, which may
    result in greater variations in our quarterly revenue.

In January 2008, we announced a plan to phase out our DX product
    line. These products will be supported until 2013. We do not
    expect this plan to have a material impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

SLT products accounted for $479.9 million, or 20.8%, of our
    total net revenues in 2006 and $399.4 million, or 19.3%, of
    total net revenues during 2005. SLT product net revenue
    increased $80.5 million, or 20%, from 2005 to 2006 due to a
    growing demand and brand recognition for our SLT products from
    large enterprises and the U.S. Federal Government. Sales
    increased across various SLT product families including
    Firewalls, IDP, J-series, DX, and SSL. In addition, the new
    products announced in 2006 and the DX and application
    acceleration products added to our portfolio through the various
    acquisitions in 2005 contributed to this increase. In addition,
    we experienced success in cross-selling SLT products to service
    providers for both their own IT infrastructure and resale built
    upon the acquisitions we completed in 2005. A further part of
    the increase was due to successfully selling to much larger
    enterprise customers with increased footprint and complexity.

SLT product units increased in 2007 as compared to 2006
    primarily attributable to the growing demand for our SLT
    products in the market place. The 30% increase in the number of
    SLT units was greater than the revenue increase of 20% primarily
    due to the increased revenue from sales of our branch firewall
    products, which have lower average selling price than other SLT
    products. SLT product units increased 8% while SLT product
    revenue increased 20% in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due
    to sales of high-end firewalls.

Net
    Service Revenues

Net service revenues increased $98.8 million, or 24%, to
    $509.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006, and represent
    18.0% of net revenues. The growth in service revenue was
    primarily driven by increased technical support service
    contracts associated with higher Infrastructure and SLT product
    sales, which have resulted in increased renewals and a larger
    installed base of equipment being serviced. Installed base is
    calculated by each customer based on the number of systems that
    the customers has under maintenance. A majority of our service
    revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and
    enter into maintenance contracts that are generally for one-year
    renewable periods. We also have multi-year maintenance
    contracts. These contracts are typically for services such as

24-hour

customer support, non-specified updates and hardware repairs. We
    recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are
    completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. In
    addition to support services and professional services, we also
    provide educational services. Consistent with 2006, support
    service revenues represents 89% of net service revenues in 2007.
    To a lesser extent, professional services also contributed to
    the growth in net service revenues in 2007. Professional service
    revenue increased primarily due to large customer deployments
    requiring consulting services.



Net service revenues increased $117.3 million, or 40%, from
    2005 to 2006 primarily due to the growth in support services
    driven by an increase in the installed base that we are
    servicing, as well as increased attach rates on new product
    sales, improved enterprise service infrastructure allowing more
    rapid implementation of services and the addition of new
    professional service offerings. Professional service revenue
    also increased, to a lesser extent, in 2006 compared to 2005 due
    primarily to maintenance-related

on-site

engineering services as well as additional consulting projects
    in 2006.

Prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the
    current period presentation.

We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among
    our three geographic regions for the three years ended
    December 31, 2007 and we expect this trend to continue.

Net revenues in the Americas region increased
    $307.2 million, or 30%, to $1,340.5 million in 2007 as
    compared to 2006. The Americas region represented 47.3% of net
    revenues in 2007, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over
    2006. The increases were largely due to strength in the United
    States and in Latin America. Net revenue from the United States
    increased $265.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily due to revenue growth in the Infrastructure product
    segment from our service provider and internet content provider
    customers and, to a lesser extent, SLT product and Service
    segments. Net revenues from Latin America increased
    $39.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to
    strength in Brazil driven by sales to a major local carrier.
    Total 2006 revenue recorded by the Americas region grew by
    $100.4 million from its 2005 level and remained at
    approximately 45% of worldwide revenue, as compared to 2005, due
    to significant success in the United States and with the main
    service providers in Canada and various South American countries
    including Brazil and Argentina. Net revenue in the United States
    increased by $71.3 million in 2006 from 2005 due to
    continued success both with enterprise customers such as the
    U.S. Federal Government, as well as with major service
    providers in the United States. The increase was also due in
    part to sales to major internet content providers and cable
    providers. This success was partially offset by a significant
    product revenue deferral for products shipped to one of our
    largest customers. Net revenue in Americas as a percentage of
    total net revenue decreased slightly in 2006 compared to 2005 as
    a result of the strong growth in EMEA.

Net revenue in the EMEA region increased $100.6 million, or
    12%, to $918.0 million in 2007, compared to 2006, due to
    increased Infrastructure product and SLT product revenues along
    with increased service revenue driven by strong bandwidth
    demands in the region. Revenue increased in Belgium, Ireland,
    United Kingdom, and France,



partially offset by a decrease in the Netherlands as well as
    revenue growth in the emerging markets such as Eastern Europe
    and the Middle East. Net revenue from EMEA as a percentage of
    net revenues decreased 3.1 percentage points to 32.4% in
    2007 over 2006 primarily due to relative strength in the
    Americas region. Revenue in the EMEA region grew by
    $207.3 million, or 34%, in 2006, compared to 2005, due to
    significant success with NGN deployments across the region, in
    particular Sweden, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, as well
    as sales growth in emerging regions including Russia, Eastern
    Europe and the Middle East. As a result, net revenue from EMEA
    as a percentage of net revenues increased 5.9 percentage
    points to 35.5% in 2006 over 2005.

Net revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased
    $124.7 million, or 28%, to $577.6 million in 2007,
    compared to 2006, due to increased revenue from Infrastructure
    products, SLT products and Service driven by demands from
    service providers as well as enterprise customers resulting from
    cross-selling of our product portfolio. We experienced revenue
    growth across the region with strength in Korea, Australia,
    Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Revenue from the Asia Pacific
    region declined $68.1 million, or 13%, in 2006 as compared
    to 2005 primarily due to the impact of certain NGN project
    decision delays in Japan driving revenue down year over year,
    partially offset by increased demands in China.

NSN accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and
    service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006, and 2005. We expect that our largest customers, as well as
    key strategic partners, will continue to account for a
    substantial portion of our net revenues in 2008.

Cost of
    Product Revenues

Product gross margin improved from 70.7% in 2006 to 70.9% in
    2007. The slight increase in product gross margin was mainly due
    to favorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, improvements
    in standard costs of our Infrastructure products, partially
    offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product gross margin. The
    improvement of standard costs as a percentage of product revenue
    was primarily due to our increased purchases from contract
    manufacturers and suppliers in lower cost regions. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, we employed 190 and
    149 people, respectively, in our manufacturing and
    operations organization. These personnel manage relationships
    with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and
    monitor product testing and quality.

Infrastructure product gross margin percentages improved
    slightly in 2007 compared to 2006. Our Infrastructure chassis
    revenue units increased 10% while our Infrastructure ports
    shipped increased 41% during 2007, on a

year-over-year

basis, compared to the Infrastructure product revenues increase
    of 24% for the year. We experienced a favorable product mix and
    derived a larger portion of revenues from richly configured
    high-end M-series and T-series router products. We also
    generated revenues from high-margin port shipments, which are
    add-on components to the chassis routers. The increases in
    chassis units and port shipments were driven by bandwidth demand
    as customers are seeking to expand capabilities in their
    networks and to offer differentiating feature-rich multi-play
    services that allow them to generate new revenue sources. See
    further details in the “Infrastructure Product
    Revenues” section.



The gross margin improvement from Infrastructure products was
    offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product gross margin in
    2007. The decrease in SLT product gross margin was primarily due
    to product mix, particularly from an increase in the mix of
    lower margin branch Firewall and J-series products in 2007. In
    addition, higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and
    more complex products were also impacting SLT gross margin. The
    higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized
    the benefit of our cost-reduction efforts of moving more
    manufacturing to lower cost regions. See further details in the
    “SLT Product Revenues” section.

Cost of product revenues increased $48.8 million, or 10%,
    in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily
    attributable to increased product revenue in both the enterprise
    and service provider markets. Net product gross margin of 70.7%
    for 2006 slightly decreased, compared to 71.4% for 2005,
    primarily due to the impact of the mix of products and the mix
    of territories, partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs.
    As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we employed 149 and
    134 people, respectively, in our manufacturing and
    operations organization. The increase in stock compensation
    expense in cost of product revenue from 2005 to 2006 of
    $0.9 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting
    FAS 123R on January 1, 2006.

Product gross margins tend to fluctuate due to changes in the
    mix of products sold and our gross margins may be impacted as we
    introduce new products and manage production costs among
    multiple contract manufacturers or when our customers change the
    timing of their purchases. We will continue to seek reductions
    in our production costs as we enter into new markets, including
    markets with different pricing structures and cost structures.
    Our margins are impacted by changes in distribution channels and
    price competition as well as changes in the geographic mix of
    our sales. Sales discounts, warranty costs, changes in shipment
    volume, loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing
    also impact gross margins. These factors, combined with how well
    we execute on our strategy and operating plans, may lead to
    margin variability.

Cost of
    Service Revenues

Cost of service revenues increased $52.2 million, or 26%,
    to $251.4 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Service
    gross margin decreased by less than one percentage point to
    50.6% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in service costs
    and the decrease in gross margin were primarily attributable to
    increases in headcount related expenses associated with
    expanding our service delivery infrastructure and professional
    service organization, particularly in North America and in
    India, as well as increasing our resources for supporting
    network build-outs and deployments by our customers. Service
    related headcount increased by 137 employees, or 22%, to
    748 employees in 2007, compared to 611 in 2006. Employee
    salary and related expenses, including stock-based compensation
    expense, represented the majority of the increases in cost of
    service revenues in 2007. Total employee salary and related
    expenses as a percentage of service revenues were approximately
    25% for 2007 and 20% for 2006. Outside service expense increased
    as we used outside providers to support the increase in customer
    support contracts and professional engagements. Freight related
    expense increased due to the deployment of spare parts in
    supporting our growth overseas. Facility and IT expenses
    allocation to the cost of service revenues increased in 2007,
    which is consistent with other areas of our organization, due to
    our headcount growth and investment in internal infrastructure
    to support our growing business. Partially offsetting the
    increases was a decrease in spares expense due to the large
    spares purchase we made in 2006.

Cost of service revenues increased $52.0 million, or 35%,
    to $199.2 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase
    was a direct result of a larger installed base of products
    covered by service contracts. However, our service gross margin
    increased one percentage point from 2005 to 2006 as a result of
    improved efficiencies and economies of scale, which result in a
    better leveraged service organization. Total employee salary and
    related expenses as a percentage of service revenue were
    approximately 20% for 2006 and 20% for 2005; however, in
    absolute dollars, employee salary and related expenses increased
    from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an investment in new customer
    service personnel, particularly to support our enterprise
    customers. Stock compensation expense in cost of service revenue
    also increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the impact of
    adopting FAS 123R in 2006. In addition to personnel
    expenses, outside services costs increased from 2005 to 2006
    primarily due to contracting for engineers to provide
    professional services revenue, particularly for the Middle East
    and other emerging markets. Spares and freight costs increased
    from 2005 to 2006 due to a significant investment in spares
    around the world to support the increase in customer contracts,
    particularly in the enterprise market. Finally, the costs
    associated with facilities,



depreciation and other expenses allocated to cost of service
    revenue increased from 2005 to 2006 due to increases in revenue
    and investment in infrastructure to support the growing business.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses include:

•

the costs of developing our products from components to
    prototypes to finished products,

•

the costs for outside services such as certifications of new
    products, and

•

expenditures associated with equipment used for testing.

Several components of our research and development effort
    require significant expenditures, such as the development of new
    components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing
    of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We
    expense our research and development costs as they are incurred.

Research and development expense increased $142.7 million,
    or 30%, and increased 1.2 percentage points of net revenues
    in 2007 over 2006. The increase was largely due to our
    commitment to continue innovation of our



products. In particular in 2007, we continued the development of
    our Ethernet products, including the MX-series and our new
    EX-series Ethernet switching products introduced in January
    2008, as well as the development of our new T1600 product, which
    was released in November 2007. Personnel related expenses, which
    comprise the majority of our research and development expenses,
    increased primarily due to headcount growth and merit-based
    salary increases in 2007. Research and development related
    headcount increased by 493 employees, or 24%, in 2007 to
    2,563 employees as of December 31, 2007. Headcount
    increase was primarily due to additional hires in the
    engineering organization within the Infrastructure segment. In
    addition to personnel related expenses, we also increased
    prototype and lab equipment expenses in 2007 for the development
    of our new products. Additionally our allocated facilities and
    information technology, as well as depreciation expenses, for
    our research and development organization increased in 2007 due
    to increases in headcount from additional internal systems to
    support our growth. In general, we grew our engineering
    organizations to support product innovation, expand and improve
    our product portfolio and address growth opportunities in NGN
    bandwidth and features for our service provider and enterprise
    customers.

Research and development expenses increased $123.0 million,
    or 3.5 percentage points of net revenues, in 2006 over 2005
    as a result of our focus on the development of a broader
    portfolio of networking products. The increase in absolute
    dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related
    expenses, depreciation, facility related expenses, engineering
    and testing expenses, outside service expenses and equipment
    related expenses. The increases in personnel related expenses in
    2006 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering
    organization across the Infrastructure and SLT segments.
    Headcount increased 19% from 1,736 individuals to 2,070
    individuals during 2006. The headcount increase was attributable
    to product innovation efforts in areas including router security
    and integration in order to capture potential future NGN
    infrastructure growth and other opportunities in the enterprise
    and the service provider markets. To a lesser extent, the
    increases in personnel expenses were attributable to merit-based
    salary increases beginning in April 2006. Facility, engineering
    and testing expense increased in 2006 to support our product
    innovation efforts. Outside service expenses increased in 2006
    primarily due to additional consulting projects on developing
    future product roadmaps. The increase in stock compensation
    expense in research and development expenses from 2005 to 2006
    of $24.0 million was primarily due to the impact of
    adopting FAS 123R in 2006. Our investment and expansion on
    our global research and development efforts were primarily in
    China and India.

We plan to increase our investment in research and development
    during 2008, compared to 2007, to further advance our
    competitive advantage. As a percentage of net revenues, we
    anticipate our research and development spending will decrease
    slightly in 2008.

Sales and
    Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our
    products and services, demonstration equipment and
    advertisements. These costs vary

quarter-to-quarter

depending on revenues, product launches and marketing
    initiatives. We have an extensive distribution channel in place
    that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have
    made substantial investments in our distribution channel during
    2007, 2006 and 2005.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $108.7 million, or
    19%, to $666.7 million and represented 23.5% of total net
    revenues in 2007, compared to 24.2% in 2006. As a percentage of
    net revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in
    2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin and the
    efficiency of our sales activities. The increases in absolute
    dollars were primarily headcount related increases. Sales and
    marketing related headcount increased 272 employees, or
    17%, in 2007 to 1,863 as of December 31, 2007 as we hired
    additional personnel across our Infrastructure and SLT
    organizations to support the larger product portfolio and to
    expand our presence in the enterprise marketplace. In addition,
    commission expenses increased primarily as a result of strong
    revenue growth. In 2007, we also increased consulting expenses
    to support our sales and marketing initiatives. Likewise our
    need and expenses for demonstration equipment has grown as we
    seek to capture new markets and release new products. As the
    sales and marketing organization grows, we have also grown our
    information technology and facilities to these organizations,
    accounting for the increases of related expense allocations in
    2007 over 2006.



Sales and marketing expenses increased $116.4 million, or
    26%, to $558.0 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and
    increased as a percent of total net revenues. The increases were
    primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses,
    facility related expenses, travel expenses, marketing related
    activities, and equipment related expenses. Personnel related
    expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional hires to
    support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer
    base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. In
    particular, we expanded our enterprise sales force, and targeted
    key growth areas such as China, the Middle East and India. We
    added 171 individuals to our sales and marketing function during
    2006. Travel expense increased in 2006 due primarily to
    increased headcount and more activity in emerging markets.
    Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of
    specific activities designed to expand and improve our brand
    recognition, support of our distribution channels, introduction
    of new products, targeted solution value propositions and
    increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range
    of customers. Equipment related expenses increased in 2006 due
    to the introduction of new products. The increase in stock
    compensation expenses in sales and marketing from 2005 to 2006
    of $24.5 million was primarily due to the impact of
    adopting FAS 123R in 2006.

We plan to continue our investment in sales and marketing
    activities in both direct and channel sales as well as our
    service provider and enterprise focus. We anticipate our sales
    and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars but
    decrease as a percentage of net revenues in 2008.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses include professional fees,
    bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional
    fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate
    strategic services.

General and administrative expenses increased
    $19.3 million, or 20%, and represented 4.1% of total net
    revenues in 2007, compared to 4.2% in 2006. As a percentage of
    net revenue, general and administrative expenses slightly
    decreased in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating
    margin. The increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to
    increases in personnel related expenses and outside professional
    services. Employee related expenses, including salaries,
    bonuses, stock-based compensation, and fringe benefits expenses,
    increased in 2007 over 2006, as headcount increased by
    56 employees, or 24%, in 2007 to 291 employees as of
    December 31, 2007. The headcount increases were primarily
    in the finance and human resources organizations as we expanded
    our organization infrastructure in lower cost regions, improved
    internal processes and continued our initiatives to update our
    information systems. Outside services increased
    $4.5 million in 2007, compared to 2006, as we invested in
    designing a more efficient organizational structure and
    improving our internal systems. Such increases were offset by
    the decreases in accounting and legal fees of $1.5 million
    for 2007, compared to 2006. Consistent with other areas of our
    organization, facilities and information technology allocations
    increased in order to support these initiatives and the growth
    of our business.

General and administrative expenses increased
    $22.1 million, or 29%, in 2006 compared to 2005. As a
    percentage of net revenues, general and administrative expenses
    increased slightly from 3.6% in 2005 to 4.2% in 2006. The
    increases were driven by increases in personnel related expenses
    and other related expenses. General and administrative
    world-wide headcount increased 11%, or 24 individuals, during
    2006, to support the overall growth in the business. Bad debt
    expense increased in 2006 primarily due to a bad debt expense
    benefit in 2005. Facility and IT related allocation expense
    increased as a result of our personnel growth and development of
    our systems infrastructure. The increase of general and
    administrative related stock compensation expense from 2005 to
    2006 of $11.8 million was primarily due to the impact of
    adopting FAS 123R in 2006.

We anticipate our general and administrative expenses to
    increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of net
    revenues in 2008.

Amortization
    of Purchased Intangible Assets

Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased
    $5.9 million due to purchased intangible assets reaching
    the end of the amortization period during 2007 as compared to
    2006. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased
    $6.6 million in 2006, compared to 2005, as a result of
    recognizing a full year of amortization associated with the five
    acquisitions completed in 2005. See Note 3 in Item 8
    for more information on our purchased intangible assets.



Impairment
    of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

We had no impairment against our goodwill or intangible assets
    in 2007. Impairment charges increased by $1,277.5 million
    in 2006, compared to 2005, as a result of the impairment of both
    goodwill and purchased intangible assets during 2006. Due
    primarily to the decline in the Company’s market
    capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six
    months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent,
    to a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the
    income approach, we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill
    and reduced the goodwill within the SLT segment by
    $1,280.0 million. In addition, we recorded a
    $3.4 million impairment expense pertaining to a write-down
    of intangible assets as a result of a decrease in forecasted
    revenue for the SBC stand-alone products during the second
    quarter of 2006. In 2005, we wrote down $5.9 million of
    purchased intangible assets acquired from Kagoor Networks, Inc.
    (“Kagoor”). See Note 3 in Item 8 for more
    information on our impairment of goodwill and purchased
    intangible assets.

In-Process
    Research and Development

We had no in-process research and development
    (“IPR&D”) charges in 2007 and 2006. In 2005, a
    total of $11.0 million was charged to IPR&D expense in
    connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year.
    Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was
    allocated to IPR&D. Of the total Peribit purchase price,
    $3.8 million was allocated to IPR&D. Of the total
    Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to
    IPR&D. None of the Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc.
    (“Acorn”) or Redline Networks, Inc.
    (“Redline”) purchase prices were allocated to
    IPR&D.

Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have
    not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no
    alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as
    being equivalent to a beta-phase working prototype in which
    there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the
    time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, and Kagoor had multiple
    IPR&D efforts under way for certain current and future
    product lines.

•

For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for
    the Steel-Belted Radius (“SBR”), SBR High Availability
    (“HA”), and Mobile IP Module (“MIM”) II
    products — all related to the Radius product offering.
    IPR&D as of the acquisition date also included development
    of new versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control),
    and Odyssey product families. At the time of the Funk
    acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts
    would be completed over the next four months at an estimated
    cost of approximately $0.9 million. These development
    efforts had been completed as of December 31, 2007.

•

For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next
    versions of software for the Sequence Reducer (“SR”)
    family, Sequence Mirror (“SM”) family, the Central
    Management System (“CMS”) products, as well as a
    hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of
    the Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development
    efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an
    estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million. These
    development efforts had been completed as of December 31,
    2007.

•

For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling
    protocols and next generation products and operating systems. At
    the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these
    development efforts would be completed over the next eight
    months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.8 million.
    These development efforts had been completed as of
    December 31, 2007.

Other
    Charges, Net

Other charges are summarized as follows:

•

Restructuring and Acquisition Related
    Reserves.

In 2007, we recorded net restructuring
    and acquisition related charges of $0.7 million, of which
    $1.1 million pertained to bonus accruals associated with
    past acquisitions, partially offset by a benefit of
    $0.4 million pertaining to net restructuring adjustments.
    We recorded net restructuring and acquisition related bonus
    expenses of $5.9 million in 2006, of which
    $5.6 million was due to bonus accruals associated with the
    Funk and Acorn acquisitions and $0.3 million was due to net
    restructuring related charges, including $0.7 million in
    restructuring charges associated with



the initiation of a restructuring plan which focused on some
    product development costs reductions and the discontinuation of
    our SBC product. The $6.5 million restructuring and
    acquisition related benefit in 2005 primarily consisted of
    $6.9 million in adjustments related to our restructuring
    accrual when we re-occupied a portion of the former NetScreen
    facility that was previously included in this acquisition
    related restructuring reserve, partially offset by a
    $0.3 million bonus and earn-out accrual related to the Funk
    and Acorn acquisitions.

•

Stock Option Investigation Costs.

We recorded
    expenses of $6.0 million and $20.5 million in 2007 and
    2006, respectively, relating to professional fees and other
    costs in connection with our stock option investigation. There
    were no such charges in 2005.

•

Stock Option Amendment and Tax Related
    Charges.

We recorded $8.0 million and
    $10.1 million in operating expense during 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, in relation to the amendment of stock options and
    to the payment of certain taxes and penalties associated with
    stock option exercises by employees. There were no such charges
    in 2005.

•

Net Settlement Gain.

We recognized a net legal
    settlement gain of $5.3 million in 2007 in connection with
    cash settlement proceeds of $6.2 million, net of the
    $0.9 million legal expense related to direct transaction
    costs incurred in the third quarter of 2007.

Interest
    and Other Income, Net

Net interest and other income decreased $3.9 million, or
    4%, in 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease was due to decreases
    in interest income resulting from a lower cash, cash equivalents
    and investment balance attributable to our funding of our
    repurchase of approximately $1.6 billion of our common
    stock during the first and second quarters of 2007. Partially
    offsetting the decreases was the higher interest yield combined
    with a higher average cash, cash equivalents and investment
    balances particularly in the beginning of 2007, primarily due to
    higher positive cash flows from operations compared to 2006.
    Interest and other expenses slightly increased in 2007 compared
    to 2006, primarily due to costs associated with our distributor
    financing program. Other interest and expenses include
    short-term debt expenses, debt issuance cost amortization,
    foreign exchange losses and other expenses such as bank fees.

Net interest and other income increased $45.5 million in
    2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a $45.8 million
    increase in interest income from 2005 to 2006 as a result of
    higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances and an
    increase in rates of return realized from our investments
    throughout 2006. Also, interest and other expense decreased
    $0.3 million from 2005 and 2006 primarily due to lower
    portfolio management fees.



Gain on
    and (Write-Down of) Investments, Net

In June 2007, one of the companies in which we had a minority
    equity investment completed an initial public offering
    (“IPO”). As a result, we realized a gain of
    $6.7 million during 2007 based upon the difference between
    the market value of our investment at the time of the IPO and
    our cost basis. During 2006, none of our investments had any
    gain or loss. In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million
    in connection with a business combination transaction of a
    privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost
    basis of this equity investment was $1.0 million. We have
    certain minority equity investments in privately held companies
    that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do
    not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to
    exercise significant influence over these companies. In
    addition, during 2005, we wrote-down these investments by
    $0.4 million for changes in market value that we believed
    were

other-than-temporary.

Income
    Tax Provision

Provision for income taxes increased to $149.8 million in
    2007 from $104.4 million in 2006. The 2007 effective rate
    was 29.3% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0%
    primarily due to the benefit of income in foreign jurisdictions
    which is subject to lower rates and research and development
    credits in the United States.

Provision for income taxes decreased to $104.4 million in
    2006 from $146.8 million in 2005. The 2006 effective rate
    was (11.6%) and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0%
    primarily due to the inability to benefit from a substantial
    portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006. The
    2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal
    statutory rate of 35.0% due primarily to the benefit of tax
    credits, income in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates
    and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the
    repatriation in 2005 of $225.0 million under the American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

The gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by approximately
    $9.5 million for 2007, of which $8.4 million, if
    recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Interest and
    penalties accrued for the same period were approximately
    $1.7 million.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next
    12 months due to audit examinations. However, an estimate
    of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time due
    to the high uncertainty of the resolution of

and/or

closure on open audits.

We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2004 tax
    year and by the German tax authorities for the 2005 tax year.
    Additionally, we have not reached a final resolution with the
    IRS on an adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax
    years. We are not under examination by any other major
    jurisdictions in which the Company files its income tax returns
    as of December 31, 2007. It is possible that the amount of
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within
    the next 12 months. However, an estimate of the range of
    possible change cannot be made at this time. We have provided
    for uncertain tax positions that require a FIN 48 liability.

Additional details related to our income tax provision can be
    found in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Segment
    Information

A description of the products and services for each segment can
    be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. We began to track financial information by our three
    segments in 2005 as our management structure and
    responsibilities began to measure the business based on
    management operating income (loss). A description of the
    measures included in management operating income (loss) can also
    be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. We have included segment financial data for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 for
    comparative purposes.

Infrastructure
    Operating Segment

An analysis of the change in revenue for the Infrastructure
    segment, and the change in units, can be found above in the
    section titled “Net Revenues.”

Infrastructure management operating income increased
    $74.6 million, or 18%, from 2006 to $495.5 million in
    2007 due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth. Our
    increase in revenue was partially offset by our continued
    investments in research and development efforts as we seek to
    continue our innovation of products and expand our
    Infrastructure product portfolio. We also allocate sales and
    marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and
    information technology expenses to the Infrastructure segment
    generally based on headcount and revenue. In 2007, our sales and
    marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net
    revenues but increased in absolute dollars as we increased our
    efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers. We
    will continue to make these investments to expand our product
    features and functionality based upon the trends in the market
    place.

Infrastructure management operating income decreased
    $68.3 million, or 14%, from 2005 to $420.9 million in
    2006 primarily due to higher personnel related costs associated
    with our investments in product innovation for next generation
    core and edge infrastructure products as well as increased
    operating expenses associated with marketing related efforts and
    improvements to our internal infrastructure, partially offset by
    savings in sales expense during 2006 as we increasingly
    leveraged our existing distribution channel.

SLT
    Operating Segment

An analysis of the change in revenue for the SLT segment, and
    the change in units, can be found in the section titled
    “Net Revenues.”



SLT management operating loss increased $7.0 million, or
    62%, from 2006 to $18.3 million in 2007 due to product mix
    and increases in manufacturing related costs. The loss was
    primarily due to our effort to build a foundation to help enable
    future SLT revenue growth and due to slight decreases in the SLT
    product gross margins. The increase in SLT operating expenses
    was due in large part to our increased allocated expenses to the
    SLT segment from both information technology investments and the
    higher variable compensation expenses associated with
    company-wide revenue growth. Additionally, we strategically
    invested in our research and development efforts to develop
    technologies and products for the JUNOS platform. In an effort
    to control costs, we have moved a significant portion of the SLT
    development organization to lower cost regions while expanding
    our product portfolio. SLT management operating loss was also
    impacted by continued investments in our sales and distribution
    channels. We allocate sales and marketing, general and
    administrative, as well as facility and information technology
    expenses to the SLT segment generally based on revenue and
    headcount. In the third quarter of 2007, we increased our
    allocation of such expenses to the SLT segment, compared to the
    same period in 2006, primarily due to information technology
    investments and the higher variable compensation expenses
    associated with company-wide revenue increases. SLT gross margin
    decreased slightly in 2007, as compared to 2006, due to higher
    manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex
    products. Such higher manufacturing costs were partially offset
    as we realized the benefit of our cost-reduction efforts of
    moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions. The increases
    in SLT operating expenses were partially offset by our revenue
    growth especially in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to
    customers’ demands for security products, particularly
    Firewall, and due to typical quarterly seasonality. We generally
    experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand
    for our SLT products, particularly in the fourth quarter, which
    may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating
    results.

The SLT segment incurred a management operating loss of
    $11.3 million in 2006, compared to the management operating
    income of $10.4 million in 2005, due primarily to higher
    product and personnel related costs, partially offset by higher
    SLT net revenues and gross margin. Increases in personnel
    related costs were primarily related to headcount growth in
    order to support product innovation, new products sales and a
    larger customer base. We made a strategic decision to invest
    more into the enterprise and SLT markets to drive increased
    revenues and SLT productivity in the future.

Service
    Operating Segment

An analysis of the change in revenue for the Service segment can
    be found above in the section titled “Net Revenue.”

Service management operating income increased
    $24.9 million, or 25%, from 2006 to $126.4 million in
    2007 by achieving economies of scale and cost control
    initiatives. Revenue growth surpassed cost of service expense
    growth in 2007 primarily due to our growth in installed base of
    equipment being serviced. We also increased our service
    offerings and customer service infrastructure. Our Service gross
    margin slightly decreased from 2006 to 2007 as we increased our
    headcount to build our global customer service and professional
    service organizations. We expanded our customer service center
    in both North America and India as well as increased our
    resources for supporting network build-outs and deployments by
    our customers. Service management operating income was also
    impacted by sales and marketing, general and administrative
    expenses as well as facilities and information systems
    management allocations to the service segment.

Service gross margin percentages as well as Service management
    operating income increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to
    improved economies of scale achieved by faster revenue growth
    through the Infrastructure products and the SLT products
    relative to the increases in operating costs. In absolute
    dollars, employee related expenses increased in 2006 as a result
    of increased service related headcount from 476 to 611
    individuals. Expenses associated with spare components also
    increased in 2006 to support increased demands driven by
    additional service contracts as a result of our growing
    installed base.

Stock-Based
    Compensation and Related Payroll Taxes

Stock-based compensation expense increased by $0.4 million
    in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase was primarily
    attributable to new stock options and RSU grants, partially
    offset by the lower stock option expense in 2007 as a result of
    the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and

“out-of-the-money”

stock options



completed in December 2005 (“2005 stock option vesting
    acceleration”). Stock-based compensation related payroll
    tax expense increased $5.0 million in 2007. These expenses
    represent employment taxes we incurred in connection with our
    employee stock programs. Changes in such expenses are primarily
    attributable to the timing of the stock options exercises by our
    employees. We experienced a considerable increase in these
    expenses due to the increase in our share price occurring in
    2007. In contrast, we had restrictions on stock option exercises
    during 2006.

Stock-based compensation expense increased by $65.3 million
    in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the adoption of
    FAS 123R. Stock-based compensation related payroll tax
    expense decreased $0.2 million in 2006, compared to 2005
    primarily due to restrictions on stock option exercises in 2006
    as a result of our delayed periodic filings with the SEC.

In-Process
    Research and Development

There were no IPR&D charges in 2007 and 2006. We recognized
    IPR&D charges of $11.0 million 2005 in connection with
    the acquisitions completed during the year.

Restructuring
    Charges in Cost of Product Revenues

There was no restructuring charges included in cost of product
    revenues during 2007 and 2005. We recognized restructuring
    charges in cost of product revenues of $1.4 million for
    2006 in connection with the restructuring plan implemented
    during the year.

    Intangible Assets, Other Expense, Gain on Investments, and Net
    Interest and Other Income

See “Results of Operations” section for further
    information.

Key
    Performance Measures

In addition to the financial metrics included in the
    consolidated financial statements, we use the following key
    performance measures to assess operating results:

Years Ended December 31,




Days sales outstanding (DSO)(a)




Book-to-bill

ratio(b)

>1

>1

<1

(a)

Days sales outstanding, or DSO, is calculated as the ratio of
    ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by
    average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days.

(b)

Book-to-bill

ratio represents the ratio of customer orders divided by the sum
    of product shipments and service invoicing during the respective
    period.

The significant components of our working capital are cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts
    receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities,
    debt and deferred revenue.

Working capital decreased $583.9 million from
    December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 primarily due
    to the decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and

available-for-sale

investments balance in the first and second quarters of 2007.
    Our total cash, cash equivalents, and

available-for-sale

investments decreased by $598.5 million during 2007
    primarily due to stock repurchases under the 2006 Stock
    Repurchase Program discussed below. Additionally, because the
    debt related to our outstanding zero-coupon convertible notes is
    due within one year, we reclassified $399.5 million of debt
    underlying such notes from long-term to short-term liabilities
    and, as a result, further reduced our working capital. In 2007,
    we generated $786.5 million of cash from operations and
    $571.8 million from our investing activities. In addition,
    we received financing cash flows of $355.0 million from
    common stock issued to our employees through stock option
    exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases. In 2007,
    we repurchased 69.4 million shares of our common stock for
    $1,623.2 million at an average purchase price of $23.37 per
    share. As of December 31, 2007, our 2006 Stock Repurchase
    Program had remaining authorized funds of $376.8 million.
    We may repurchase additional shares opportunistically under this
    program, subject to a review of circumstances at the time. See
    Note 15 in Item 8 for discussion of our stock
    repurchase activity in 2008.

In June 2007, we entered into a senior secured margin lending
    agreement with a third-party financial institution for a maximum
    credit facility of $400.0 million, or 90% of the fair
    market value of the underlying collateral, to establish a
    flexible draw down facility to fund additional stock
    repurchases, as necessary. This credit facility bore a floating
    interest rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus
    40 basis points per annum and, if utilized, would be
    secured by our publicly traded fixed income securities portfolio
    equivalent to 111% of any outstanding balance. This credit
    facility was terminated on September 26, 2007. We did not
    utilize this credit facility at any time.

Net accounts receivable increased $130.3 million, or 52%,
    to $379.8 million from December 31, 2006 to
    December 31, 2007 primarily due to an increase in revenue
    and shipment linearity. DSO was 42 days as of
    December 31, 2007 as compared to 38 days as of
    December 31, 2006. The increase in DSO was primarily a
    result of shipment linearity and the mix of customers we shipped
    to in the fourth quarter of 2007. Shipment linearity represents
    the rate at which products are shipped during a period. Our
    distributor financing program had minimal impact on DSO during
    2007. Approximately $10.0 million of receivables sold under
    the distributor financing program had not been recognized in net
    revenues as of December 31, 2007 and therefore such amounts
    were recorded as debt financing in other accrued liabilities.

Deferred revenue increased $127.7 million or 33% to
    $513.3 million as of December 31, 2007 as compared to
    December 31, 2006. Product and service deferred revenue
    increased $43.2 million and $84.5 million,
    respectively, in 2007. Our product deferred revenue increased
    due to increases in the amount of product shipments not having
    met revenue recognition criteria and service deferred revenue
    increased due to an increase in the installed base of equipment
    under service contract.



Liquidity and capital resources may also be impacted by
    acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may
    make in the networking equipment and information security
    markets. If we were to repurchase additional shares of our
    common stock under our 2006 Stock Repurchase Program, our
    liquidity may be impacted. Additionally, a portion of our cash
    and investment balance is held overseas and may be subject to
    U.S. taxes if repatriated.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe
    that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
    long-term investments, together with cash generated from
    operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of
    employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock
    purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations,
    repayment of outstanding debt, and growth. We believe our
    working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements
    for capital expenditures, commitments, repurchases of our common
    stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with our
    existing operations through at least the next 12 months.

However, our future capital requirements may vary materially
    from those now planned depending on many factors, including:

•

the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit
    margins;

•

our business, product, capital expenditure and research and
    development plans;

•

the market acceptance of our products;

•

repurchases of our common stock;

•

issuance and repayment of debt;

•

litigation expenses, settlements and judgments;

•

volume price discounts and customer rebates;

•

the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain;

•

acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or
    technologies;

•

changes in our compensation policies;

•

capital improvements for new and existing facilities;

•

technological advances;

•

our competitors’ responses to our products;

•

our relationships with suppliers and customers;

•

expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any;

•

tax expense associated with stock-based awards;

•

issuance of stock-based awards and the related payment in cash
    for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during
    future years;

•

the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases
    under our equity incentive plans; and

•

general economic conditions and specific conditions in our
    industry and markets, including the effects of international
    conflicts and related uncertainties.

Cash
    Requirements and Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations
    outstanding under the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
    June 15, 2008 (“Senior Notes”), operating leases,
    purchase commitments, tax liabilities and other contractual
    obligations. The following table summarizes our principal

Summary
    of Cash Flows

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $786.5 million, $755.6 million, and
    $642.9 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to
    our net income (loss) adjusted by:

•

Non-cash charges of $257.5 million, $1,536.4 million,
    and $307.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
    primarily related to depreciation and amortization expenses,
    stock-based compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option
    plans, in-process research and development from acquisitions,
    debt issuance costs, restructuring expense, and impairment
    charges. Non-cash charges in 2007 and 2006 were reduced by the
    excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation of
    $19.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, and a
    gain on a minority equity investment of $6.7 million.

Non-cash charges in 2006 also included charges of
    $1,283.4 million related to the impairment of goodwill and
    intangible assets. In 2005 non-cash charges included
    $128.1 million of tax benefit from employee stock options.
    Beginning in 2006, tax benefit from employee stock options, in
    accordance with FAS 123R, are no longer included in cash
    flows from operations but rather are included in financing
    activities. Non-cash charges in 2005 also included an in-process
    research and development charge, a benefit from the reversal of
    NetScreen’s acquisition related liabilities and a loss due
    to the impairment of an equity investment, partially offset by
    gains associated with

available-for-sale

investments.

•

Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of
    $168.2 million, $220.6 million, and
    $(15.1) million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were
    generally generated in the normal course of business. These
    changes are highlighted as follows:

•

Net cash increases in 2007 were primarily attributable to
    increases in accounts payable of $34.9 million, an increase
    in accrued compensation of $48.3 million, an increase in
    taxes payable of $71.4 million and an increase in deferred
    revenue of $127.7 million. The increase in accounts payable
    was due to the timing of payments to contract manufacturers and
    the growth of our business. The increase in accrued compensation
    was due to an increase in headcount, an increase in stock option
    exercises and the removal of the suspension on employee
    purchases of shares under ESPP. The increase in taxes payable
    was due to the increase in the tax provision, movement of
    deferred tax assets, and timing of payments. The increase in
    deferred revenue was due to the growing installed base and
    customer payments in advance of product acceptance. In addition,
    these increases in cash flows from operations were partially
    offset by a negative cash flow of $120.9 million primarily
    due to an increase in net accounts receivable in 2007, which was
    primarily due to the timing of shipments and the mix of
    customers who purchased our products, as we shipped a larger
    amount of products late in the fourth quarter of 2007 and such
    invoices would not come due until after December 31, 2007.

•

Net cash increases in 2006 were primarily attributable to
    increases in deferred revenue of $132.8 million due to the
    growing installed base and customer payments in advance of
    product acceptance. The increase in operating cash flows was
    also due to the decreases in accounts receivable of
    $20.7 million and aggregate decreases in prepaid expenses,
    other current assets and other long-term assets of
    $23.0 million. Accounts payable increased
    $13.6 million and accrued compensation increased
    $12.7 million primarily due to the costs of headcount
    increases and related employee bonuses. Changes in taxes payable
    and other accrued liabilities contributed $18.3 million to
    cash flows from operations in 2006.

•

Net cash used in 2005 from changes was primarily attributable to
    increases in net accounts receivable of $68.1 million and
    decreases in other accrued liabilities of $100.7 million
    and accrued warranty of $3.7 million, partially offset by
    decreases in the prepaid expenses, other current assets and
    other long-term assets accounts of $5.3 million, increases
    in income taxes payable of $26.6 million, increases in
    deferred revenue of $64.3 million, increases in accounts
    payable of $50.3 million and increases in accrued
    compensation of $10.9 million.



Investing
    Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities was
    $571.8 million and $11.9 million for 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was
    $583.7 million for 2005. Investing activities primarily
    included the purchases and sale or maturities of

available-for-sale

securities, the purchase and sale of equity investments, net
    cash used in acquisitions and capital expenditures.

Net sales and maturities of investments in

available-for-sale

securities were $1,029.1 million in 2007, compared to net
    sales and maturities of $632.1 million for 2006, as we used
    cash to fund our stock repurchase program described under the
    financing activities section below. Purchases of

available-for-sale

securities used $298.6 million in 2007 compared to
    $516.1 million in 2006 primarily due to the funding of our
    stock repurchase program and our investment strategy during
    2007. Positive net cash flows of $115.9 million generated
    from the sales, maturities and purchases of

available-for-sale

securities in 2006 was primarily due to the increased cash and
    cash equivalent holdings as a result of higher short-term
    interest rates. Purchases and sales or maturities of

available-for-sale

securities used net cash of $131.0 million in 2005.

Capital expenditures increased $44.8 million to
    $146.9 million in 2007 and $3.9 million to
    $102.1 million in 2006 mainly to support new product
    developments and overseas expansions. Capital expenditures of
    $98.2 million in 2005 mainly used in support of new product
    developments, overseas expansions and business acquisitions.
    Cash flows related to restricted cash decreased by
    $27.9 million, from a cash inflow of $20.5 million in
    2006 to a cash outflow of $7.4 million in 2007, primarily
    due to the funding to the D&O insurance trust to increase
    coverage due to the growth of our company. In 2005, we used cash
    of $309.9 million for the 2005 acquisitions,
    $34.8 million for restricted cash funding to escrow
    accounts in relation to the 2005 acquisitions, and
    $9.8 million for minority equity investment.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $1,238.5 million
    and $89.6 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively. In 2007
    we repurchased 69.4 million shares of our common stock at
    an average price of $23.37 per share, or a total of
    $1,623.2 million. In 2006, we repurchased 10.1 million
    shares of our common stock at an average price of
    $18.51 per share, or a total of $186.4 million.
    In addition, cash was provided during both periods from the
    issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises
    and stock purchase plans for a total of $355.0 million and
    $87.1 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007
    and 2006, tax benefits of $19.7 million and
    $9.7 million, respectively, from tax deductions in excess
    of the expense recognized for employee stock options was
    presented as financing cash flows due to the adoption of
    FAS 123R, beginning on January 1, 2006. Tax deductions
    in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options
    were included in operating cash flows in 2005 before the
    adoption of FAS 123R. Approximately $10.0 million of
    receivables sold under our distributor financing program had not
    been recognized as revenue as of December 31, 2007 and
    therefore such amounts were recorded as net borrowings under
    cash flows from financing activities.

Net cash provided by financing activities was
    $146.0 million in 2005 primarily due to common stock issued
    in relation to employee option exercises and purchases under our
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types
    and maturities. In addition, a portion of our cash and
    marketable securities are held in

non-U.S. domiciled

countries. These securities are generally classified as

available-for-sale

and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance
    sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as
    a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss).



At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material
    adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
    Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material
    impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do
    not currently hedge these interest rate exposures.

The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value
    of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2007 and

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes
    other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the
    changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in
    interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical
    parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus
    50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are
    representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds
    Rate.

Foreign
    Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations
    in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for
    speculative or trading purposes.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate
    transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign
    currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These
    derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in
    other income (expense) in the same period as the changes in the
    fair value from the re-measurement of the underlying assets and
    liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities
    between one and two months.

Our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in
    U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses are denominated in
    U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including
    the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen.
    Periodically, we use foreign currency forward

and/or

option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives
    are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less
    than one year. The effective portion of the derivative’s
    gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income and, upon occurrence of the
    forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the
    consolidated statements of operations line item to which the
    hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the
    hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in other
    income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations.
    The increase in operating expenses including research and
    development, sales and marketing, as well as general and
    administrative expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations,
    net of hedging, was approximately 2% in 2007.



Equity
    Price Risk

Our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities is inherently
    exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. We
    monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic
    basis. In the event that the carrying value of the equity
    investments exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline
    in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying
    value to its current fair value. We do not purchase our equity
    securities with the intent to use them for trading or
    speculative purposes. The aggregate fair value of our marketable
    equity securities was $8.6 million and $0.8 million as
    of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A hypothetical
    30% adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of
    publicly-traded equity securities would result in an immaterial
    loss.

In addition to publicly-traded securities, we have also invested
    in privately-held companies. These investments are carried at
    cost. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately-held
    companies was $23.3 million and $20.4 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.



ITEM 8.

Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Juniper Networks Inc.’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the
    company’s financial reporting. We assessed the
    effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this
    assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment using those criteria, we concluded that,
    as of December 31, 2007, Juniper Networks Inc.’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the
    effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. Ernst & Young has issued an
    attestation report concurring with management’s assessment,
    which is included on page 65 of this

Form 10-K.

Please note that there are inherent limitations in the
    effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the
    possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding
    of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can
    provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial
    statement preparation. Further, because of changes in
    conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over
    time.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Juniper Networks, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Juniper Networks, Inc. at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, present fairly in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, Juniper Networks, Inc. changed its method of
    accounting for stock-based compensation as of January 1,
    2006, and its method of accounting for uncertain tax positions
    as of January 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Juniper Networks, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited Juniper Network, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Juniper Networks,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
    of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 of
    Juniper Networks, Inc. and our report dated February 28,
    2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1.

Description
    of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or the
    “Company”) designs, develops and sells products and
    services that together provide its customers with
    high-performance network infrastructure that creates responsive
    and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of
    services and applications over a single Internet Protocol
    (“IP”)-based network. The Company organizes its
    business groups into the following three reportable segments:
    Infrastructure, Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”),
    and Service. The Company’s Infrastructure segment primarily
    offers scalable router products that are used to control and
    direct network traffic. The Company’s SLT segment offers
    networking solutions that meet a broad array of its
    customers’ priorities, from securing the network and the
    data on the network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and
    acceleration of applications across a distributed network.
    Together, these elements provide secure networking solutions to
    enable customers to convert legacy networks that provide
    commoditized, best efforts services into more valuable assets
    that provide differentiation, value and increased reliability,
    performance and security to end users. The Company’s
    Service segment delivers world-wide services, including
    technical support and professional services, as well as a number
    of education and training programs, to customers of the
    Infrastructure and SLT segments.

Basis
    of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and
    its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and
    transactions have been eliminated.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related
    disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States requires management to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.
    Estimates are used for revenue recognition, allowance for sales
    returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for contract
    manufacturer obligations, allowance for warranty costs,
    stock-based compensation, goodwill and other impairments, income
    taxes, litigation and settlement costs, and other loss
    contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical
    experience and also on assumptions that it believes are
    reasonable. Actual results experienced by the Company may differ
    materially from management’s estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with an original
    maturity of three months or less are classified as cash and cash
    equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand,
    balances with banks, and highly liquid investments in money
    market funds, commercial paper, government securities,
    certificates of deposit, and corporate debt securities.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of
    securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
    classification as of each balance sheet date. Realized gains and
    losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary
    are determined based on the specific identification method and
    are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    Company’s investments in publicly traded equity securities
    are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
    investments are initially recorded at cost and periodically
    adjusted to fair value through comprehensive income (loss).

Equity
    Investments

Juniper Networks has investments in privately held companies.
    These investments are included in other long-term assets in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets and are carried at cost, adjusted
    for any impairment, as the Company



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

does not have a controlling interest and does not have the
    ability to exercise significant influence over these companies.
    These investments are inherently high risk as the market for
    technologies or products manufactured by these companies are
    usually early stage at the time of the investment by Juniper
    Networks and such markets may never be significant. The Company
    monitors these investments for impairment by considering
    financial, operational and economic data and makes appropriate
    reductions in carrying values when necessary.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments
    including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    accrued compensation, and other accrued liabilities,
    approximates fair market value due to the relatively short
    period of time to maturity. The fair value of investments is
    determined using quoted market prices for those securities or
    similar financial instruments.

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject Juniper Networks to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. Juniper
    Networks maintains its cash and cash equivalents and investments
    in fixed income securities with high-quality institutions and
    only invests in high quality credit instruments. Deposits held
    with banks, including those held in foreign branches of global
    banks, may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such
    deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand
    and therefore bear minimal risk.

Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
    diversified due to the number of entities comprising the
    Company’s customer base and their dispersion across
    different geographic locations throughout the world. Juniper
    Networks performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
    and generally does not require collateral on accounts
    receivable. Juniper Networks maintains reserves for potential
    credit losses and historically such losses have been within
    management’s expectations. One customer accounted for
    12.8%, 14.3% and 13.7% of total net revenues during 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

The Company relies on sole suppliers for certain of its
    components such as application-specific integrated circuits
    (“ASICs”) and custom sheet metal. Additionally,
    Juniper Networks relies primarily on a limited number of
    significant independent contract manufacturers for the
    production of all of its products. The inability of any supplier
    or manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of Juniper
    Networks could negatively impact future operating results.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method over the lesser of the estimated useful life, generally
    three to five years, or the lease term of the respective assets.
    The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of
    the lease or the respective assets, whichever is shorter. Land
    is not subject to depreciation.

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets
    resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using
    the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management
    based on the fair value of assets received. Identifiable
    intangible assets are comprised of purchased trademarks,
    developed technologies, customer and maintenance contracts, and
    other intangible assets. Goodwill is not subject to amortization
    but is subject to annual assessment, at a minimum, for
    impairment by applying a fair-value based test. Future goodwill
    impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. Purchased
    intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives
    ranging from two to nineteen years.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Impairment

The Company evaluates long-lived assets held-for-use for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An
    asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the
    future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If an
    asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. The Company
    assesses the recoverability of its long-lived and intangible
    assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be
    recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the
    related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured
    based on projected discounted future net cash flows.

The Company evaluates goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis
    and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by
    comparing the reporting unit’s carrying value, including
    goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair
    values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination
    of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market
    approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the
    carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value,
    goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed
    to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. As
    discussed in Note 3, in the second quarter of 2006 the
    Company concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was
    impaired and recorded an impairment charge. After recording the
    impairment charge, Juniper Networks conducted its annual
    impairment test as of November 1, 2006 and November 1,
    2007 and determined that the carrying value of the remaining
    goodwill was not impaired. There were no events or circumstances
    from November 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 that
    would impact this assessment. Future impairment indicators,
    including declines in the Company’s market capitalization
    or a decrease in revenue or profitability levels, could require
    additional impairment charges to be recorded.

Revenue
    Recognition

Juniper Networks sells products and services through its direct
    sales force and through its strategic distribution relationships
    and value-added resellers. The Company’s products are
    integrated with software that is essential to the functionality
    of the equipment. Additionally, the Company provides unspecified
    upgrades and enhancements related to the integrated software
    through maintenance contracts for most of its products.
    Accordingly, the Company accounts for revenue in accordance with
    Statement of Position

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, and all related
    interpretations. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has
    occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
    collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement
    generally consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain
    instances, sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and
    related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance,
    when applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. In
    instances where the Company has outstanding obligations related
    to product delivery or the final acceptance of the product,
    revenue is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance
    criteria have been met. The Company assesses whether the sales
    price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and
    whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
    Collectibility is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the
    customer as determined by credit checks and the customer’s
    payment history to the Company. Accounts receivable are recorded
    net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer
    returns and pricing credits.

For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of
    products that include services, the Company allocates revenue to
    each element using the residual method based on vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. Under
    the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to
    delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration
    less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements.
    Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the
    price charged when the element is sold separately. If vendor
    specific objective evidence of fair value of one or more
    undelivered items does not exist, revenue is deferred and
    recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of those elements
    or (ii) when fair value can be established unless



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the
    entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
    contractual support period. For multiple agreements with a
    single customer, the Company accounts for them as either one
    arrangement or separate arrangements depending on their
    interdependency.

For sales to direct end-users and value-added resellers, the
    Company recognizes product revenue upon transfer of title and
    risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is the
    Company’s practice to identify an end-user prior to
    shipment to a value-added reseller. For end-users and
    value-added resellers, the Company has no significant
    obligations for future performance such as rights of return or
    pricing credits. A portion of the Company’s sales are made
    through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing
    credits

and/or

rights of return. Product revenue on sales made through these
    distributors is recognized upon sell-through as reported by the
    distributors to the Company. The Company sells certain interests
    in accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis as part of a
    distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement which was
    established by the Company with a major financing company.
    Accounts receivables sold under this arrangement in advance of
    revenue recognition are accounted for as debt and had a balance
    of $10.0 million and nil as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Deferred revenue on shipments to
    distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits
    and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon
    sell — through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of
    the related product costs of revenue.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated product
    returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price
    protection, in the same period that the related revenue is
    recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical
    sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria
    included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the
    time. In addition, the Company reports revenue net of sales
    taxes.

Shipping charges billed to customers are included in product
    revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of
    product revenues. Costs associated with cooperative advertising
    programs are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at
    the time the related sales are recognized.

Services include maintenance, training and professional
    services. In addition to providing unspecified upgrades and
    enhancements on a when and if available basis, the
    Company’s maintenance contracts include

24-hour

technical support, and hardware repair and replacement parts.
    Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from
    maintenance contracts is deferred and is generally recognized
    ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally
    one to three years. Revenue from training and professional
    services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably
    over the contractual period, which is generally one year or less.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the
    Company’s assessment of the collectibility of customer
    accounts. Juniper Networks regularly reviews its receivables
    that remain outstanding past their applicable payment terms and
    establishes allowance and potential write-offs by considering
    factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of
    the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions
    that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.

Warranties

Juniper Networks generally offers a one-year warranty on all of
    its hardware products and a

90-day

warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the
    products. The warranty generally includes parts and labor
    obtained through the Company’s

24-hour

service center. On occasion, the specific terms and conditions
    of those warranties vary. The Company accrues for warranty costs
    based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under its
    warranty obligations, including material costs, technical
    support labor costs and associated overhead. The warranty
    accrual is included in the Company’s cost of revenues and
    is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that
    affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number
    of installed units, its estimates of anticipated rates of
    warranty claims, costs per claim and estimated support labor
    costs and the associated overhead.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded
    warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

Contract
    Manufacturer Liabilities and Inventories

The Company outsources most of its manufacturing, repair and
    supply chain management operations to its independent contract
    manufacturers and a significant portion of its cost of revenues
    consists of payments to them. Its independent contract
    manufacturers procure components and manufacture the
    Company’s products based on the Company’s demand
    forecasts. These forecasts are based on the Company’s
    estimates of future demand for the Company products, which are
    in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from the
    Company’s sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for
    overall market conditions. The Company establishes accrued
    liabilities, included in other current accrued liabilities on
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, for carrying
    charges and obsolete material charges for excess components
    purchased based on historical trends.

In addition, the Company purchases a small amount of strategic
    component inventory, which is included in other assets, and
    stated at the lower of cost or market. The costs of distributor
    inventory not yet recognized as revenue is recorded net of the
    related product revenue. Service related spares and
    demonstration equipment are expensed to costs of service revenue
    and sales and marketing expense, respectively, when purchased.

Research
    and Development

Costs to research, design, and develop the Company’s
    products are expensed as incurred. Software development costs
    are capitalized beginning when a product’s technological
    feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
    available for general release to customers. Generally, Juniper
    Networks’ products are released soon after technological
    feasibility has been established. As a result, costs subsequent
    to achieving technological feasibility have not been significant
    and all software development costs have been expensed as
    incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as
    incurred. Advertising expense was $4.8 million,
    $6.8 million, and $6.6 million, for 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

Loss
    Contingencies

The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss
    contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. It
    considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or
    the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to
    reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss
    contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it
    is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
    estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information
    available to its management to determine whether such accruals
    should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

In addition, from time to time, the Company is involved in
    disputes, litigation and other legal actions. The Company
    records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated
    liability for a loss contingency only when both of the following
    conditions are met: (i) information available prior to
    issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is
    probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been
    incurred at the date of the financial statements and
    (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. However
    the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially
    different from the Company’s estimates, which could result
    in the need to record additional expenses.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, (“FAS 123R”) which
    requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense
    for all



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

stock-based awards made to employees and directors including
    employee stock options, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”) and purchases under the Company’s
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated fair values.
    FAS 123R supersedes the previous accounting under
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), as
    allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“FAS 123”), for periods beginning in 2006.
    In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”) relating
    to FAS 123R. The Company has applied the provisions of
    SAB 107 in conjunction with its adoption of FAS 123R.

The Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective
    transition method, which requires the application of the
    accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, the first day of
    the Company’s fiscal 2006. FAS 123R requires companies
    to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of
    grant using an option-pricing model. The Company uses the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair
    value of stock options under FAS 123R, consistent with that
    used for pro forma disclosures under FAS 123. The fair
    value of an RSU is equivalent to the market price of the
    Company’s common stock on the grant date. The value of the
    portion of the stock-based award that is ultimately expected to
    vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service
    periods, or in the period of grant if the requisite service
    period has been provided, in the Company’s Consolidated
    Statement of Operations.

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and
    for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 reflect the
    impact of FAS 123R. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method, the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements for 2005 have not been restated to reflect,
    and do not include, the impact of FAS 123R.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included
    (i) compensation expense for stock-based awards granted
    prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 31, 2005 based
    on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of FAS 123 and (ii) compensation expense
    for the stock-based awards granted subsequent to
    December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. In
    conjunction with the adoption of FAS 123R, the Company
    changed its accounting policy of attributing the fair value of
    stock-based compensation to expense from the accelerated
    multiple-option approach provided by APB 25, as allowed under
    FAS 123, to the straight-line single-option approach, as
    allowed under FAS 123R. Compensation expense for all
    expected-to-vest stock-based awards that were granted on or
    prior to December 31, 2005 will continue to be recognized
    using the accelerated attribution method. Compensation expense
    for all expected-to-vest stock-based awards that were granted or
    modified subsequent to December 31, 2005 is recognized on a
    straight-line basis provided that the amount of compensation
    cost recognized at any date is no less than the portion of the
    grant-date value of the award that is vested at that date.
    FAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
    of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
    actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In the
    Company’s stock-based compensation expense required under
    APB 25 and the pro forma information required under FAS 123
    for 2005, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.

Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, stock-based compensation
    expense was recognized in the Company’s consolidated
    statement of operations under the provisions of APB 25. In
    accordance with APB 25, no compensation expense was required for
    the employee stock purchases under the Company’s Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan. Stock-based compensation expense of
    $22.3 million for 2005 was related to employee stock-based
    awards and stock options assumed from acquisitions. As a result
    of adopting FAS 123R, stock-based compensation expense
    recorded for 2007 and 2006 was $88.0 million and
    $87.6 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation under
    FAS 123R for 2006, the year of adoption, was approximately
    $74.4 million higher than that which would have been
    reported had the Company continued to account for stock-based
    compensation under APB 25. Net income for 2006 was approximately
    $51.4 million lower than that which would have been
    reported had the Company continued to account for stock-based
    compensation under APB 25. Unamortized deferred compensation
    associated with stock options assumed from past acquisitions and
    employee stock-based awards of $17.7 million has been
    reclassified to additional paid-in capital in the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet upon the adoption of FAS 123R on
    January 1, 2006. Additional information is discussed in
    Note 9, “Stockholders’ Equity.”

In accordance with FAS 123R, the Company has presented as
    financing cash flows the tax benefits resulting from tax
    deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for
    those options beginning in 2006. Tax benefits from employee
    stock plans of $19.7 million and $9.7 million, which
    related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized, were presented as financing cash flows for 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, tax
    benefits from employee stock plans were presented as operating
    cash flows. Additionally, in accordance with FAS 123R,
    FAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“FAS 109”), and EITF Topic D-32,

Intra-period Tax Allocation of the Effect of Pretax Income
    from Continuing Operations

, the Company has elected to
    recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises
    in additional paid-in capital only if an incremental income tax
    benefit would be realized after considering all other tax
    attributes presently available to the Company.

Derivatives

Periodically, the Company uses derivatives to partially offset
    its market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. The
    Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or
    trading purposes. Juniper Networks uses foreign currency forward
    contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by
    certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and
    liabilities. These derivatives are carried at fair value with
    changes recorded in other income (expense) in the same period as
    changes in the fair value from re-measurement of the underlying
    assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such hedges are
    classified as operating activities. These foreign exchange
    forward contracts have maturities between one and two months.

The Company also uses foreign currency forward

and/or

option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives
    are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less
    than one year. The effective portion of the derivative’s
    gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the
    forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the
    consolidated statements of operations line item to which the
    hedged transaction relates. The Company records any
    ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial
    during 2007, 2006 and 2005 in other income (expense) on its
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows from such
    hedges are classified as operating activities.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax
    liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of
    certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
    differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates
    that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which
    those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The
    Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax
    assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or
    recovered from future taxable income based on the realization
    criteria set forth under FAS 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes,

and records a valuation allowance to reduce its
    deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes to be more
    likely than not realizable. The Company believes it is more
    likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax
    effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
    fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event
    that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined
    not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the
    valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period
    such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company
    subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously
    determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation
    allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment
    to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such
    determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax
    liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
    application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes
    potential liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and the
    extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 is an interpretation
    of FASB Statement 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, and
    it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with
    certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for
    income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or
    expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48
    provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest
    and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and
    transition. Under FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or
    continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more
    likely than not” threshold. In addition, the application of
    FIN 48 may increase an entity’s future effective tax
    rates and its future intra-period effective tax rate volatility.
    The Company’s cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was
    a $19.2 million increase to the opening balance of
    accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 and a
    $1.0 million increase to goodwill.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a
    period from non-owner sources. The Company has presented its
    comprehensive income as part of the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Other comprehensive income includes
    net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities
    and net foreign currency translation gains (losses) that are
    excluded from net income, and unrealized gains (losses) on
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations with

non-U.S. dollar

functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars using
    exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and
    expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using average
    exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency translation
    gains and losses were not material for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The effect of exchange
    rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies was
    immaterial in the years presented.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51

(“FAS 160”).
    FAS 160 addresses the accounting and reporting standards
    for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other
    than the parent,



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s
    ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling
    equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.
    FAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that
    clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the
    parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners.
    FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, and will be adopted by the Company in
    2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this
    standard on its future consolidated results of operations and
    financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141R,

Business Combinations

(“FAS 141R”).
    FAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how
    the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its
    financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the
    acquiree. The statement also provides guidance for recognizing
    and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination
    and determines what information to disclose to enable users of
    the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. FAS 141R is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008. Accordingly, any business combinations
    the Company engages in will be recorded and disclosed following
    existing GAAP until January 1, 2009. The Company expects
    FAS No. 141R will have an impact on its consolidated
    financial statements when effective, but the nature and
    magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature,
    terms and size of the acquisitions it consummates after the
    effective date. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
    this standard on its future consolidated results of operations
    and financial condition.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified

EITF 07-3,

Accounting for Non-Refundable Advance Payments for Goods or
    Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development
    Activities

(“EITF 07-3”).

EITF 07-3

requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or
    services that will be used or rendered for future research and
    development activities be deferred, capitalized and recognized
    as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services
    are performed.

EITF 07-3

is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2007. The Company adopted

EITF 07-3

on January 1, 2008 and does not expect any material impact
    on its consolidated results of operations and financial
    condition.

In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities-including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(“FAS 159”). FAS 159
    expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect
    existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be
    carried at fair value. The objective of FAS 159 is to
    improve financial reporting by providing companies with the
    opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused
    by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without
    having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Under
    FAS 159, an entity may elect to use fair value to measure
    eligible items including accounts receivable, available-for-sale
    and held-to-maturity securities, equity method investments,
    accounts payable, guarantees, and issued debt. The adoption of
    FAS No. 159 is not expected to have a significant impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“FAS 157”).
    FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework and
    gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair
    value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    Under this guidance, fair value measurements would be separately
    disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. FAS 157
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,

(“FSP

FAS 157-2”).

FSP

FAS 157-2

amends FAS 157 to delay the effective date of FAS 157
    for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities until
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, except for
    items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company adopted
    the effective portion of FAS 157 on January 1, 2008
    and does not expect any material impact on its consolidated
    results of operations and financial condition. The Company is
    currently assessing the impact of applying FAS 157 to its
    non-financial assets and liabilities on its future consolidated
    results of operations and financial condition.

Allocation
    of Initial Purchase Consideration

The Company allocated the purchase price to the tangible and
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including
    IPR&D, based on their fair values. The excess purchase
    price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
    is subject to change due to the release of the amounts held in
    escrow for indemnity obligations, additional contingent
    payments, and changes in acquisition related assets and
    liabilities. The fair values assigned to intangible assets
    acquired were based on valuations prepared by independent
    third-party appraisal firms

Existing technology consists of products that have reached
    technological feasibility and includes products in the acquired
    product lines. Existing technology was valued using the
    discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. This method
    calculates the value of the intangible asset as being the
    present value of the after tax cash flows potentially
    attributable to it, net of the return on fair value attributable
    to tangible and other intangible assets.

Patents and core technology represent a combination of
    processes, patents, and trade secrets that were used for
    existing and in-process technology. The value of the trade name
    and trademarks is represented by the benefit of owning these
    intangible assets rather than paying royalties for their use.
    Both of these intangible assets were valued using the royalty
    savings method. This method estimates the value of these
    intangible assets by capitalizing the royalties saved because
    the Company owns the assets.

Relationships with customers represent the rights granted to the
    VAR or distributor to resell certain products. The VAR and
    distributor relationships were valued using the avoided cost
    method, which takes into account the cost of establishing each
    relationship.



Juniper

Maintenance agreements represent the revenue generated by
    contracts with customers who pay for annual maintenance and
    support. The income approach was used to estimate the fair value
    of the maintenance agreements, which includes estimating the
    ongoing, after-tax income expected from maintenance agreements
    in place at the time of each acquisition, including expected
    renewals.

Pro forma results of operations are not presented for the 2005
    acquisitions as the effects of these acquisitions are not
    material to Juniper Networks on either an individual or an
    aggregate annual basis.

Funk Acquisition:

On December 1, 2005,
    the Company completed its acquisition of Funk. Funk was a
    leading provider of standards-based network access security
    solutions, developed products and technologies that protect the
    integrity of the network by ensuring both the user and the
    device meet an organization’s security policies before
    granting access. The purchase price for Funk included a cash
    payment of $110.2 million. Excluded from the initial
    purchase price of $111.3 million was a balance of
    $12.2 million held in escrow for indemnity obligations, of
    which one-half expired in January 2007 and the remaining
    one-half in June 2007. The Company paid $4.8 million and
    $6.6 million in January 2007 and July 2007, respectively,
    upon resolution of certain acquisition related indemnity issues,
    and increased goodwill for the corresponding amounts. Contingent
    payments associated with future employment conditions were
    recorded as compensation expense ratably over the 13 month
    period from the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2007,
    the Company had retained $1.6 million in escrow to satisfy
    potential indemnity obligations.

Acorn Acquisition:

On October 20, 2005,
    the Company completed its acquisition of Acorn. Acorn’s
    products and technologies provide a smooth migration path by
    connecting legacy Time Division Multiplexing
    (“TDM”) and other circuit-based applications across
    next-generation IP networks. The purchase price for Acorn
    included a cash payment of $4.0 million. Excluded from the
    initial purchase price of $4.3 million was a balance of
    $2.5 million held in escrow for indemnity and earn-out
    obligations, which expired on May 30, 2007. The Company
    paid $1.6 million in May 2007, upon resolution of certain
    acquisition related indemnity issues, and increased goodwill by
    the corresponding amount. Contingent payments associated with
    future employment conditions were recorded as compensation
    expense ratably over the 12 month period following the
    acquisition.

Peribit Acquisition:

On July 1, 2005, the
    Company completed its acquisition of Peribit. The acquisition
    enabled the Company to secure and assure the delivery and
    performance of applications over an IP network through premium
    traffic processing. The purchase price for Peribit included a
    cash payment of $50.3 million. The acquisition resulted in
    the issuance of 11.3 million shares of the Company’s
    common stock with a fair value of approximately
    $256.4 million to the former shareholders of Peribit, of
    which, approximately 1.6 million shares with a fair value
    of $35.2 million, established as of the acquisition date,
    were being held in escrow for indemnity obligations prescribed
    by the merger agreement. The common stock issued in the
    acquisition was valued using the average closing price of the
    Company’s common stock over a

five-day

trading period beginning two days before and ending two days
    after the date the transaction was announced on April 26,
    2005. The Company also assumed all of the outstanding Peribit
    stock options with a fair value of approximately
    $36.4 million. Such options were valued using Black-Scholes
    option pricing model with the volatility assumption of 41%,
    expected life of 1.8 years, risk-free interest rate of
    3.6%, and a market value of the Company’s common stock of
    $22.62 per share, which was determined as described above. At
    the close of the acquisition, the Company recorded a liability
    of $3.0 million associated with future lease, severance,
    and other contractual obligations through March 2009. In July of
    2006, the Company released 0.8 million shares valued at
    $10.3 million to the former shareholders of Peribit which
    were formerly held in escrow. The remaining shares in escrow
    expired on February 1, 2007. A total of 0.8 million
    escrow shares were distributed in February 2007 and July 2007 at
    the then current market value of $19.15 per share and $27.22 per
    share, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of
    $14.8 million. The escrow amounts were excluded from the
    initial purchase price of $312.0 million.

Redline Acquisition:

On May 2, 2005, the
    Company completed its acquisition of Redline. Redline was a
    pioneer in the development of Application Front End
    (“AFE”) technology and designed network solutions that
    improve the performance, flexibility, and scalability of
    web-enabled enterprise data centers and public web sites. The
    initial purchase price for Redline included a cash payment of
    $97.5 million, a $3.0 million pre-acquisition loan
    from the Company to Redline which was forgiven, and assumed
    stock options with an aggregate fair value of



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

$21.1 million. The stock options were valued using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of 43% for
    volatility, 1.56 years for expected life, 3.5% for
    risk-free interest rate and a market value of Juniper Networks
    common stock of $22.62 per share, which was determined by using
    the average closing price of the Company’s common stock
    over a

five-day

trading period beginning two days before and ending two days
    after the date the transaction was announced on April 26,
    2005. The Company also assumed $1.0 million in net
    liabilities. In 2006, the Company recorded an additional
    $13.2 million cash escrow payment to the initial purchase
    price of $123.1 million related to Redline’s indemnity
    obligations which expired in 2006. There were no escrow payments
    in connection with the Redline acquisition during 2007. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had retained
    $0.7 million in escrow to satisfy potential indemnity
    obligations.

Kagoor Acquisition:

On May 1, 2005, the
    Company completed its acquisition of Kagoor. Kagoor was a
    leading provider of session border control products for
    voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) networking. The initial
    purchase price for Kagoor included $58.2 million in cash
    and assumed stock options with an aggregate fair value of
    $7.6 million. The stock options were valued using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of 43% for
    volatility, 1.58 years for expected life, 3.5% for
    risk-free interest rate and a market value of Juniper Networks
    common stock of $21.64 per share, which was determined by using
    the average closing price of the Company’s common stock
    over a

five-day

trading period beginning two days before and ending two days
    after the date the transaction was announced on March 29,
    2005. Excluded from the initial purchase price of
    $66.3 million is an escrow payment of $6.8 million
    related to the indemnity obligations associated with this
    acquisition, $2.0 million of which was paid in 2006. In
    February 2007, the Company distributed an additional
    $4.6 million to former Kagoor stockholders upon final
    settlement of the escrow account.

In-Process Research &
    Development:

The Company’s methodology for
    allocating the purchase price for purchase acquisitions to
    in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is
    determined through established valuation techniques in the
    high-technology communications equipment industry. Projects that
    qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not yet reached
    technological feasibility and have no alternative future use.
    IPR&D is expensed upon acquisition. There was no IPR&D
    expense for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. For
    the year ended December 31, 2005, total IPR&D expense
    was $11.0 million in connection with the Funk, Peribit and
    Kagoor acquisitions. There was no IPR&D from the Acorn and
    Redline acquisitions.

For Funk, these IPR&D efforts pertained to the development
    of Radius products including Steel-Belted Radius
    (“SBR”), SBR High Availability (“HA”), and
    Mobile IP Module (“MIM”) II products. Funk’s
    IPR&D as of the acquisition date also included development
    of the new versions for Endpoint Assurance, for Proxy (Remote
    Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the
    acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts
    would be completed over the next four months at an estimated
    cost of approximately $0.9 million. These development
    efforts have been completed as of December 31, 2007.

For Peribit, these IPR&D efforts included the development
    of the next versions of software for the Sequence Reducer
    (“SR”) family, Sequence Mirror (“SM”)
    family, the Central Management System (“CMS”)
    products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM
    families. At the time of the acquisition, it was estimated that
    these development efforts would be completed over the next
    twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately
    $2.3 million. These development efforts have been completed
    as of December 31, 2007.

For Kagoor, these IPR&D efforts included a variety of
    signaling protocols and next generation products and operating
    systems. At the time of the acquisition, it was estimated that
    these development efforts would be completed over the next eight
    months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.8 million.
    These development efforts have been completed as of
    December 31, 2007.

Deferred Stock-Based Compensation:

Unvested
    stock options valued at $13.2 million, $3.8 million,
    and $2.0 million were issued for the Peribit, Redline, and
    Kagoor acquisitions, respectively. The unvested portion of the
    intrinsic value of the replacement stock options, established as
    of the acquisition date, has been allocated to deferred
    compensation in the purchase price allocation and is being
    amortized to expense using the graded-vesting method over the
    remaining vesting period.

The Company performed a goodwill impairment review as of
    November 1, 2007 and concluded that there was no impairment
    in 2007. In 2006, the Company concluded that the carrying value
    of goodwill for the SLT segment was impaired and recorded an
    impairment charge of $1,280.0 million in operating
    expenses. There was no goodwill impairment in 2005.

A significant portion of the goodwill was initially recorded
    based on stock prices at the time the related merger agreements
    were executed and announced. The impairment of goodwill in 2006
    was primarily attributable to the decline in the Company’s
    market capitalization that occurred over a period of
    approximately six months prior to the impairment review as of
    May 31, 2006 and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the
    forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach.

The first step of the 2006 impairment review was to compare the
    fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value,
    including the goodwill related to the respective reporting
    units. When performing the 2006 goodwill impairment review, the
    Company determined that it had four reporting units at the time
    of the impairment calculation, consisting of Infrastructure and
    Service, which are the same as the respective segments, as well
    as Security and Application Acceleration which were the two
    components of SLT segment. The Company utilized an external
    service provider to calculate the fair value of the reporting
    units using a combination of the income and market approaches.
    The income approach requires estimates of expected revenue,
    gross margin and operating expenses in order to discount the sum
    of future cash flows using each particular business’
    weighted average cost of capital. The Company’s growth
    estimates were based on historical data and internal estimates
    developed as part of its long-term planning process. The Company
    tested the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of its
    discounted



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

cash flow analysis by comparing to available market data. In
    determining the carrying value of the reporting unit, the
    Company allocated the fair values of shared tangible net assets
    to each reporting unit based on revenue derived by that
    reporting unit. As the fair values of the Security and
    Application Acceleration reporting units were lower than the
    allocated book values, goodwill was considered impaired. As a
    result, the Company performed step two of the goodwill
    impairment calculation for those two reporting units within the
    SLT segment in order to calculate the extent of the goodwill
    impairment.

During the second step of the 2006 goodwill impairment review,
    management calculated the fair value of the Company’s
    tangible and intangible net assets with the assistance of an
    external service provider. Identified intangible assets were
    valued specifically for each reporting unit tested. The
    difference between the calculated fair value of each reporting
    unit and the sum of the identified net assets results in the
    residual value of goodwill. Future impairment indicators,
    including declines in the Company’s market capitalization,
    could require additional impairment charges.

In 2007, goodwill increased $33.9 million primarily due to
    payments of $32.8 million upon resolution of acquisition
    related indemnity issues and the release of amount held in
    escrow funds, as well as the distribution, from an escrow
    account, of approximately 0.8 million shares of its common
    stock, with an aggregate fair value of $14.8 million, in
    connection with the resolution of certain indemnity obligations
    related to past acquisitions. Additionally, goodwill increased
    by $1.0 million as the Company recorded the cumulative
    effect of applying FIN 48 in 2007. In 2006, the goodwill
    increase of $25.0 million was primarily attributable to the
    settlements of the Company’s escrow obligations. The
    Company released from its escrow accounts 0.8 million
    shares of common stock, with a total market value of
    $10.3 million, and $2.0 million of its restricted cash
    for the indemnity obligations associated with past acquisitions.
    The Company also distributed $13.1 million of its
    restricted cash for the escrow obligations associated with the
    acquisition of Redline. Goodwill increased in 2005 by
    $470.3 million from the $469.9 million of goodwill
    acquired in the 2005 acquisitions and a $6.4 million
    settlement of the Company’s escrow obligation partially
    offset by a decrease of $6.0 million to reflect the
    misclassified tax benefits from deductions from stock options
    assumed in acquisitions.

There was no significant realized gain or loss from the sale of
    available-for-sale securities in 2007 and 2006. There were
    realized losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities
    of $0.9 million in 2005. We generated cash proceeds of
    $1,029.1 million, $632.1 million, and
    $805.0 million from sales and maturities of our
    available-for-sale investments during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately 60
    investments that were in an unrealized loss position. As of
    December 31, 2006 the Company had approximately 250
    investments that were in an unrealized loss position. The gross
    unrealized losses related to these investments were due to
    changes in interest rates. The contractual terms of these
    investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at
    a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Given
    that the Company has the ability and intent to hold each of
    these investments until a recovery of the fair values, which may
    be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to
    be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006. The Company reviews its investments to identify and
    evaluate investments that have an indication of possible
    impairment. The Company aggregated its investments by category
    and length of time the securities have been in a continuous
    unrealized loss position.

    unrealized gain of $0.2 million as of December 31,
    2007. As of December 31, 2006, government securities
    included governmental sponsored enterprises with an aggregate
    cost of $207.1 million, an aggregate market value of
    $206.1 million, and an unrealized loss of $1.0 million.

Minority
    Equity Investments

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying values of
    the Company’s minority equity investments in privately held
    companies of $23.3 million and $20.4 million,
    respectively, were included in other long-term assets in the
    consolidated balance sheets. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    invested a total of $4.1 million, $7.3 million, and
    $11.0 million in privately-held companies, respectively.

In 2007, one of the Company’s minority equity investments
    completed an initial public offering (“IPO”). Upon
    completion of the IPO, the Company reclassified the minority
    equity investment to available-for-sale investments and realized
    a gain of $6.7 million, based upon the market value at the
    time of IPO and the Company’s cost basis, during 2007.
    Subsequent to the IPO, the Company’s investment in this
    publicly traded entity is included in available-for-sale
    investments. Available-for-sale investments are periodically
    adjusted to fair value through comprehensive income. Realized
    gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than
    temporary for all available-for-sale investments are included in
    interest and other income in the consolidated statement of
    operations. In 2005, the Company recognized a gain of
    $1.7 million due to a business combination of one of its
    portfolio companies with a cost basis of $1.0 million and
    wrote down $0.4 million against its investment in one of
    the privately held companies.

The Company’s minority equity investments in privately held
    companies are carried at cost as the Company does not have a
    controlling interest and does not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over these companies. The Company adjusts
    its minority equity investments for any impairment if the fair
    value exceeds the carrying value of the respective assets.

Restructuring charges were based on Juniper Networks’
    restructuring plans that were committed to by management. Any
    changes in the estimates of executing the approved plans will be

In 2007 the Company paid $0.9 million for facility charges
    associated with its restructuring plans initiated in prior
    years. In June 2006, the Company implemented a restructuring
    plan that focused on some Infrastructure segment product
    development cost reduction efforts and the discontinuation of
    its SBC product line. Approximately $2.0 million including
    $0.6 million of severance charges for 33 employees was
    paid in 2006. In addition to the payments relating to the 2006
    plan, the Company paid $0.7 million for facility charges
    associated with its restructuring plans initiated prior to 2006.
    As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the restructuring reserve
    of $0.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, was
    related to future facility charges. Amounts related to the net
    facility charge are included in other accrued liabilities and
    will be paid over the remaining respective lease term through
    July 2008. The difference between the actual future rent
    payments and the net present value will be recorded as operating
    expenses when incurred.

Acquisition
    Related Restructuring

Acquisition related reserves pertain to the restructuring
    reserves established in connection with the Company’s past
    acquisitions. In conjunction with various acquisitions, the
    Company accrued for acquisition related restructuring charges
    primarily related to severance and facility charges. As of
    December 31, 2007, approximately $1.6 million remained
    unpaid, of which $0.6 million was recorded in other
    long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately $3.6 million remained
    unpaid, of which $1.5 million was recorded in other
    long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

During 2007, the Company reversed $0.3 million of its
    existing acquisition restructuring reserve primarily for
    facility related charges. During 2006, the Company paid
    $3.0 million primarily for the facility related charges. In
    addition, the Company reversed its existing acquisition
    restructuring reserve by $0.4 million that was previously
    accrued for the Unisphere and NetScreen facilities. During 2005,
    the Company reversed its existing acquisition related
    restructuring reserves by $6.9 million primarily due to
    changes in estimates of the previous accrual for the NetScreen
    facility.

The following restructuring charges were based on Juniper
    Networks’ restructuring and acquisition related
    restructuring plans that were committed to by management. Any
    changes to the estimates of executing the approved

Debt

Senior
    Convertible Notes

In 2003, Juniper Networks received $392.8 million of net
    proceeds from an offering of $400.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due
    June 15, 2008 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior
    Notes are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right
    of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future
    senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of the
    Company’s existing and future debt that expressly provides
    that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes are
    convertible into shares of Juniper Networks common stock,
    subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or
    their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate
    is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of
    convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain
    circumstances. The Company reclassified its Senior Notes from
    long-term liabilities to short-term liabilities in the condensed
    consolidated balance sheet during the second quarter of 2007
    because the Senior Notes are due within the next 12 months.

    was converted into common shares.

Credit
    Facility

In June 2007, the Company entered into a senior secured margin
    lending agreement with a third-party financial institution for a
    maximum credit facility of $400.0 million, or 90% of the
    fair market value of the underlying collateral, to establish a
    flexible draw down facility to fund additional stock
    repurchases, as necessary. This credit facility bore a floating
    interest rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus
    40 basis points per annum and, if utilized, would be
    secured by the Company’s publicly traded fixed income
    securities portfolio equivalent to 111% of any outstanding
    balance. This credit facility was terminated on
    September 26, 2007. The Company did not utilize this credit
    facility at any time.

Distributor
    Financing Arrangement

The Company recognized the sale of accounts receivable to the
    financing provider according to Financial Accounting Standard
    No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishment of Liabilities, a replacement of
    FAS 125

. The Company introduced its distributor
    financing program in 2006 to strengthen its channel business by
    promoting greater distributor volume and improved customer
    service. The program does not, and is not intended to, affect
    the timing of revenue recognition because the Company only
    recognizes revenue upon sell-through. Under the financing
    arrangements the proceeds from the financing provider are due to
    the Company 30 days from the sale of the receivable. The
    Company pays the financing provider a financing fee based on the



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

spread over LIBOR or SIBOR. In these transactions with a major
    financing provider, the Company has surrendered control over the
    transferred assets. The accounts receivable have been isolated
    from the Company and put beyond the reach of creditors, even in
    the event of bankruptcy. The purchaser of the accounts
    receivable balances has the right to pledge or exchange the
    assets transferred. The Company does not maintain effective
    control over the transferred assets through obligations or
    rights to redeem, transfer or repurchase the receivables after
    they have been transferred.

Pursuant to the receivable financing arrangements for the sale
    of receivables, the Company sold net receivables of
    $38.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2006
    and $130.4 million during the year ended December 31,
    2007, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, the Company received cash proceeds,
    net of the financing fee, of $95.4 million and
    $24.0 million, respectively. The amounts owing by the
    financing provider recorded as accounts receivable on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of
    December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 were
    $40.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively.

The Company has determined that the portion of the receivable
    financed that has not been recognized as revenue should be
    accounted for as a financing pursuant to EITF Issue

88-18,

Sales of Future Revenues.

As of December 31, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, the estimated amounts of cash
    received from the financing provider that has not been
    recognized as revenue from its distributors was
    $10.0 million at December 31, 2007 and nil at
    December 31, 2006.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash as of December 31, 2007 consisted of escrow
    accounts required by certain 2005 acquisitions and the
    Directors & Officers (“D&O”) trust.
    Juniper Networks established the D&O trust to secure its
    indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers
    arising from their activities as such in the event that the
    Company does not provide or is financially incapable of
    providing indemnification. In 2007 the Company distributed
    $11.5 million, $1.6 million, and $4.6 million of
    its restricted cash upon the settlement of certain escrow
    obligations associated with the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, and
    Kagoor, respectively. In 2007, the Company also added
    $8.9 million to its D&O insurance trust to increase
    coverage due to the overall growth of the Company. In 2006, the
    Company reduced restricted cash by $5.9 million as its
    deposit requirements for standby letters of credits issued for
    facility leases was removed and distributed $13.1 million
    and $2.0 million of its restricted cash upon the settlement
    of certain escrow obligations associated with the Redline and
    Kagoor

Restructuring and acquisition related expenses of

    $1.1 million bonus accrual payable to employees of a past
    acquisition, net of $0.4 million in adjustments made to
    restructuring reserves. Restructuring and acquisition related
    expenses of $5.9 million in 2006 primarily consisted of the
    $5.6 million bonus and earn-out accrual associated with the
    Funk and Acorn acquisitions. During 2006, the Company also
    recorded $0.3 million in net restructuring charges and
    acquisition related restructuring charges. The $6.5 million
    credit to restructuring expense in 2005 primarily consisted of a
    $6.9 million reversal adjustment related to its
    restructuring accrual when the Company re-occupied a portion of
    the former NetScreen facility that was previously included in
    the acquisition-related reserve.

In 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred legal and professional
    fees of $6.0 million and $20.5 million, respectively,
    in connection with its stock option investigation. There were no
    such charges in 2005.

In addition, the Company recognized stock option amendment and
    tax related charges of $8.0 million and $10.1 million
    in 2007 and 2006, respectively, pertaining to the amendment of
    stock options and to the settlement

Operating
    Leases

Juniper Networks leases its facilities under operating leases
    that expire at various times, the longest of which expires in
    2016. Rental expense for 2007, 2006, and 2005, was approximately
    $48.7 million, $40.3 million, and $36.4 million,
    respectively. Future minimum payments under the non-cancellable
    operating leases, net of committed sublease income, totaled
    $221.3 million as of December 31, 2007. Rent and
    related expenses paid to a related party was $6.2 million,
    $4.9 million, and $4.4 million for 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively.

Senior
    Notes

As of December 31, 2007, the Company’s Senior Notes
    had a carrying value of $399.5 million. The Senior Notes
    are due on June 15, 2008. The Company reclassified its
    Senior Notes from long-term liabilities to short-term
    liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet during
    the second quarter of 2007 because the Senior Notes are due
    within the next 12 months.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Purchase
    Commitments

In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate
    component supply, the contract manufacturers place

non-cancelable,

non-returnable

(“NCNR”) orders for components based on the
    Company’s build forecasts. As of December 31, 2007,
    there were NCNR component orders placed by the contract
    manufacturers with a value of $102.8 million. The contract
    manufacturers use the components to build products based on the
    Company’s forecasts and on purchase orders the Company has
    received from customers. Generally, the Company does not own the
    components and title to the products transfers from the contract
    manufacturers to the Company and immediately to the
    Company’s customers upon delivery at a designated shipment
    location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold
    for specified periods of time, the Company may incur carrying
    charges or obsolete materials charges for components that the
    contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet the
    Company’s forecast or customer orders. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had accrued
    $22.2 million based on its estimate of such charges.

Tax
    Liabilities

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $41.5 million
    included in long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance
    sheet for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, the Company
    is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing
    of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to
    uncertainties in the timing of tax and audit outcomes.

Other
    Contractual Obligations

Other contractual obligations consist of the escrow amount of
    $2.2 million and bonus accrual of $0.7 million in
    connection with past acquisitions for indemnity obligations
    expired in 2007, a software subscription requiring payments of
    $5.0 million in both January 2008 and January 2009, and a
    joint development agreement requiring quarterly payments of
    $3.5 million through January 2010.

Guarantees

The Company has entered into agreements with some of its
    customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to
    potential situations where claims could be alleged that the
    Company’s products infringe the intellectual property
    rights of a third-party.

Other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include
    guarantees of product and service performance and standby
    letters of credit for certain lease facilities. The Company has
    not recorded a liability related to these indemnification and
    guarantee provisions and its guarantees and indemnification
    arrangements have not had any significant impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations, or
    cash flows.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in
    the ordinary course of business, such as employment or
    intellectual property claims, including the matters described
    below. The outcome of any such matters is currently not
    determinable. Although the Company does not expect that any such
    legal claims or litigation will ultimately have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results
    of operations, an adverse result in one or more matters could
    negatively affect the Company’s results in the period in
    which they occur.

Federal
    Derivative Lawsuits

Between May 24, 2006 and August 17, 2006, seven
    purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of
    California against us and certain of our current and former
    officers and directors. The lawsuits allege that our officers
    and directors either participated in illegal back-dating of

and appointed as the lead plaintiffs Timothy Hill,
    Employer-Teamsters Local Nos. 175 & 505 Pension
    Trust Fund, and Indiana State District Council of Laborers
    and HOD Carriers Pension Fund. Lead plaintiffs filed a
    consolidated complaint on April 11, 2007. The consolidated
    complaint asserts causes of action for violations of federal
    securities laws, violations of California securities laws,
    breaches of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breaches of
    fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, breach of
    contract, unjust enrichment, gross mismanagement, and insider
    selling and misappropriation of information. The consolidated
    complaint also demands an accounting and rescission of allegedly
    improper stock option grants. The Company has formed a Special
    Litigation Committee, consisting of directors Michael Rose and
    Michael Lawrie, to determine whether it is in the best interests
    of Juniper Networks and its shareholders to pursue any of the
    claims asserted in the derivative litigation. The Special
    Litigation Committee is authorized to pursue, settle or release
    such claims.

State
    Derivative Lawsuits — California

On May 24, 2006 and June 2, 2006, two purported
    shareholder derivative actions were filed in the
    Santa Clara County Superior Court in the State of
    California against the Company and certain of the Company’s
    current and former officers and directors. These two actions
    were consolidated as

In re Juniper Networks Derivative
    Litigation,

No. 1:06CV064294, by order dated
    June 20, 2006. An amended consolidated complaint was filed
    on April 9, 2007. The amended consolidated complaint
    alleges that certain of the Company’s current and former
    officers and directors either participated in illegal
    back-dating of stock options or allowed it to happen. The
    complaint asserts causes of action for unjust enrichment, breach
    of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement,
    waste of corporate assets, insider selling and misappropriation
    of information, and violations of California securities laws.
    Plaintiffs also demand an accounting and rescission of allegedly
    improper stock options grants, and a constructive trust of
    proceeds derived from allegedly illicit stock options. The
    Company has formed a Special Litigation Committee, consisting of
    directors Michael Rose and Michael Lawrie, to determine whether
    it is in the best interests of Juniper Networks and its
    shareholders to pursue any of the claims asserted in the
    derivative litigation. The Special Litigation Committee is
    authorized to pursue, settle or release such claims.

Federal
    Securities Class Action

On July 14, 2006 and August 29, 2006, two purported
    class actions were filed in the Northern District of California
    against the Company and certain of the Company’s current
    and former officers and directors. On November 20, 2006,
    the Court consolidated the two actions as

In re Juniper
    Networks, Inc. Securities Litigation,

No. C06-04327-JW,

and appointed the New York City Pension Funds as lead
    plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated
    Class Action Complaint on January 12, 2007, and filed
    an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on
    April 9, 2007. The Amended Consolidated Complaint alleges
    that the defendants violated federal securities laws by
    manipulating stock option grant dates to coincide with low stock
    prices and issuing false and misleading statements including,
    among others, incorrect financial statements due to the improper
    accounting of stock option grants. The Amended Consolidated
    Complaint asserts claims for violations of the Securities Act of
    1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all
    persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Juniper
    Networks’ publicly traded securities from July 12,
    2001 through and including August 10, 2006. On June 7,
    2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss certain of the
    claims, and a hearing was held on September 10, 2007. The
    Court has not yet issued a ruling.

was filed by Jeanne M. Calamore in the Northern District of
    California against the Company and certain of the Company’s

    that the proxy statement for the Company’s 2006 Annual
    Meeting of Stockholders contained various false and misleading
    statements in that it failed

to disclose stock option backdating information. As a result,
    plaintiff seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief with
    respect to the Company’s 2006 Equity Incentive Plan,
    including seeking to invalidate the plan and all equity awards
    granted and grantable thereunder. On May 21, 2007, the
    Company filed a motion to dismiss and plaintiff filed a motion
    for preliminary injunction. On July 19, 2007, the Court
    issued an order denying plaintiff’s motion for a
    preliminary injunction and dismissing the complaint in its
    entirety with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed an amended
    complaint on August 27, 2007, and defendants filed a motion
    to dismiss on October 9, 2007. Plaintiff filed her
    opposition on December 21, 2007 and defendants filed their
    reply on January 25, 2008. A hearing was held on
    February 11, 2008. The Court has not yet issued a ruling.

Settlement
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

On August 28, 2007, the Company announced that the
    Commissioners of the SEC authorized the settlement between the
    Company and the SEC regarding the previously disclosed SEC
    inquiry into the Company historical stock option granting
    practices. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the
    SEC’s complaint, the Company agreed to settle the charges
    by consenting to a permanent injunction against any future
    violations of the antifraud, reporting,

books-and-records

and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.
    The SEC filed the complaint,

SEC v. Juniper Networks,
    Inc.

, Case No. C 07 4430-JW, in the Northern District
    of California on August 28, 2007. The Company’s
    consent to entry of final judgment was also filed on
    August 28, 2007. No monetary penalties were assessed
    against the Company in conjunction with this settlement. This
    settlement concludes the SEC’s formal investigation of the
    company with respect to the Company’s historical stock
    option granting practices. The Court entered the final judgment
    on December 7, 2007.

IPO
    Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First
    Boston Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal
    Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG Cowen Securities
    Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase
    (Hambrecht & Quist LLC), J.P. Morgan
    Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith
    Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
    Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”), the
    Company and certain of the Company’s officers. This action
    was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s common
    stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999
    and the Company’s secondary offering in September 1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that
    the prospectus pursuant to which shares of common stock were
    sold in the Company’s initial public offering and the
    Company’s subsequent secondary offering contained certain
    false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the
    practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation
    of shares of common stock in these offerings and their receipt
    of commissions from customers related to such allocations.
    Various plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar
    allegations concerning the initial public offerings of
    approximately 300 other issuers. These various cases pending in
    the Southern District of New York have been coordinated for
    pretrial proceedings as

In re Initial Public Offering
    Securities Litigation

, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs
    filed a consolidated amended complaint in the action against the
    Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in the
    coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October
    2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the case
    without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation. On
    February 19, 2003, the court granted in part and denied in
    part the motion to dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims
    against the Company.

In June 2004, a stipulation of settlement and release of claims
    against the issuer defendants, including the Company, was
    submitted to the court for approval. On August 31, 2005,
    the court preliminarily approved the settlement. In December
    2006, the appellate court overturned the certification of
    classes in the six test cases that were selected by the
    underwriter defendants and plaintiffs in the coordinated
    proceedings. Because class certification was a condition of the
    settlement, it was unlikely that the settlement would receive
    final Court approval. On

    proposed settlement based upon a stipulation among the parties
    to the settlement. Plaintiffs have filed amended master
    allegations and amended complaints in the six focus cases, which
    the defendants in those actions have moved to dismiss.
    Plaintiffs have also sought class certification in the six focus
    cases, which the defendants in those actions have opposed. It is
    uncertain whether there will be any revised or future settlement.

    Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which
    prohibits short-swing trading, against the Company’s IPO
    underwriters. The complaint, Vanessa Simmonds v. The
    Goldman Sachs Group, et al., Case

No. C07-01577,

in District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeks
    the recovery of short-swing profits. The Company is named as a
    nominal defendant. No recovery is sought from the Company in
    this matter.

IRS
    Notices of Proposed Adjustments

The IRS has concluded an audit of the Company’s federal
    income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004,
    the Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment
    (“NOPA”) from the IRS. While the final resolution of
    the issues raised in the NOPA is uncertain, the Company does not
    believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results
    of operations. The Company is also under routine examination by
    certain state and non-US tax authorities. The Company believes
    that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable
    outcome related to these audits.

In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of the
    Company’s US payroll tax returns were examined for fiscal
    years 1999 — 2001, and the Company received a second
    NOPA in the amount of $11.7 million for employment tax
    assessments primarily related to the timing of tax deposits
    related to employee stock option exercises. The Company agreed
    to settle this issue with the IRS through the appeals process
    for approximately $2.7 million and made this payment in the
    second quarter of 2007.

In 2007, the IRS opened an examination of the Company’s
    U.S. federal income tax and employment tax returns for the
    2004 fiscal year. Subsequently, the IRS extended their
    examination of the Company’s employment tax returns to
    include fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Company has not received
    any NOPAs related to these audits.

Stockholders’
    Equity

Stock
    Repurchase Activities

In July 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors (“the
    Board”) authorized a stock repurchase program. This program
    authorized repurchases of up to $250.0 million of the
    Company’s common stock. In 2006, the Company repurchased
    10,071,100 common shares at an average price of $18.51 per
    share, with an aggregate fair value of $186.4 million, as
    part of this stock repurchase program. As of December 31,
    2006, a total of 12,939,700 common shares had been repurchased
    and retired since the inception of the program, equating to
    approximately $250.0 million at an average price of $19.32
    per share. The purchase price of the shares of the
    Company’s stock repurchased under this program was
    reflected as a reduction to retained earnings.

In July 2006, the Board approved a new stock repurchase program
    (“2006 Stock Repurchase Program”) authorizing the
    Company to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of Juniper
    Networks’ common stock under this program. In February
    2007, the Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under
    this stock repurchase program. Coupled with the prior
    authorization of $1.0 billion announced in July 2006, the
    Company is now authorized to repurchase up to a total of
    $2.0 billion of its common stock under the 2006 Stock
    Repurchase Program. Purchases under the 2006 Stock Repurchase
    Program are made from time to time as permitted by securities
    laws and other legal requirements and are subject to a review of
    the circumstances in place at the time. During 2007, the Company
    repurchased a total of 69,443,946 shares of common stock
    via open market purchases at an average price of $23.37 per
    share, or a total

    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

purchase price of $1,623.2 million, of which
    $1,622.7 million was reflected as an increase to
    accumulated deficit and the remainder as a decrease to
    additional paid-in capital. Common stock repurchases under the
    program were recorded based upon the settlement date of the
    applicable trade for accounting purposes. All common shares
    repurchased under this program have been retired. As of
    December 31, 2007, the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program had
    remaining authorized funds of $376.8 million.

Additional purchases under this stock repurchase program may be
    made from time to time and are subject to a review of
    circumstances in place at the time. This program may be
    discontinued at any time. See Note 15 below for discussion
    of our stock repurchase activity in 2008.

Stock
    Option Plans

Amended
    and Restated 1996 Stock Plan

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Plan (the
    “1996 Plan”) provided for the granting of incentive
    stock options to employees and non-statutory stock options to
    employees, directors and consultants. On November 3, 2005,
    the Board adopted an amendment to the 1996 Plan to add the
    ability to issue RSUs under the 1996 Plan. RSUs represent an
    obligation of the Company to issue unrestricted shares of common
    stock to the grantee only when and to the extent that the
    vesting criteria of the award are satisfied. In the case of
    RSUs, vesting criteria can be based on time or other conditions
    specified by the Board or an authorized committee of the Board.
    However, until vesting occurs, the grantee is not entitled to
    any stockholder rights with respect to the unvested shares. The
    Company had authorized 164,623,039 shares of common stock
    for issuance under the 1996 Plan. Effective May 18, 2006,
    additional equity awards under the 1996 Plan have been
    discontinued and new equity awards are being granted under the
    2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”).
    Remaining authorized shares under the 1996 Plan that were not
    subject to outstanding awards as of May 18, 2006 were
    canceled on May 18, 2006. The 1996 Plan will remain in
    effect as to outstanding equity awards granted under the plan
    prior to May 18, 2006.

Under the 1996 Plan, incentive stock options were not permitted
    to be granted at an exercise price less than the fair market
    value per share of the common stock on the date of grant. The
    Company has not granted incentive stock options since June 1999.
    Non-statutory stock options were permitted to be granted at an
    exercise price determined by the Board or a committee authorized
    by the Board. Vesting and exercise provisions were permitted to
    be determined by the Board or a committee authorized by the
    Board. Options granted under the 1996 Plan generally become
    exercisable over a four-year period beginning on the date of
    grant and have a maximum term of ten years.

    Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan

In July 2000, the Board adopted the Juniper Networks 2000
    Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”). The
    2000 Plan provided for the granting of non-statutory stock
    options to employees, directors and consultants. Non-statutory
    stock options were permitted to be granted under the terms of
    the plan at an exercise price determined by the Board or a
    committee authorized by the Board. Vesting and exercise
    provisions were permitted to be determined under the terms of
    the plan by the Board or an authorized committee of the Board.
    Options granted under the 2000 Plan generally become exercisable
    over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant and have
    a maximum term of ten years. The Company had authorized
    90,901,437 shares of common stock for issuance under the
    2000 Plan. Effective May 18, 2006, additional equity awards
    under the 2000 Plan have been discontinued and new equity awards
    are being granted under the 2006 Plan. Remaining authorized
    shares under the 2000 Plan that were not subject to outstanding
    awards as of May 18, 2006 were canceled on May 18,
    2006. The 2000 Plan will remain in effect as to outstanding
    equity awards granted under the plan prior to May 18, 2006.

    Equity Incentive Plan

On May 18, 2006, the Company’s stockholders adopted
    the 2006 Plan to enable the granting of incentive stock options,
    nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, restricted stock, stock
    appreciation rights, performance shares,



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

performance units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents
    to the employees and consultants of the Company. The 2006 Plan
    also provides for the automatic, non-discretionary award of
    nonstatutory stock options to the Company’s non-employee
    member of the Board (“outside directors”).

The maximum aggregate number of shares authorized under the 2006
    Plan is 64,500,000 shares of common stock, plus the
    addition of any shares subject to outstanding options under the
    1996 Plan and 2000 Plan that subsequently expired unexercised
    after May 18, 2006 up to a maximum of 75,000,000 additional
    shares of the common stock. To the extent a 2006 Plan award is
    settled in cash rather than stock, such cash payment shall not
    reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the
    2006 Plan. Performance shares, restricted stock or RSUs with a
    per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of market price
    of the Company’s common stock on the day of the grant are
    counted against the plan share reserve as two and one-tenth
    shares for every one share subject to the award. In the case of
    a restricted stock or performance share award, the entire number
    of shares subject to such award would be counted against the
    plan share reserve at the time of grant. Such shares could be
    subject to vesting provisions based on time or other conditions
    specified by the Board or an authorized committee of the Board.
    The Company would have the right to repurchase unvested shares
    subject to a restricted stock or performance share award if the
    grantee’s service to the Company terminated prior to full
    vesting of the award. Until repurchased, such unvested shares
    would be considered outstanding for dividend, voting and other
    purposes.

Incentive and nonstatutory stock options may be granted at an
    exercise price of not less than the fair market value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date such option is granted.
    The exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a 10%
    or greater stockholder may not be less than 110% of the fair
    market value of the common stock on the grant date. Vesting and
    exercise provisions are determined by the Board, or an
    authorized committee of the Board. Stock options granted under
    the 2006 Plan generally vest and become exercisable over a four
    year period. Restricted stock, performance shares, RSUs or
    deferred stock units that vest solely based on continuing
    employment or provision of services will vest in full no earlier
    than the three year anniversary of the grant date. In the event
    vesting is based on factors other than continued future
    provision of services, such awards will vest in full no earlier
    than the one year anniversary of the grant date. Options granted
    under the 2006 Plan have a maximum term of seven years from the
    grant date while incentive stock options granted to a 10% or
    greater stockholder have a maximum term of five years from the
    grant date.

The 2006 Plan provides each non-employee director an automatic
    grant of an option to purchase 50,000 shares of common
    stock upon the date on which such individual first becomes a
    director, whether through election by the stockholders of the
    Company or appointment by the Board to fill a vacancy (the
    “First Option”). In addition, at each of the
    Company’s annual stockholder meetings (i) each
    non-employee director who was a non-employee director on the
    date of the prior year’s annual stockholder meeting shall
    be automatically granted an option to purchase
    20,000 shares of common stock, and (ii) each
    non-employee director who was not an non-employee director on
    the date of the prior year’s annual stockholder meeting
    shall receive an option to purchase a pro-rata portion of the
    20,000 shares of the common stock determined by the time
    elapsed since the individual’s First Option grant
    (“the Annual Option”). The First Option vests monthly
    over approximately three years from the grant date subject to
    the non-employee director’s continuous service on the
    Board. The Annual Option shall vest monthly over approximately
    one year from the grant date subject to the non-employee
    director’s continuous service on the Board. Under the 2006
    Plan, options granted to non-employee directors have a maximum
    term of seven years. No restricted stock, stock appreciation
    right, performance unit, deferred stock unit or dividend
    equivalent has been issued as of December 31, 2007. The
    Company had issued 21.3 million and 4.3 million of
    stock options and RSUs, respectively, under the 2006 Plan as of
    December 31, 2007. The Company had issued 6.6 million
    and 0.7 million of stock options and RSUs, respectively,
    under the 2006 Plan as of December 31, 2006.

Plans
    Assumed Upon Acquisition

In connection with past acquisitions, the Company assumed
    options and restricted stock under the stock plans of the
    acquired companies. The Company exchanged those options and
    restricted stock for Juniper Networks’



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

options and restricted stock and, in the case of the options,
    authorized the appropriate number of shares of common stock for
    issuance pursuant to those options. As of December 31,
    2007, there were approximately 3.7 million common shares
    subject to outstanding awards under plans assumed through past
    acquisitions. There were no shares of restricted stock subject
    to repurchase as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of
    December 31, 2006, there were approximately
    8.8 million shares subject to outstanding awards under
    plans assumed through acquisitions. During 2007, there were no
    repurchases of shares of restricted common stock. During 2006,
    333 shares of restricted common stock were repurchased at
    an average price of $0.35 per share in connection with employee
    terminations. During 2005, 6,517 shares of restricted
    common stock have been repurchased at an average price of $0.33
    per share in connection with employee terminations.

Equity
    Award Activity

In 2007, the Company granted RSUs covering approximately
    2.9 million shares of common stock to its employees under
    the 2006 Plan. In 2007, the Company also granted performance
    share awards to eligible executives covering 0.7 million
    shares of common stock that vest in 2010 provided certain annual
    performance targets and other vesting criteria are met. RSUs
    generally vest over a period of three or four years from the
    date of grant. Until vested, RSUs and performance share awards
    do not have the voting rights of common stock and the shares
    underlying the awards are not considered issued and outstanding.
    The Company expenses the cost of RSUs, which is determined to be
    the fair market value of the shares of the Company’s common
    stock at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which
    the restrictions lapse. In addition to RSUs and performance
    share awards, during 2007, the Company also granted employee
    stock options covering 14.7 million shares of common stock
    under the 2006 Plan. The Company estimated the stock
    compensation expense for its performance share awards as of
    December 31, 2007 based on the vesting criteria and
    recorded $0.4 million in operating expenses for 2007.

The intrinsic value of options exercised was
    $291.7 million, $107.8 million, and
    $240.1 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This
    intrinsic value represents the difference between the fair

    the exercise and the exercise price of each option.

Total fair value of options vested during 2007 was
    $78.8 million. As of December 31, 2007, approximately
    $161.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a

    $44.0 million of this total unrecognized compensation cost
    was estimated to be forfeited prior to the vesting of such
    awards and had been excluded from the preceding cost.

Extension
    of Stock Option Exercise Periods for Former Employees

The Company could not issue any securities under its
    registration statements on

Form S-8

during the period in which it was not current in its SEC
    reporting obligations to file periodic reports under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, during parts of
    2006 and 2007, options vested and held by certain former
    employees of the Company could not be exercised until the
    completion of the Company’s stock option investigation and
    the Company’s public filings obligations had been met (the
    “trading black-out period”). The Company extended the
    expiration date of these stock options to April 7, 2007,
    the end of a 30 — day period subsequent to the
    Company’s filing of its required regulatory reports. As a
    result of the extensions, the fair values of such stock options
    had been reclassified to current liabilities subsequent to the
    modification and were subject to mark-to-market provisions at
    the end of each reporting period until the earlier of final
    settlement or April 7, 2007. Stock options covering
    approximately 660,000 shares of common stock were scheduled
    to expire and could not be exercised as a result of the trading
    black-out period restriction during the first quarter of 2007.
    The Company measured the fair value of these stock options using
    the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and recorded an
    expense of approximately $4.3 million in the first quarter
    of 2007. In addition, the Company recorded an expense of
    $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2007 associated with
    the approximately 1,446,000 shares covered by such options
    which had exercise periods extended in 2006 as a result of the
    trading black-out period restriction. As of December 31,
    2007, all of these extended stock options were either exercised
    or expired un-exercised. All previously recorded liabilities
    associated with such extensions were reclassified to additional
    paid-in capital by the second quarter of 2007.

Amendment
    of Certain Stock Options

In 2007, the Company completed a tender offer to amend certain
    options granted under the 1996 Plan and the 2000 Plan that had
    original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair
    market value per share of the common stock underlying the option
    on the option’s grant date, as determined by the Company
    for financial accounting purposes. Under this tender offer,
    employees subject to taxation in the United States and Canada
    had the opportunity to increase their strike price on affected
    options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the
    date of grant so as to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under
    United States Internal Revenue Code Section 409A
    (“409A issue”) or Canadian tax laws and regulations.
    In exchange for increasing the strike price of these options,
    the Company committed to make a cash payment to employees
    participating in the offer so as to make employees whole for the
    incremental strike price as compared to their original option
    exercise price. In connection with this offer, the Company
    amended options to purchase 4.3 million shares of its
    common stock and committed to make aggregate cash payments of
    $7.6 million to offer participants and recorded such amount
    as operating expense in 2007.

In addition, the Company entered into a separate agreement with
    two executives in 2007 to amend their unexercised stock options
    covering 0.1 million shares of the Company’s common
    stock in order to cure the 409A issue associated with such stock
    options. As a result, the Company committed to make aggregate
    cash payments of $0.4 million and recorded this payment
    liability as operating expense in 2007.

Acceleration
    of Unvested and “Out-of-the-Money” Employee Stock
    Options

On December 16, 2005, the Board approved the acceleration
    of the vesting of certain unvested and
    “out-of-the-money” stock options that had an exercise
    price per share equal to or greater than $22.00, all of which
    were previously granted under its stock option plans and that
    were outstanding on December 16, 2005. Options to purchase
    approximately 21.2 million shares of common stock or 49.3%
    of the total outstanding unvested options on December 16,
    2005 were accelerated. The options accelerated excluded options
    previously granted to certain employees, including all of the
    Company’s executive officers and its directors.

In addition, the acceleration of the unvested and
    “out-of-the-money” options was accompanied by
    restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the
    exercise of accelerated options. Those restrictions will prevent
    the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would
    have originally vested had the optionee been employed on such
    date, whether or not the optionee is actually an employee at
    that time.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The purpose of the acceleration was to enable the Company to
    avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these
    options in future periods in the Statements of Operations
    pursuant to FAS 123R. Under FAS 123R, the Company has
    applied the expense recognition provisions relating to stock
    options beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In
    approving the acceleration, the Company’s Board considered
    its impact on future financial results, stockholder value and
    employee retention. The Board believes that the acceleration of
    the unvested and “out-of-the-money” options was in the
    best interest of stockholders as it will reduce the
    Company’s reported compensation expense in future periods
    in light of these accounting regulations. As a result of the
    acceleration, the Company expected to reduce the pre-tax stock
    option expense it otherwise would have been required to record
    by approximately $153.0 million, which was estimated at the
    time of the acceleration, subsequent to the adoption of
    FAS 123R beginning in 2006. The acceleration of the vesting
    of these options did not result in a charge to the results of
    operations in 2005.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In April 1999, the Board approved the adoption of Juniper
    Networks 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase
    Plan”). The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
    acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through
    periodic payroll deductions of up to 10% of base compensation.
    Each employee may purchase no more than 6,000 shares in any
    twelve-month period, and in no event, may an employee purchase
    more than $25,000 worth of stock, determined at the fair market
    value of the shares at the time such option is granted, in one
    calendar year. The Purchase Plan is implemented in a series of
    offering periods, each six months in duration, or a shorter
    period as determined by the Board. The price at which the common
    stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair market
    value of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the
    applicable offering period or on the last day of the applicable
    offering period.

In January 2007, the Board approved a delay of the start of the
    next offering period from February 1, 2007 to April 1,
    2007. Such offering period ended on July 31, 2007.
    Compensation expense of $7.6 million was recorded in 2007
    for stock costs associated with the Purchase Plan. For 2006,
    compensation expense related to the common stock issued under
    the Purchase Plan was $6.6 million. Compensation expense
    for the Purchase Plan in the same 2005 periods was only required
    as a footnote disclosure prior to the adoption of FAS 123R.
    As a result of the Company’s failure to file its Quarterly
    Reports on

Form 10-Q

for the second and third quarters of 2006, the Company had
    suspended its employee payroll withholdings for the purchase of
    its common stock under the Purchase Plan from August 2006
    through March 2007.

Employees purchased approximately 0.6 million,
    1.7 million, and 0.9 million shares of common stock
    through the Purchase Plan at an average exercise price of
    $17.08, $13.06 and $19.96 per share during fiscal years 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2006, the number of
    authorized shares under the Purchase Plan increased by
    3,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2007,
    approximately 7.1 million shares had been issued and
    10.9 million shares remained available for future issuance
    under the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2006,
    approximately 6.5 million shares had been issued and
    8.5 million shares remained available for future issuance
    under the Purchase Plan.

Common
    Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

As of December 31, 2007, Juniper Networks had reserved an
    aggregate of approximately 150.0 million shares of common
    stock for future issuance under all its Stock Option Plans, the
    1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and for future issuance upon
    conversion of convertible senior notes.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Valuation
    of Stock-Based Compensation

FAS 123R requires the use of a valuation technique, such as
    an option-pricing model, to calculate the fair value of
    stock-based awards. The Company has elected to use the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which incorporates
    various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and
    risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility is based on
    the implied volatility of market traded options on the
    Company’s common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors
    including historical volatility of the Company’s common
    stock over the most recent period commensurate with the
    estimated expected life of the Company’s stock options. The
    expected life of an award is based on historical experience and
    on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to
    employees, as well as the potential effect from options that had
    not been exercised at the time.

In 2006, the Company began granting stock option awards that
    have a contractual life of seven years from the date of grant.
    Prior to 2006, stock option awards generally had a ten year
    contractual life from the date of grant. As a result, the
    expected term assumption used in the year ended
    December 31, 2007 reflects the shorter contractual life of
    the new option awards granted during the period.

The assumptions used and the resulting estimates of
    weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and for
    employee stock purchases under the ESPP during those periods are
    summarized as follows:

In anticipation of adopting FAS 123R, the Company refined
    the variables used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model during
    2005. As a result, the Company refined its methodology of
    estimating the expected term to be more representative of future
    exercise patterns. The Company also refined its computation of
    expected volatility by considering the volatility of publicly
    traded options to purchase its common stock and its historical
    stock volatility. The weighted average estimated fair value of
    employee stock options granted during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was
    $8.03, $6.09 and $9.23 per option, respectively. The weighted
    average estimated fair value of shares granted under the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was
    $6.52, $5.19 and $6.36 per share, respectively.

Convertible
    Preferred Stock

There are 10,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock
    with a par value of $0.00001 per share authorized for issuance.
    No preferred stock was issued and outstanding as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

    January 1, 2005, the Company increased the match from 50%
    to 100% of eligible pay, up to an annual maximum of $2,000.
    Effective January 1, 2007, the Company matches 25% of all
    employee contributions. All matching contributions vest
    immediately. The Company’s matching contributions to the
    plan totaled $9.5 million, $5.8 million, and
    $5.1 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Note 11.

Segment
    Information

The Company’s chief operating decision maker
    (“CODM”) and senior management team (together,
    “management”) allocate resources and assess
    performance based on financial information by the Company’s
    business groups which are categorized into the following three
    reportable segments: Infrastructure, SLT, and Service. For
    arrangements with both Infrastructure and SLT products, revenue
    is attributed to the segment based on the underlying purchase
    order, contract or sell-through report.

The Infrastructure segment includes products from the E-, M-, T-
    and MX-series router product families as well as the
    circuit-to-packet products. The SLT segment consists primarily
    of Firewall virtual private network (“Firewall”)
    systems and appliances, secure sockets layer virtual private
    network (“SSL”) appliances, intrusion detection and
    prevention appliances (“IDP”), application front end
    platforms, the J-series router product family and wide area
    network (“WAN”) optimization platforms. The Service
    segment delivers world-wide services to customers of the
    Infrastructure and the SLT segments.

The primary financial measure used by management in assessing
    performance and allocating resources to the segments is
    management operating income, which includes certain cost of
    revenues, research and development expenses, sales and marketing
    expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Direct costs
    and operating expenses, such as standard costs, research and
    development, and product marketing expenses, are generally
    applied to each segment. Indirect costs, such as manufacturing
    overhead and other cost of sales, are allocated based on
    standard costs. Indirect operating expenses, such as sales,
    marketing, business development, and general and administrative
    expenses are generally allocated to each segment based on
    factors including headcount and revenue. The CODM does not
    allocate stock-based compensation, amortization, impairment,
    gain or loss on minority equity investments, interest income and
    expense, other income and expense, income taxes, as well as
    certain other charges to segments. With management’s
    organizational alignment initiatives and the ever-evolving
    business environment such as changes in products or markets,
    acquisitions, long-term growth strategies, and the experience
    and responsibilities of the senior executives in charge, the
    Company may reorganize its segments consistent with
    corresponding changes in its organizational structure in 2008.

Net
    Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net income
    per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential
    shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive
    potential common shares consist of incremental common shares
    subject to repurchase, common shares issuable upon exercise of
    stock options, and shares issuable upon conversion of the
    Subordinated Notes. The following table presents the calculation
    of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in millions,

For 2006, the Company excluded 34.6 million common stock
    equivalents consisting of convertible debt, outstanding stock
    options, RSUs and shares subject to repurchase from the
    calculation of diluted loss per share because all such
    securities were anti-dilutive due to the net loss in the year.
    For the years ended 2007, 2006, and 2005, approximately
    11.5 million, 51.1 million, and 28.8 million

    $28.7 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The
    Company also had federal and California tax credit
    carry-forwards of approximately $14.3 million and
    $84.0 million, respectively. Approximately
    $14.3 million of the federal tax credit carryforwards and
    $10.8 million of the California tax credit carryforwards
    will be credited to additional paid in capital when utilized on
    the Company’s income tax returns since they have not met
    the realization criteria of FAS 123R. Unused net operating
    loss carry-forwards and research and development tax credit
    carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the
    years 2012 and 2022, respectively. The California tax credits
    carry forward indefinitely.

The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are
    considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
    The Company has made no provision for U.S. income taxes on
    approximately $436.9 million of cumulative undistributed
    earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through
    December 31, 2007 because it is the Company’s
    intention to permanently reinvest such earnings. If such
    earnings were distributed, the Company would accrue additional
    income taxes expense of approximately $130.9 million. These
    earnings are considered indefinitely invested in operations
    outside of the U.S. as we intend to utilize these amounts
    to fund future expansion of our international operations.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on
    January 1, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2007. The
    cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was a
    $19.2 million increase to the opening balance of
    accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 and a
    $1.0 million increase to goodwill. As of December 31,
    2007, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
    $94.7 million, of which approximately $79.3 million,
    if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

The following is a rollforward of the Company’s total gross
    unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for fiscal 2007 (in
    millions):

In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, it
    recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense in the
    consolidated statement of operations. This policy did not change
    as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. As of the date of
    adoption, the Company had accrued interest expense and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits of $4.1 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company accrued interest expense and
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of
    $5.9 million within other long-term liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded net interest
    expense of $1.7 million in its consolidated income
    statements during 2007.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next
    12 months due to audit examinations. However, an estimate
    of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time due
    to the high uncertainty of the resolution of

and/or

closure on open audits.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, Juniper
    Networks or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax
    returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state
    and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business the
    Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities
    throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as
    Ireland, Hong Kong, U.K., France, Germany, The Netherlands,
    Japan, China, Australia, and the U.S. With few exceptions,
    the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and
    local, or

non-U.S. income

tax examinations for years before 2003, although carryforward
    attributes that were generated prior to 2003 may still be
    adjusted upon examination by the IRS if the attributes either
    have been or will be used in a future period.

The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the
    2004 tax year and by the German tax authorities for the 2005 tax
    year. Additionally, the Company has not reached a final
    resolution with the IRS on an adjustment it proposed for the
    1999 and 2000 tax years. The Company was not under examination
    by any other major jurisdictions in which the Company files its
    income tax returns as of December 31, 2007. It is possible
    that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits
    may change within the next 12 months. However, an estimate
    of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time. We
    have provided for uncertain tax positions that require a
    FIN 48 liability.

American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004 — Repatriation of Foreign
    Earnings

In 2005, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Board of
    Directors approved and repatriated $225.0 million in
    foreign earnings under a domestic reinvestment plan in
    accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (“Jobs Act”). The Company recorded a net tax benefit
    in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation
    dividend. The net tax benefit consists of a federal and state
    tax provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million,
    offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an
    adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un-repatriated
    earnings.

Subsequent
    Events

Stock
    Repurchases

In February 2008, the Company repurchased
    2.2 million shares of its common stock, for
    $53.1 million at an average purchase price of $24.61 per
    share, under its 2006 Stock Repurchase Program. As of the report
    filing date, the Company’s 2006 Stock Repurchase Program
    had remaining authorized funds of $323.8 million. Purchases
    under this plan are subject to a review of the circumstances in
    place at the time. Acquisitions under the share repurchase
    program may be made from time to time as permitted by securities
    laws and other legal requirements. The program may be
    discontinued at any time.

Phase
    Out of DX Products

In January 2008, the Company announced its plan to phase out its
    DX product line. The action has no material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
    and financial condition for the year ended December 31,
    2007.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting:

Please see
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting under Item 8 on page 62 of this

Form 10-K,

which report is incorporated herein by reference.

(b) For the “Report of Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm,” please see the report under Item 8
    on page 65 of this

Form 10-K,

which report is incorporated herein by reference.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of our
    CEO and CFO, which are required in accordance with

Rule 13a-14

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This
    “Controls and Procedures” section includes information
    concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in
    the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with
    the certifications for a more complete understanding of the
    topics presented.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based
    upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of the
    end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the company in reports
    that it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules
    and forms, and that material information relating to our
    consolidated operations is made known to our management,
    including the CEO and CFO, particularly during the period when
    our periodic reports are being prepared.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

In 2007, we initiated a multi-year implementation to upgrade
    certain key internal IT systems, including our company-wide
    human resources management system, customer relationship
    management (“CRM”) system and our enterprise resource
    planning (“ERP”) system. This project is the result of
    our normal business process to evaluate and upgrade or replace
    our systems software and related business processes to support
    our evolving operational needs. There were no changes in our
    internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
    the fourth quarter of 2007 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that
    our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial
    reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A
    control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
    control system’s objectives will be met. Our controls and
    procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our
    control system’s objective will be met and our CEO and CFO
    have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
    effective at the reasonable assurance level. The design of a
    control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
    limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
    can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
    or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances
    of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
    circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
    part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    controls in future periods are subject to risks. Over time,



controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
    or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
    procedures.
