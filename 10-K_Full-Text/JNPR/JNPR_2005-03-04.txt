PART I

ITEM 1. Business

Overview

We design and sell products and services that together provide our customers with Internet
Protocol (“IP”) secure networking solutions. Our solutions are incorporated into the global web of
interconnected public and private networks across which a variety of media, including voice, video
and data, travel to and from end users around the world. Our network infrastructure solutions
enable service providers and other network-intensive businesses to support and deliver services and
applications on a highly efficient and low cost integrated network. Our security solutions meet a
broad array of our customer’s security priorities, from protecting the network itself, to
protecting data on the network. Together, our secure networking solutions enable our customers to
convert networks that provide commoditized, best efforts services into more valuable assets that
provide differentiation and value and increased reliability and security to end users.

In April 2004, we completed our acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (“NetScreen”).
NetScreen developed, marketed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for
enterprises, carriers and government entities. As a result of the NetScreen acquisition, we
expanded our customer base and portfolio of products, and now offer two categories of networking
products: infrastructure products, which consist predominately of the original Juniper Networks
products, and security products, which consist predominately of the former NetScreen products.

During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, we generated annual revenues of $1.3 billion
and conducted business in approximately 75 countries. See the information in Item 8 for more
information on our financial position as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and our results of
operations and cash flows for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1997. Our
corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California. Our website address is
www.juniper.net.

The Juniper Networks Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to provide best-in-class traffic processing technologies that
allow our customers to provide a secure and assured network experience for any application on an IP
network. Our technological leadership and problem solving abilities combined with our experience
and fundamental understanding of the requirements of high performance IP secure networking
solutions will help us in meeting our objectives. Key elements of our strategy are described
below.

Maintain and Extend Technology Leadership

. Our application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
technology, software and network-optimized product architecture have been key elements to
establishing our technology leadership. We believe that these elements can be leveraged into
future products we are currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our technological
leadership in the network infrastructure and security markets primarily through innovation and
continued investment in our research and development departments, supplemented by external
partnerships, including joint development with alliances, as well as acquisitions that would allow
us to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets.

Leverage Early Lead as Supplier of Purpose-Built Network Infrastructure and Security

. From
inception we have focused on designing and building IP network infrastructure for service providers
and network intensive businesses and have integrated purpose-built technology into a network
optimized architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs. We believe that many of these
customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors. The purpose-built advantages of
our infrastructure

- 1 -


and security products provide us with a time-to-market lead, which is a critical
advantage in gaining rapid penetration as one of these selected vendors. Once our products have
been widely deployed in a customer’s network, it becomes more difficult for potential competitors
to sell to those customers in the future.

Be Strategic to Our Customers

. In developing our infrastructure and security solutions, we
work very closely with customers to design and build a product specifically to meet their complex
needs. Over time, we have expanded our understanding of the challenges facing these customers. That
increased understanding has enabled us to subsequently design additional capabilities into our
products. We believe our close relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers have
been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date. We plan to continue to work very
closely with our customers to implement enhancements to current products as well as to design
future products that specifically meet their evolving needs.

Enable New IP-Based Services

. Our platforms enable network operators to build and secure
networks cost effectively and to offer new differentiated services for their customers more
efficiently than conventional products. We believe that the secure delivery of IP-based services
and applications, including web hosting, outsourced Internet and intranet services, outsourced
enterprise applications and voice-over IP, will continue to grow and are cost-effectively enabled
by our secure networking solutions.

Establish and Develop Industry Partnerships

. Our customers have diverse requirements. While
our products meet certain requirements of our customers, our products are not intended to satisfy
certain other requirements. Therefore we believe that it is important that we build relationships
with other industry leaders in a diverse set of networking technologies and services. These
relationships ensure that we have access to those technologies and services, whether through joint
venture, resale, acquisition or other collaboration, in order to better support a broader set of
our customers’ requirements.

Markets and Customers

We sell our products and services through distributors and value-added resellers to end-users
in the following markets:

Service Providers

Service providers include wireline, wireless and cable operators. Supporting most major
service provider networks in the world, our platforms are designed and built for the scale and
dependability that service providers demand. Our secure networking solutions benefit these
customers by:

•

Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple services over the same
network using our high density, highly reliable platforms;

•

Promoting generation of additional revenue by enabling new services to be offered to
new market segments based on our product capabilities;

•

Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by enabling consumers to
self-select automatically provisioned service packages that provide the quality, speed
and pricing they desire; and

•

Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on investment as their
networks can scale to multi-terabit rates based on the capabilities of our platforms.

Enterprise

Our secure networking solutions are designed to meet the reliability and scalability demanded
by the world’s largest and most advanced networks. For this reason, network intensive enterprises
that rely on their networks for the essence of their business are able to deploy our solutions as a
powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge
applications while:

- 2 -


•

Reducing costs through operational efficiencies in implementing and managing the
network;

•

Driving down capital expenses with sophisticated network intelligence that is
robust, secure and scalable; and

•

Providing enterprises with the control necessary to deliver a secure and assured
user experience to their customers and internal clients.

Public Sector

The public sector includes federal, state and local governments and research and education
institutions. Our solutions provide the security, dependability, and performance required by
leading government agencies, including the United States Department of Defense, intelligence and
civilian agencies. Research and education (R&E) networks push the envelope in networking and
applications, continually demanding the most advanced products and technologies while
simultaneously helping shape their development. These networks help academic researchers and
educators transform their vision into reality with scientific and educational advancements using
applications such as telemedicine, 3D visualization and simulation, grid computing, and
collaborative videoconferencing. Juniper Networks helps the public sector secure and assure their
networking infrastructure by:

•

Delivering best-in-class network security without impacting performance or the
ability to turn on additional services;

•

Providing highly dependable (reliable, available, and stable) products to ensure
that government networks are operational and available;

•

Offering flexible and comprehensive service and support packages designed for
federal customers; and

•

Working as a business partner for the long term with the optimal combination of
flexibility, responsiveness, technical know-how and financial strength.

Fundamental Requirements for High Performance Secure Networks

As they work to support growth in IP traffic and seek to offer new revenue generating or
mission-critical services, our customers require secure network solutions that are not only feature
rich but also deliver high reliability, high performance and assured user experiences.

At the same time, both service providers and enterprises must focus on detecting and
preventing the ever increasing number of security threats facing the network itself and the data
that flows across the network. This security must be innate to networking products and must not
come at the expense of overall performance or unjustifiable cost.

Feature richness, high reliability, security, high performance, scalability, and cost
effectiveness are each fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the growth in
IP traffic and the secure and assured delivery of value-added services to end users.

Feature Richness.

The importance of increasing revenue streams and decreasing capital and
operational costs for our customers is a significant priority in the industry. Service providers
want to sell more revenue generating services with better cost efficiencies. Enterprises and other
network operators want to provide a secure and assured network experience to their end users on a
cost effective but value-generating basis. Each of these goals is ultimately a function of the
features and capabilities that can be securely provided on each of the network elements. As
networks advance, more and more features are required to sell new services as well as to lower the
ongoing costs of operating the network. Next generation networking solutions therefore need to have
flexibility to add new capabilities frequently without compromising the performance of the system,
which gets increasingly difficult as the network demands increase.

- 3 -


High Reliability

. As businesses and consumers increasingly rely on IP networks for
mission-critical applications, high network reliability is essential. As a result, those businesses
and consumers expect service providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their networks.

Security

. Today’s network environment presents an ever-increasing number of challenges
regarding network security ranging from simple denial of service attacks to sophisticated,
pervasive and malicious intrusions. The importance of security is increasing within all of our
customers and we are continually improving and evolving the
security capabilities on all of our product solutions. It is extremely important to provide
comprehensive network-based security services that are fully integrated, free of performance
trade-offs and scaleable to any customer or market.

High Performance Without Compromising Intelligence

. To handle the rapid growth in IP traffic,
today’s network operators increasingly require secure networking solutions that can operate at
higher speeds, while still delivering real-time services such as security and quality-of-service
features. The processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated forwarding
technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination based on priority, data type and
other considerations. Since a large number of IP packets, many of which perform critical
administrative functions, are small in size, high performance IP routers need to achieve their
specified transmission speeds even for small packet sizes. Since smaller packets increase packet
processing demands, routing large numbers of smaller packets tends to be more resource intensive
than routing of larger packets. A wire speed router, which achieves its specified transmission rate
for any type of traffic passing through it, can accomplish this task. Thus, provisioning of
mission-critical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by wire speed
processing.

High Performance Under Stressful Conditions

. In a large and complex network, individual
components inevitably fail. However, the failure of an individual device or link must not
compromise the network as a whole. In a typical network, when a failure occurs, the network loses
some degree of capacity and, in turn, a greater load falls on the remaining network routers, which
must provide alternate routes. IP infrastructure must quickly adjust to the new state of the
network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid dropping significant numbers of packets when
active routes are lost or when large numbers of routes change. Routing protocols are used to
accomplish this convergence, a process that places even greater stress on the router. Given the
complexity of IP network infrastructure, the convergence process is far more complex and places a
far greater load on the router, thereby requiring a much more sophisticated device.

Scalability

. Due to the rapid growth in IP traffic, service providers must continuously expand
their networks, both in terms of increased numbers of access points of presence (PoPs), and also
greater capacity per PoP. To facilitate this expansion process, secure networking solutions must
be highly scalable. Next generation routers and security appliances therefore need to be flexible
and configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring minimal downtime.

High Return on Investment

. Continued growth in IP traffic, price competition in the
telecommunications market and increasing pressure for network operators to attain higher returns on
their network infrastructure investments all contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that
significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate their networks. In
addition to the basic cost of equipment, network operators incur substantial ancillary costs for
the space required to deploy the equipment, power consumed and ongoing operation and maintenance of
the equipment. Network operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied equipment configurations
in limited amounts of rack and floor space. Therefore, in order to continue to scale their networks
toward higher data speeds in a cost effective manner, network operators need the ability to mix and
match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities, without significantly
increasing the consumption of space or power and driving costs higher.

These requirements define a clear need for IP infrastructure and security solutions that can
support high speeds and offer new IP-based services. At the same time, network operators are
eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the level of scalability and reliability within their
networks and reduce the cost of their architectures.

Juniper Networks Technology and Products

Early in the Company’s history, we developed, marketed and sold the first commercially
available purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the specific high performance needs of
service providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to increase, the need for service rich
platforms at the edge of the network was created. Our infrastructure products are designed to
address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless access by
combining high-performance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a
network-optimized solution.

With the acquisition of NetScreen, we have added a broad family of network security solutions
that deliver high performance, cost-effective security for enterprises, service providers and
government entities. We offer firewall
and virtual private network (“VPN”) systems and appliances, as well as a line of intrusion
detection and prevention (“IDP”) appliances.

Both our infrastructure and security solutions are built upon ASIC and software expertise. Our
infrastructure products offer a full suite of scalable, tested routing protocols, which are used to
control, and direct network traffic, and are critical to a network routing solution. This control
is made more important by the fact that the size and complexity of IP networks are increasing at a
time when service providers are looking to differentiate themselves through value-added service
offerings. Our firewall and VPN systems are standards-based for easy integration into customer
networks, and deliver integrated firewall, VPN and denial of service protection capabilities in a
single device. Our IDP appliances incorporate multiple methods of detection, such as attack pattern
matching, protocol anomaly detection and backdoor detection, and stop attacks based on known
patterns of attack, suspicious traffic or connection requests.

Infrastructure Products

We believe that an overview of the physical nature of our infrastructure products is helpful
in understanding the operation of our business.

Although specific designs vary among our product families, our platforms are essentially
modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. The chassis contains components
that enable and support many of the fundamental functions of the router, such as power supplies,
cooling fans, and components that run our JUNOS or JUNOSe operating system, perform high-speed
packet forwarding, or keep track of the structure of the network and instruct the packet forwarding
components where to send packets. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to
be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces.

The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from
the network over a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission
medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely
depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. In some cases, modules do not
contain ports or physically receive packets from the network, but rather enhance the overall
functionality of the router. We refer to these components as service modules.

Major Infrastructure Product Families

M-Series and T-Series:

Our M-series platforms are extremely versatile as they can be deployed
at the edge of operator networks, in small and medium core networks, and in other applications.
The M-series product family includes the M320, M160, M40e, M20, M10i and M7i platforms. Our
T-series platforms, T640 and T320, are primarily designed for core IP infrastructures. The
M-series and T-series products leverage our ASIC technology and the same JUNOS operating system to
ensure continuous and predictable service delivery, while reducing capital and operational costs.

E-Series:

Our E-series products are a full featured platform with support for carrier-class
routing, broadband subscriber management services and a comprehensive set of IP services. The
E-series family includes the ERX-1440, -1410, -710, -705 and -310 platforms. Leveraging our JUNOSe
operating

- 5 -


system, the E-Series service delivery architecture enables service providers to easily
deploy innovative revenue generating services to their customers and avoid the costly and limiting
piecemeal outcomes that result from equipment that delivers inconsistent edge services. All
E-Series platforms offer a full suite of routing protocols and provide scalable capacity for tens
of thousands of users.

Major Security Product Families

Firewall and VPN Systems:

Our NetScreen-5400, -5200, -1000 and -500 products are high
performance security systems designed to provide integrated firewall, VPN and denial of service
protection capabilities for enterprise environments and carrier network infrastructures. Each can
be deployed in high bandwidth environments and can be used to deliver managed security services.
Our firewall and VPN systems allow unique security policies to be enforced for multiple virtual
local area networks, or VLANs, allowing a single system to secure multiple networks. Our security
systems also allow for the creation of multiple Virtual Systems, each providing a unique security
domain with its own virtual firewall and VPN and dedicated management interface. These features
enable
enterprises, carriers and government entities to use a single security system to secure
multiple networks and enable carriers to deliver security services to multiple customers.

Firewall and VPN Appliances

: Our NetScreen-208, -204, -100, -50, -25, -5XT and -5XP security
appliances are fixed configuration products of varying performance characteristics that offer
integrated firewall, VPN and denial of service protection capabilities. Our security appliances
are designed to maximize security and performance while using less physical space than competing
products. Our security appliances can be deployed to provide small to medium-sized businesses and
enterprise remote locations with secure Internet access and communication.

Secure Access Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) VPN Appliances

: Our Secure Access-5000, -3000 and
- -1000 appliances are used to secure remote access for mobile employees, secure extranets for
customers and partners, and secure intranets. Our SSL VPN appliances are designed to be used in
enterprise environments of all sizes.

Intrusion Detection and Prevention (“IDP”) Appliances

: Our IDP-1000, -500, -100 and -10
appliances utilize intrusion detection methods to increase the attack detection accuracy and

provide the broadest attack detection coverage available. Our IDP appliances provide fast and
efficient traffic processing and alarm collection, presentation and forwarding. Once an attack is
detected, our IDP appliances prevent the intrusion by dropping the packets or connection associated
with the attack, reducing or eliminating the effects of the attack. Our IDP appliances can also
alert the IT staff to respond to the attack. Our IDP appliances can be clustered to provide high
availability and reduce risk associated with a single point of failure.

See Note 12 in Item 8 for a breakdown of net product revenues by categories of products.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution Structure

As of December 31, 2004, the Company employed a staff of 1,057 employees in our worldwide
sales and marketing organizations. These sales employees operate within their respective regions
and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our
strategic distribution relationships and value-added resellers. Information concerning our
revenues by significant customers and by geographic region can be found in Note 2 and Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Direct Sales Structure

Our direct sales organization is organized into three geographic theaters and within each
theater according to the particular needs in that market. Our three geographic theaters are (i)
the Americas, (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa and (iii) Asia Pacific. Our direct relationships
with our customers are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those
orders or by purchase contracts. In instances where we have contracts with our customer, those
contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified
quantities of our products.

- 6 -


Global Channel System

In our sales and marketing efforts, we also employ a global network of strategic distribution
relationships, as well as theater or country-specific distributors and value added resellers.
Within each theater, in addition to our direct sales force, we employ sales professionals to assist
with the management of our various sales channels.

We have strategic reseller relationships with Ericsson A.B., Lucent Technologies and Siemens
A.G. We believe that each of these companies have significant customer relationships in place and
offer products that complement our product offerings. Our arrangements with each of these partners
allow them to resell our products on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for discounts based
upon the volume of products sold and specify other general terms of sale. The agreements do not
require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products. Siemens accounted for
greater than 10% of our total revenues in 2004.

In addition to these strategic reseller relationships, the Company maintains relationships
with distributors and value-added resellers in various theaters. These distributors and
value-added resellers tend to be focused on particular theaters or particular countries within
theaters. These resellers have expertise in deploying complex networking solutions in their
respective markets. Our agreements with these resellers are non-exclusive, generally
limited by theater, and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These
agreements do not require our distributors or resellers to purchase specified quantities of our
products.

Customer Service and Support

We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful deployment
and ongoing support of our products and we have hired support engineers with proven network
experience to provide those services. In most cases, our customer service and support organization
provides front line product support and is the problem resolution interface to our partners and
direct end users. We offer the following services: 24x7x365 technical assistance, hardware repair
and replacement, unspecified updates, professional services and educational services. We deliver
these services directly to major end users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model,
leveraging the capabilities of our partners and third party organizations. We also train our
partners in the delivery of education and support services.

As of December 31, 2004, we employed 337 people in our worldwide customer service and support
organization.

Research and Development

We have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of
high-end computing, network system design, security, routing protocols and embedded software.
These individuals have been drawn from leading computer data networking and telecommunications
companies. In addition to building complex hardware and software systems, the engineering team has
experience in delivering highly integrated ASICs and scalable technology.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of
enhancing our core technology, developing additional applications, incorporating that technology
and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings. In our infrastructure
and security products, we are leveraging our ASIC technology, developing additional network
interfaces targeted to our customer applications and continuing to develop next generation
technology to support the anticipated growth in IP network requirements. We continue to expand the
functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability, and to provide an
enhanced user interface.

- 7 -


Our research and development process is driven by the availability of new technology, market
demand and customer feedback. We have invested significant time and resources in creating a
structured process for all product development projects. This process involves all functional
groups and all levels within the Company. Following an assessment of market demand, our research
and development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based
on inputs from the product management and sales organizations. This process is designed to provide
a framework for defining and addressing the steps, tasks and activities required to bring product
concepts and development projects to market.

As of December 31, 2004, we employed 1,184 people in our worldwide research and development
organization.

Our research and development expenses totaled $238.4 million, $176.1 million and $161.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Manufacturing and Operations

We employ 105 employees in manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships
with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor and manage product testing
and quality. The majority of our manufacturing operation is outsourced. We currently have
manufacturing relationships primarily with Celestica and Plexus, under which we have subcontracted
the majority of our manufacturing activity. This subcontracting activity extends from prototypes
to full production and includes activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test,
control, shipment to our customers and repairs. We design, specify and monitor all of the tests
that are required to meet internal and external quality standards. These arrangements provide us
with the following benefits:

Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts from us about
our product needs. Each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble
the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications. Products are
then shipped directly to our distributors, value-added resellers or end-user. The Company
generally does not own the components and our customers generally take title to our products upon
shipment from the contract manufacturers. In certain circumstances, we may be liable to our
contract manufacturers for carrying and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased
based on our forecasts.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, those contracts merely set forth a
framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The contracts
do not require them to manufacture our products on a
long-term basis.

Our ASICs are manufactured by IBM and Toshiba, each of whom is responsible for all aspects of
the production of the ASICs using our proprietary designs.

- 8 -


Competition

Competition in the network infrastructure and security markets is intense. Cisco Systems,
Inc. has historically dominated the market, with other companies such as Nortel Networks, Alcatel
S.A., CheckPoint Systems, Inc. and Huawei Technologies providing competitive products. In
addition, a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address
the same needs that our products address. We believe that our ability to compete with Cisco and
others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs
of our current and potential customers and are compatible with Cisco’s current and future products.

We expect that, over time, large companies with significant resources, technical expertise,
market experience, customer relationships and broad product lines, such as Nortel and Alcatel, will
introduce new products which are designed to compete more effectively in this market. As a result,
we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more
resources than we have. Although we believe that our technology and the purpose-built features of
our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we
cannot assure you that we will be successful.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Nortel and Alcatel, have
significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle their products with other networking
products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. Also, many of our
current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases
that could be leveraged. Increased competition could result in price reduction, fewer customer
orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our
operating results.

There are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities
than our products. Consolidation in this industry has begun, with one or more of these smaller
private companies being acquired by large, established suppliers of network infrastructure
products, and we believe it is likely to continue. As a result, we expect to face increased
competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have.

Several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses of routers. For
example, high bandwidth Asynchronous Transfer Mode (“ATM”) switches are used in the core of certain
major backbone service providers. ATM switches can carry a variety of traffic types, including
voice, video and data, using fixed, 53 byte
cells. Companies that use ATM switches are enhancing their products with new software
technologies such as Multi-Protocol Label Switching (“MPLS”), which can potentially simplify the
task of mixing routers and switches in the same network. These substitutes can reduce the need for
large numbers of routers.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed
technology and know-how. Our engineering teams have significant expertise in ASIC design and we
own all rights to the design of the ASICs, which form the core of many of our products. Our
software was developed internally and is protected by United States and other copyright laws.

While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law to protect our technology,
we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new
product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential
to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no assurance that
others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology.

Our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and
protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the
patent applications that we have filed, or that we will be able to obtain the necessary
intellectual property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property
rights.

- 9 -


Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had 2,948 full-time employees, 265 of whom were in general and
administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not
experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key
technical, sales and senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement
requiring service for any defined period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our
key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, train and
retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel
is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key personnel in the future.

ITEM 2. Properties

We lease approximately 1.3 million square feet world wide, with the majority being in North
America. Our corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California and consists of four
buildings totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet. Each building is on an individual lease
or sublease, which provides various option, expansion and extension provisions. The corporate
headquarters leases expire between June 2012 and May 2014. Additionally, we lease an approximately
0.3 million square foot facility in Westford, Massachusetts under two leases. The leases expire
between January and March 2011. We also own approximately 80 acres of land adjacent to our leased
corporate headquarters location.

In addition to our offices in Sunnyvale and Westford, we also lease offices in various
locations throughout the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia
Pacific region, including in China, the Netherlands, Virginia, India, Hong Kong, Canada, France,
Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom and Korea. Our current offices are in good condition and
appropriately support our business needs.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business, such as employment or intellectual property claims, including the matters described
below. The outcome of any such matters is currently not determinable. Although the Company does
not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations, an adverse result in one or
more matters could negatively affect our results in the period in which they occur.

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG
Cowen Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase (Hambrecht & Quist
LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Company and certain of
the Company’s officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s common
stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999 and its secondary offering in September
1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which
shares of common stock were sold in the Company’s initial public offering and its subsequent
secondary offering contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the
practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation of shares of common stock in these
offerings and their receipt of commissions from customers related to such allocations. Various
plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar allegations concerning the initial public offerings
of approximately 300 other issuers. These various cases pending in the Southern District of New
York have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as In re Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the
action against the Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in the coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October
2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the case without prejudice pursuant to a
stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to
dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims against the Company.

In June 2004, a stipulation for the settlement and release of claims against the issuers,
including the Company, was submitted to the Court for preliminary approval. The terms of the
settlement, if approved, would dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants
(including the Company). In exchange for this dismissal, Directors and Officers insurance carriers
would agree to guarantee a recovery by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants of at least
$1 billion, and the issuer defendants would agree to an assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs
of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters. The settlement is
subject to a number of conditions, including certification of a class for
settlement purposes and formal court approval. If the settlement does not occur, and
litigation continues, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the
case vigorously.

Federal Securities Class Action Suit

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, a number of essentially identical shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against the Company and certain of its officers and former officers purportedly on
behalf of those stockholders who purchased the Company’s publicly traded securities between April
12, 2001 and June 7, 2001. In April 2002, the court granted the defendants’ motion to consolidate
all of these actions into one; in May 2002, the court appointed the lead plaintiffs and approved
their selection of lead counsel and a consolidated complaint was filed in August 2002. The
plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false and misleading statements, assert claims for
violations of the federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief. In September 2002, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In March
2003, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint in April 2003 and the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in
May 2003. The hearing on defendants’ motion to dismiss was held in September 2003. In March 2004,
the court granted defendants motion to dismiss, without leave to amend. In April 2004, the
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. The appeal has been fully briefed by the parties. The Court
of Appeals has not yet scheduled arguments on the appeal.

State Derivative Claim Based on the Federal Securities Class Action Suit

In August 2002, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint purportedly filed on
behalf of the Company, captioned In re Juniper Networks, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Civil Action
No. CV 807146, was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara.
The complaint alleges that certain of the Company’s officers and directors breached their fiduciary
duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct including conduct complained of in
the securities litigation described above. The Company is named solely as a nominal defendant
against whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. After having their previous complaints dismissed
with leave to amend, Plaintiffs lodged a third amended complaint in August 2004. Defendants
demurred to the third amended complaint. On November 18, 2004, the Court sustained defendants’
demurrer without leave to amend and entered an order of final judgment against plaintiffs. In
January 2005, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from this ruling. There has not yet been any
briefing or argument on appeal.

Toshiba Patent Infringement Litigation

On November 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit in the United States District Court in
Delaware against the Company, alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe four Toshiba
patents, and seeking an injunction and unspecified damages. There has been limited discovery to
date.

IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustments

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has concluded an audit of the Company’s federal income tax
returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004, the Company received a Notice of Proposed
Adjustment (“NOPA”) from the IRS. While the final resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is
uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for any adjustments that the IRS has proposed with respect to these tax
returns.

In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of the Company’s US payroll tax returns
are currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001, and the Company received a second
NOPA in the amount of $11.7 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing
of tax deposits related to employee stock option exercises. The Company intends to dispute this
assessment with the IRS and resolve the issue at the Appeals level. The Company currently does not
believe that it is probable that any final assessment will be sustained nor does it believe that a
liability can be reasonably estimated at this time. In the event that this issue is resolved
unfavorably to the Company, there exists
the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations for the
period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Report”), including the “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, contains forward-looking statements
regarding future events and the future results of the Company that are based on current
expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company
operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the Company. Words such as
‘expects,’ ‘anticipates,’ ‘targets,’ ‘goals,’ ‘projects,’ ‘intends,’ ‘plans,’ ‘believes,’ ‘seeks,’
‘estimates,’ variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject
to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results
may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
discussed in this Report under the section entitled “Factors That May Affect Future Results” and
elsewhere, and in other reports the
Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), specifically the most
recent reports on

Form 10-Q

and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus included in the Registration Statement
on

Form S-4

filed with the SEC and declared effective on March 11, 2004. The Company undertakes no
obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

The following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales
returns, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets,
especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and
obsolete material charges, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Overview of the Results of Operations

To aid in understanding our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion
of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful.

Significant Events

In April 2004, we completed our acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (“NetScreen”) in
order to expand our customer base and portfolio of products. NetScreen developed, marketed and
sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises, carriers and
government entities. We have included in our results of operations the results of NetScreen
beginning on April 16, 2004; therefore, revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are
significantly greater during 2004 compared to 2003 and 2002.

As a result of the NetScreen acquisition, we expanded our customer base and portfolio of
products, which resulted in two categories of networking products: infrastructure products, which
consist predominately of the original Juniper Networks products, and security products,
which consist predominately of the former NetScreen products.

In July 2002, we completed our acquisition of Unisphere, a subsidiary of Siemens Corporation,
which is a subsidiary of Siemens A.G. (“Siemens”). Since the acquisition Siemens has been one of
our significant resellers. Unisphere developed, manufactured and sold data networking equipment
optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks. The acquisition enabled us to
expand our

- 16 -


customer base and add a complementary product to our existing infrastructure product
line without any need to reorganize or modify our existing organizational or cost structure. We
have included in our results of operations for 2002 the results of Unisphere from July 1, 2002.
The Unisphere acquisition impacted revenue, cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the
second half of 2002. The results for 2003 include a full year of results of the combined
companies.

We have implemented several restructuring plans over the last four years as a result of the
economic slowdown, which began in 2001, and the acquisitions of Unisphere and NetScreen. In
connection with the acquisitions of Unisphere and NetScreen, we initiated plans to eliminate
certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost
structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic
conditions. During the three months ended September 30, 2003, we announced that we would no longer
develop our G-series CMTS products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction
costs, non-inventory asset impairment, costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating
contracts and other related costs. During 2004, we adjusted our restructuring reserves for changes
in estimates, primarily related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed
as a result of the NetScreen acquisition and as the real estate markets changed.

During the three months ended June 30, 2003, we issued $400.0 million of Zero Coupon
Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (“Senior Notes”). From January 1, 2003 through December
31, 2004, we paid $937.0 million to retire all of our remaining 4.75% Convertible Subordinated
Notes due March 15, 2007 (“Subordinated Notes”). These transactions affected our cash, cash
equivalents, investments, interest income and interest expense.

Nature of Expenses

NetScreen had a significant distribution channel in place at the time of the acquisition and
we are using that channel to target new customers and increase sales. We plan to increase the
volume of sales that go through our distribution channel during 2005 compared to prior years. This
shift to selling more products through a distribution channel may impact gross margins.

Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent
contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our
independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract
manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and
standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are
conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent
contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Wisconsin, Canada and Malaysia. Generally, our
contract manufacturers retain title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until
our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract
manufacturer’s facility.

The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual
component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for
carrying or obsolete material charges. Carrying and obsolete charges have decreased each of the
past two years as the global economy and our product revenue improved.

Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and
we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions,
bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. We added over 900 employees across all functions as a
result of the NetScreen acquisition. We added approximately 400 employees from the Unisphere
acquisition in July 2002. We had 2,948, 1,553 and 1,542 employees as of December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments
based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to
increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional
infrastructure systems to support the company’s growth. We expect these costs to continue to
increase during 2005 as our headcount increases.

Research and development expenses include:

•

the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products,

•

outside services for such services as certifications of new products,

•

equipment used for testing

•

and patent related costs.

Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures,
such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of
which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development
costs as they are incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during
2005 compared to prior years to further advance our competitive advantage.

Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services,
demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter-to-quarter depending on
revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We plan to further develop our distribution
channel and increase our sales and marketing costs in an effort to expand and grow our presence in
new markets, serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking security
products.

General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other
corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate
strategic services.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to establish
accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies include:

We have other important accounting policies and practices; however, once adopted, these other
policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or
otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy
itself. We base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe
are standard and reasonable. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and
assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates for various reasons including those
described in “Factors That May Affect Future Results.”

- 18 -


Revenue Recognition

We recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, unless we have
future obligations for such things as customer acceptance, in which case revenue and related costs
are deferred until those obligations are met. In most cases, we recognize product revenue upon
shipment to our customers, including value-added resellers (“VAR”), as it is our practice to
identify an end user prior to shipment to a VAR. We defer revenues on sales to our distributors
until we have information indicating that the distributor has sold the products to its customers.

We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the
period of the obligation. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase
our products and enter into service contracts. Service contracts are typically for one-year
renewable periods and are for services such as 24-hour customer support, non-specified updates and
hardware repairs. In addition to service contracts, we also provide professional and educational
services.

On arrangements where products and services are bundled, we determine whether the deliverables
are separable into multiple units of accounting. We allocate the total fee on such arrangements to
the individual
deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method, as
circumstances dictate. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our
policies for product and service revenue recognition. This process requires us to make judgments
whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have
established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. Our ability
to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less
than the fair values. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted
by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility. We assess the
probability of collection by reviewing our customers’ payment history, financial condition and
credit report. If the probability of collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred
until the payment is collected.

The amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments
made in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns. Although our arrangements
with end-users and VARs generally do not include any contractual rights of return, and our general
policy is that we do not accept returns, under certain circumstances we have accepted, and may in
the future accept, product returns from our customers. Therefore, we do provide a reserve for our
estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded. Our estimate of
future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of
our customer base. In addition, we get input from our sales and support organizations on potential
product returns relating to specific customer issues. The amount of revenue we recognize will be
directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product
returns.

In addition, our agreements with distributors provide for limited stock rotation and price
protection rights. Stock rotation rights provide distributors with the right to exchange unsold
inventory for alternate products of equal or greater value. Price protection rights grant
distributors the right to a credit on certain purchases in the event of decreases in the prices of
our products. We accrue for these credits based on our estimates of expected stock rotation and
price protection obligations. These reserves require us to exercise judgment in determining if
historical experience applies to new products and to new distributors. If our estimate of returns
and exchanges is too low, additional charges will be incurred in future periods and these
additional charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of
operations.

Our resellers and distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other
programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual amounts
paid to our resellers and distributors for these programs were to deviate significantly from our
estimates, which are based on inputs from our channel marketing department and historical
experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.

- 19 -


Warranty Reserves

We generally offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90-day warranty
on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. The warranty generally includes
parts and labor obtained through our 24-hour service center. On occasion, the specific terms and
conditions of those warranties vary. We accrue for warranty costs based on estimates of the costs
that may be incurred under our warranty obligations, including material costs, technical support
labor costs and associated overhead. The warranty accrual is included in our cost of revenues and
is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include
the number of installed units, our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims, costs per
claim and estimated support labor costs and the associated overhead. Our estimates of anticipated
rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and
future forecasts. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and
adjust the amounts as necessary. If actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast,
or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast, our gross
margins could be adversely affected.

Contract Manufacturer Exposures

We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our
independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of
payments
to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our
products based on our build forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand
for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and
marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and
product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our
control, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers,
such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, that would have an adverse impact on our
gross margins and profitability.

Provision for Income Taxes and Tax Related Accruals

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the
determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
differences and carryforwards. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the
realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

and we record a
valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more
likely than not realizable. Accordingly, a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the U.S.
domestic net deferred tax assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future
realization of these assets, in part, due to the potential impact of future stock option
deductions. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities
based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If
payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may
result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no
longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed,
a further charge to expense would result.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our
calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining the amount of the allowance, we
make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and
assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses
in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen. We also consider
our historical level of credit losses. Our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our
actual credit losses. If actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves
we have established, our general and administrative expenses would increase. Conversely, if actual
credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves, our general and administrative
expenses would decrease.

Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization
of purchased intangibles is computed using the straight-line method over the related expected
useful lives of between four and seven years. Goodwill is carried at fair value. We perform
goodwill impairment tests annually and on an interim basis in certain circumstances. We performed
an impairment analysis in November 2004 and determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill
at that time. In addition, on a quarterly basis we assess if there have been any impairment
indictors during the past quarter that could have impacted the carrying value of our goodwill and
purchased intangible assets. When valuing goodwill and purchased intangible assets in connection
with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment, we estimate:

•

the assets and liabilities of our two reporting units: Infrastructure and Security,

•

the market value of each reporting unit,

•

future cash flows applicable to each reporting unit, and

•

the useful lives.

These estimates include using our revenue and earnings multiples as of the test date,
discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units
and the periods of time with which the products will be in demand. Any changes in key assumptions
about the business, reporting units and its prospects, or changes in market conditions or other
externalities, could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations.

Our net revenues for each of the last three years have increased primarily as a result of the
improving global economy, which resulted in increases in our customers’ capital expenditures for
our products. Beginning in mid-2001, the overall global economy deteriorated and most of our
customers reduced their capital expenditure budgets. We began to see these factors improve in
2003, as was evidenced by the increases in infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped.
The following table shows infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped for each of the last three
years:

Infrastructure products contributed $975.7 million to product net revenues during 2004. We
track infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas
of potential network growth. Our Infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular, with
the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that
are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are
the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of
transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred
to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and
throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which
revenue was recognized during the period.

- 21 -


Security products contributed $187.2 million to product net revenues during 2004 based on
approximately 81,000 units and the acquisition enabled us to cross sell Infrastructure and Security
products to both customer bases.

As we have expanded our market share and entered more markets in 2004, we have begun to
experience increased price competition. This price competition has been limited to date, as
evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars and product gross margins compared to the year-ago
period. We expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross
margins in the future.

Service net revenues increased each of the last two years as a result of a larger installed
base of customers and products. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who
purchase our products and enter into service contracts.

Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during 2004 and 2003. Ericsson
A.B. (“Ericsson”) accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during 2003 and 2002.

We experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the Americas
region to Europe and Asia from 2002 to 2003 as our customers’ spending in the Americas region
declined; however, as our customers’ spending
improved from 2003 to 2004, the Americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenues. Given
the current environment, we expect the split among the Americas and international regions to remain
relatively consistent from 2004 to 2005.

The six-point increase in product gross margins from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to
cost-cutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs increasing
at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same periods. In
addition, the standard margins on the Security products are more favorable than the standard
margins on the Infrastructure products. The improvement in gross margins was also a result of a
$16.0 million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from 2003 to 2004 as our historical
charges paid to the contract manufacturers have decreased. The increase in gross margins was
partially offset by acquisition charges related to the NetScreen acquisition, which increased cost
of product revenues by $5.5 million, for an inventory write-up adjustment and the amortization of
the order backlog intangible asset.

- 22 -


The five-point increase in product gross margins from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to
savings in outsourced manufacturing costs as a result of improved efficiencies and cost cutting
initiatives at our contract manufacturers. The increase in product gross margins was also due to a
$19.1 million decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges from 2002 to 2003. In addition,
2002 included a charge of $5.1 million related to the Unisphere acquisition for backlog orders and
an inventory write-up adjustment.

Service gross margins increased three points from 2003 to 2004 and seven points from 2002 to
2003 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a
larger installed base, and thus a more leveraged service organization. This increased leverage is
evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses have decreased as a percentage of
service revenue in each of the last two years: 26% for 2004, 27% for 2003 and 29% for 2002;
however, in absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased $18.5 million from 2003 to 2004
and $3.9 million from 2002 to 2003. The increases in absolute dollars were due to the NetScreen
and Unisphere acquisitions. In addition, in absolute dollars, the outside services costs increased
$9.3 million from 2003 to 2004, primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition. Finally, the costs
associated with spare parts decreased as a percent of service revenue from 2003 to 2004 and
remained approximately the same in terms of absolute dollars; however the costs of spare parts
increased as a percent of service revenue from 2002 to 2003 as the costs increased $2.6 million in
terms of absolute dollars.

Research and development expenses increased $62.3 million in 2004 compared to 2003, but
decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due
to employee related expenses increasing $42.4 million year-over-year as a result of the NetScreen
acquisition. The increase in research and
development expenses was also the result of a $6.5 million increase in expensed equipment
primarily used in test activities and a $5.6 million increase in prototype expense. The increase
in expensed equipment was due to additional research and development requirements resulting from
the NetScreen acquisition. Prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the
testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public, and the amounts
reported in a given period can vary depending on the product being developed and the timing of the
release.

Research and development expenses increased $14.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002, but
decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due
to a $13.2 million increase in employee related expenses as a result of a full year of operations
after the acquisition of Unisphere. In addition, we stopped paying bonuses in 2002 as part of our
overall corporate cost cutting initiatives; however, we started to accrue employee bonuses in the
second half of 2003 as our financial results improved. Offsetting the increase in employee related
expenses was a $2.5 million decrease in consulting and contractor services due to our overall
corporate cost cutting initiatives and a $2.5 million decrease in prototype expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $156.6 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased
as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee
related expenses increasing $104.7 million year-over-year as a result of the NetScreen acquisition
and the increase in revenue. Marketing related expenses increased $22.3 million due to the
NetScreen acquisition, the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution
channel and

- 23 -


channel sales. Outside services increased $7.0 million due to professional services
related to marketing activities. In addition, demonstration equipment increased $6.4 million due
to the NetScreen acquisition and the related purchase of Security demonstration products for our
direct sales force and resellers. Demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely
tied to product launches. To date, we have not incurred significant advertising expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $19.0 million in 2003 compared to 2002, but decreased
as a percent of total net revenues. The majority of the increase in absolute dollars was a $21.4
million increase in employee related expenses in the sales organization. In addition, customer
facing expenses such as marketing events and customer programs increased $2.0 million. Offsetting
the increases was a decrease of $2.8 million for demonstration equipment.

General and administrative expenses increased $24.8 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and
remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by a $13.6
million increase in professional services and a $9.3 million increase in employee related expenses.

General and administrative expenses decreased $5.8 million and as a percent of total net
revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. The majority of the decrease was due to a $7.1 million
reduction in bad debt expense in 2003 compared to 2002. This reduction was a result of more
successful than expected collection efforts and the absence of any significant customer
bankruptcies. The decrease in bad debt expense was partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in
professional services related to certain strategic consulting activities.

Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Deferred Stock Compensation

The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $36.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003
due to the intangible assets purchased in the NetScreen acquisition. The amortization expense of
intangible assets increased $6.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the intangible assets
purchased in the Unisphere acquisition. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more
information on our purchased intangible assets.

The amortization expense of deferred stock compensation increased $41.9 million in 2004
compared to 2003 due to the NetScreen acquisition. Amortization expense of deferred stock
compensation was $2.0 million and $0.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note 3
in Item 8 for more information on our deferred stock compensation.

Restructuring and Other

We have implemented several restructuring plans over the last four years as a result of
the economic slowdown, which began in 2001 and began to improve in 2003, and the acquisitions
of Unisphere and NetScreen. During 2004, we reduced previously established restructuring
reserves by

- 24 -


$5.5 million for changes in estimates, primarily related to changes in lease and
sublease assumptions. We found our needs changed as a result of the NetScreen acquisition and
as the real estate markets changed. This reduction was offset by a restructuring charge of
$0.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2004 primarily related to the NetScreen
acquisition.

The restructuring charge recorded in 2004 has been completely paid out. The remaining
restructuring charges from prior years are primarily for facility leases. The following is a
summary of the restructuring plans, the related charges and the remaining obligations:

See Note 5 in Item 8 for a complete description of
all restructuring charges and the amounts remaining to be paid.

In-Process Research and Development

The allocation of the NetScreen purchase price included $27.5 million to in-process research
and development (“IPR&D”) and was expensed in the second quarter of 2004. Projects that qualify as
IPR&D represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no
alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta-phase
working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of
acquisition, NetScreen had multiple IPR&D efforts under way for certain current and future product
lines. These efforts included developing and integrating secure routers with embedded encryption
chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (“IP”),
wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. At the time of the
NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the
next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately $25
million. As of December 31, 2004, it was estimated that these development efforts would be
completed over the next nine months at an estimated cost of approximately $10.5 million.

The Unisphere acquisition included $82.7 million of IPR&D. These development efforts were
completed as of December 31, 2003.

- 25 -


Integration

We incurred integration expenses of approximately $5.1 million related to the NetScreen
acquisition and $2.5 million related to the Unisphere acquisition. Integration expenses are
incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies. The integration
expenses consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their
positions and professional fees.

Interest and other income decreased $5.2 million from 2003 to 2004 and $23.0 million from 2002
to 2003. Both decreases were the result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and
less realized gains, partially offset by a gain of $3.5 million during 2004 from a non-recurring
engineering contract.

Interest expense decreased $33.7 million from 2003 to 2004 and $16.5 million from 2002 to
2003, almost entirely due to interest saved from the retirement of our Subordinated Notes.

We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at
cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. We wrote-down these investments by
$2.9 million and $50.5 million in 2004 and 2002, respectively, for changes in market value that we
believed were other than temporary.

We spent $145.0 million, $792.0 million and $146.0 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, to retire our Subordinated Notes. We recognized net losses of $4.1 million and $1.1
million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. We recognized a gain of $62.9 million during 2002.
The losses and gains were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated
Notes at the time of their retirement, including unamortized debt costs, and the amount paid to
extinguish such notes.

During the first and second quarters of 2003, we sold some of our marketable equity securities
classified as available-for-sale, which had a cost basis of $4.3 million, and recognized gains of
$8.7 million.

During the second quarter of 2001, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Ericsson to
develop and market products for the wireless Internet infrastructure market. We recognized our
portion of the net loss in this joint venture with Ericsson in the amount of $1.3 million during
2002. As of December 31, 2002, we had no further capital funding obligations to this joint
venture.

Provision for income taxes increased to $83.3 million in 2004 from $19.8 million in 2003 due
to the increase in income before income taxes. The effective rates were approximately 38% and 34%
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase was primarily due to
in-process research and development expenses related to an acquisition that were not deductible for
tax purposes. The 2004 effective tax rate reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions,
the benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit from certain charges and losses. The 2003
effective rate reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of research
credits and capital loss carryforwards and the inability to benefit
from certain charges and losses.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has concluded an audit of our federal income tax returns
for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA)
from the IRS. While the final resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is uncertain, we believe
we have made adequate provisions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any
adjustments that the IRS has proposed with respect to these tax returns.

In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of our US payroll tax returns are
currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001, and we received a second NOPA in the
amount of $11.7 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing of tax
deposits related to employee stock option exercises. We intend to dispute this assessment with the
IRS and resolve the issue at the Appeals level. We currently do not believe that it is probable
that any final assessment will be sustained nor do we believe that a liability can be reasonably
estimated at this time. In the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably, there exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which an
unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

Working capital increased $485.5 million from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to cash provided by
operations of $439.4 million. The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued
liabilities and deferred revenue.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working
capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with
our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. In addition, there are no
transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons
that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements
for capital resources.

We occupy approximately 1.3 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The
majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in
Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2014.

(B)

Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2004 was our outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible
Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (“Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003
and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our
existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future
debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no
interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions,
at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion
rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances.

(C)

Our other contractual obligations consist primarily of an agreement to purchase a portfolio
of patents for $12.0 million, which was paid in January 2005. These patents will be amortized
over their useful lives, which average 12.1 years.

We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce
manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers place
non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders, which were valued at $69.9 million as of December
31, 2004, based on our build forecasts. We do not take ownership of the components and the NCNR
orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract
manufacturers. The components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on
purchase orders we have received from our customers. We do not incur a liability for products
built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customer’s order and the order ships.
However, if the components go unused, we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges. As
of December 31, 2004, we had accrued $19.0 million based on our estimate of such charges.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $439.4 million, $178.6 million and $2.4 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The cash provided by operating
activities for each period was due to our net income (loss) adjusted by:

•

non-cash charges of $100.9 million, $6.8 million and $72.8 million for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, primarily for the tax benefit of employee stock option plans,
in-process research and development from the NetScreen and Unisphere acquisitions, a loss
from the redemption of the Subordinated Notes and an impairment charge related to our
equity investments;

•

ongoing non-cash charges of $145.7 million, $70.0 million and $63.0 million for 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively, for depreciation expense and amortization expenses of
intangible assets, deferred compensation and debt costs; and

- 28 -


•

fluctuations during the normal course of business of $57.2 million, $62.5 million and
$(13.8) million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, in accounts receivable, prepaid and
other current assets, long-term assets, accounts payables, accrued liabilities and deferred
revenue.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Net cash used in investing activities was $295.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and maturities of
available-for-sale securities. Capital expenditures increased from 2003 to 2004 due to our
business growing and the NetScreen acquisition. Our capital expenditures decreased from 2002 to
2003 as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives. Investing activities include:

•

$40.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the NetScreen
acquisition during 2004,

•

$30.8 million of restricted cash funded during 2003 to establish a trust to secure our
indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers, and

•

$375.8 million paid during 2002 in connection with the Unisphere acquisition.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $33.4 million, $307.5 million and $119.4 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash was provided during all
periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase
plans. We spent $145.0 million, $792.0 million and $146.0 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, to retire our Subordinated Notes. We spent $63.6 million during 2004 to retire 2.9
million shares of our common stock. During the second quarter of 2003, we received net proceeds of
$392.8 million from the issuance of the Senior Notes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS No. 123 (“FAS 123R”),

Share-Based Payment

, which
requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar
awards. The accounting provisions of FAS 123R will be effective for us beginning in the third
quarter of fiscal 2005. We will adopt the provisions of FAS 123R using a modified prospective
application. Under modified prospective application, FAS 123R, which provides certain changes to
the method for valuing stock-based compensation among other changes, will apply to new awards and
to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled.
Compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered
as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the
compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under FAS 123 (see Note 2 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We are in the process of determining how the new
method of valuing stock-based compensation as prescribed in FAS 123R will be applied to valuing
stock-based awards granted after the effective date and the impact the recognition of compensation
expense related to such awards will have on our financial statements.

The Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF Issue No. 04-8,

The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share

(“EITF 04-8”), during September 2004. EITF 04-8
states that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable
upon occurrence of a market-price condition should be included in the calculation of diluted EPS,
regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. The EITF 04-8 consensus must be
applied by retroactive restatement based on the terms in effect and amounts outstanding on the last
day of the fiscal period in

- 29 -


which the consensus becomes effective. EITF 04-8 was effective for us
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. EITF 04-8 applied to our Senior Notes that were issued in
June 2003. The application of EITF 04-8 reduced the 2003 diluted earnings per share by one cent.
We have restated our diluted shares and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks. The
market price of our stock reflects a higher multiple of expected future earning than many other
companies. Accordingly, even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and
earnings, whether as a result of our actual financial results, acquisitions, industry changes or
other factors, could trigger significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock.
Investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors, including but
not limited to the following factors, that could affect our stock price.

We face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial
results.

Competition is intense in the markets that we address. The IP infrastructure market has
historically been dominated by Cisco Systems, Inc., with other companies such as Alcatel S.A.,
Nortel Networks Corporation and Huawei Technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the
market. In addition, a number of other small public or private companies have products or have
announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address.

In the security products market, we face intense competition from a broader group of companies
including appliance vendors such as Cisco Systems, Inc., SonicWALL, Inc., and Watchguard Technologies and
software vendors such as CheckPoint Software Technologies and Symantec Corporation. We also
compete with various emerging private companies and low-cost network hardware suppliers that may
position their products as replacements for ours.

If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis
of product offerings or price, we could experience a loss in market share and revenues and/or be
required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins, and which could materially and
adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

We rely on value-added resellers and distribution partners to sell our products, and disruptions to
or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and
procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of
our products.

Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful
relationships with a variety of value-added reseller and distribution partners. The majority of
our revenues are derived through value-added resellers and distributors, most of which also sell
competitors’ products. Our revenues depend in part on the performance of these distributors and
value-added resellers. The loss of or reduction in sales to these value-added resellers or
distributors could materially reduce our revenues. Our competitors may in some cases be effective
in incentivizing resellers or potential resellers to favor their products or to prevent or reduce
sales of our products. If we fail to maintain relationships with these distribution partners, fail
to develop new relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new markets or expand
the number of resellers in existing markets, fail to manage, train or incent existing value-added
resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales
efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer.

In addition, we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue based on a sell-through model
using information provided by our distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate
or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted.

- 30 -


Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to scale
and improve our processes and procedures that support it, and those processes and procedures may
become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage. Our failure to successfully manage
and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could
adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products.

Integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our
financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.

We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to enhance our business.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems combining the purchased operations,
technologies or products, unanticipated costs, diversion of management’s attention from our core
businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks
associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss
of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any
businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of
businesses that we have acquired has been, and will continue to be, a complex, time consuming and
expensive process. For example, although we completed the acquisition of NetScreen in April 2004,
integration of the products, product roadmap, operations, and personnel is a continuing activity
and will be for the foreseeable future. Acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock
that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders, assume liabilities, record goodwill and
non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and
potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible
assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all
of which could harm our operating results and financial condition.

In addition, if we fail in our integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a
combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures,
financial controls and human resources practices, our business and financial condition may be
adversely affected.

A limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease
in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating
results.

A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers
and distribution partners. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during 2004
and 2003. Ericsson A.B. accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during 2003 and 2002.
Any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly
decrease sales to such customers, which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of
operations. In addition, there has been and continues to be consolidation in the
telecommunications industry (for example, the recently announced planned acquisitions of AT&T and
MCI by SBC and Verizon, respectively). This consolidation may cause our customers who are involved
in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have
other unforeseen consequences.

We expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be
sustainable.

Our recent level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected
in the future by numerous factors, including product mix shifts, increased price competition in one
or more of the markets in which we compete, increases in material or labor costs, excess inventory
or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers, increased costs due to changes in
component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if our forecasts do not
accurately anticipate product demand, or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets
with different pricing and cost structures.

- 31 -


We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, which
makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face
increased challenges in supply chain management in the future.

With the current demand for electronic products, component shortages are possible and the
predictability of the availability of such components may be limited. Growth in our business and
the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project
overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels. If shortages or delays persist,
the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all. We may
not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new
products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can
be developed. We currently purchase numerous key components, including application-specific
integrated circuits (ASICs), from single or limited sources. The development of alternate sources
for those components is time consuming, difficult and costly. For example, IBM is our sole ASIC
supplier for our infrastructure products and Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. is our
sole ASIC supplier for our security products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain
components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. In the
event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers, we may not be able to
develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. If, as a result, we are unable to buy
these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not
be able to deliver product to our customers, which would seriously impact present and future sales,
which would, in turn, adversely affect our business.

In addition, the development, licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may
increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of
key components and products would adversely affect our business.

If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or
experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business.

We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers. If we overestimate our
requirements, the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess
inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. Conversely, because lead times
for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific
supplier, contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time, if we underestimate our
requirements, the contract manufacturers may have inadequate materials and components required to
produce our products, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in
shipments and deferral or loss of revenues.

We are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long-term supply contracts, and
changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that
could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships.

We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of whom is a third party manufacturer
for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with our contract
manufacturers, those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long-term basis
in any specific quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to
qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we should fail
to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should
experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations, or we
had to change or add additional contract manufacturers, our ability to ship products to our
customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or contract
manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management. For example, one of our
contract manufacturers has recently begun manufacturing in Malaysia. Each of these factors could
adversely affect our business and financial results.

The fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period
and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results.

Our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products
in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and
constrained spending

- 32 -


on network expansion has previously resulted (for example, in 2001 and 2002),
and may in the future result, in decreased revenues and earnings and could also negatively impact
our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships. Economic downturns may
also lead to restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments. In
addition, our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high
percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to be, fixed in the short-term. Uncertainty
about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make
decisions about future investments. Future economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and
reductions in spending on network expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our
products and consequently on our results of operations and stock price.

Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors, our
business could be adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in
connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services.

Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks
and, in the case of our security products, provide and monitor network security and may protect
valuable information. Our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors,
defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a
product has been installed and used by end customers. Any errors or security vulnerabilities
discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in
revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could
adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we could face claims for
product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is
costly and may divert management’s attention. In addition, if our business liability insurance
coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our
financial condition could be harmed.

If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations will be delayed or
cancelled and could harm our business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks, each of which
have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other
vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been
added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products will be required to
interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in
order to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects
in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to
fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing
software and hardware, which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results. In
addition, if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks, orders for our
products could be cancelled or our products could be returned. This could hurt our operating
results, damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects.

Traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous
terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to such customers, we may
be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business.

Traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies, because of their size,
generally have had greater purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received more
favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors.
As we seek to sell more products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to such
terms and conditions, which may include terms that affect our ability to recognize revenue and have an
adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

For example, many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who
promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality and/or had products that
caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers. As a result, this class of
customers may

- 33 -


request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to
deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be
caused by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we are required to agree to
them, may affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales, which may negatively affect
our business and our financial condition.

If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements
that meet those needs, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to
compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to
develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner.
If we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product
enhancements to meet those needs, such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and
sales of our present and future products, which would significantly harm our business and financial
results. Even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and
enhancements, there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread
market acceptance. Any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect
our business and financial results.

Our ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire
key personnel.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key
executive, engineering, sales, marketing and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified
individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas, is limited and
competition for such individuals is intense. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an
employment agreement for any specific term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees,
the inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required
personnel, particularly engineers, could delay the development and introduction of new products,
and negatively impact our ability to market, sell, or support our products.

Recent rulemaking by the Financial Accounting Standards Board will require us to expense equity
compensation given to our employees and will significantly harm our operating results and may
reduce our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees.

We historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee
compensation program in order to align employees’ interests with the interests of our stockholders,
encourage employee retention, and provide competitive compensation packages. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes that will require companies to record a charge to
earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning July 1, 2005. By
causing us to incur significantly increased compensation costs, such accounting changes will reduce
our reported earnings and will require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity
incentives provided to employees, which may make it more difficult for us to attract, retain and
motivate key personnel. Each of these results could materially and adversely affect our business.

Litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming, expensive and require a
significant amount of resources to prosecute, defend or make our products non-infringing.

Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related
to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies
and related standards that are relevant to our products. For example, in 2003, Toshiba Corporation
filed a lawsuit against us, alleging that our products infringe certain Toshiba patents. The asserted claims
and/or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or
customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products.
Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation
and may require us to develop non-infringing technologies or enter into license agreements.
Furthermore, because of the potential for high awards of damages that are not necessarily
predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money.
If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made

- 34 -


against us by any third party is
successful, if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money, or if we fail
to develop non-infringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially
reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

We are a party to lawsuits, which, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay damages
which could harm our business and financial condition.

We and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board
of directors are subject to various lawsuits. There can be no assurance that actions that have
been brought against us or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor. Regardless of
whether they are in our favor, these lawsuits are, and any future lawsuits to which we may become a
party will likely be, expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve. Such costs of defense and
any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.

The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our expectation that some
customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues and
operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

A customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of
its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the sales
cycle may be lengthy. Throughout the sales cycle, we may spend considerable time educating and
providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products.
Even after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our products slowly and
deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer,
the size of the network deployment, the complexity of the customer’s network environment and the
degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers with
large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly,
we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis. These long
cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with
short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly
from quarter to quarter.

Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology and if licenses of
third-party technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our revenues
and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time,
we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or
product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us
on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses
required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new
products and product enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower
quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

A breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products, which could
cause us to lose revenues.

If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of
our security products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market
perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. This could cause us to lose current and
potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value-added resellers and
distributors. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks
change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be
unable to anticipate these techniques.

- 35 -


Due to the global nature of our operations, economic or social conditions or changes in a
particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses,
which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.

We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through
our distributors and value-added resellers in countries outside of the United States and also
depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of
the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a
variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, political or social unrest
or economic instability in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and other
regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various
countries, service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations
and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Any or all of these factors
could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition.

Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure
our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions. Past restructuring
efforts may prove to be inadequate or may impair our ability to realize our current or future
business objectives.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market
requires an effective planning and management process to enable us to effectively scale our
business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions.
In periods of market expansion, we have increased investment in our business by, for example
increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other parts of
our business. Conversely, during 2001 and 2002, in response to downward trending industry and
market conditions, we restructured our business and reduced our workforce. In addition, we expect
that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties and
significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning
any surplus space. These changes and other similar actions taken to respond to fluctuating market
and economic conditions have placed, and our anticipated future operations will continue to place,
significant demands on our management resources. This may increase the potential likelihood of
other risks, and our business may suffer if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and
scope of our operations.

We may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in
restructuring our business in the past and, even if successfully implemented, these initiatives may
not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions. Furthermore, our
workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives.
Lastly, costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the
estimated costs of such actions and/or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings, all of which
could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our
financial results and cash flows.

Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to
adverse movements in non-US currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as
business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and
cash flows.

The majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in US Dollars. We also have some
transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, Hong Kong
Dollar, British Pound and the Euro, related to our sales and service operations outside of the
United States. An increase in the value of the US Dollar could increase the real cost to our
customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in US Dollars,
and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw
materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies.

- 36 -


Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and
liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign
currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of
currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. If our attempts to
hedge against these risks are not successful, our net income could be adversely impacted.

Our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and, as
a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could
adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a
number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock
price to fluctuate.

The factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include limited
visibility into customer spending plans, changing market conditions, including some customer and
potential customer bankruptcies, changes in the mix of products sold, long sales and implementation cycles, regional
economic and political conditions and seasonality. For example, many companies experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending
patterns, particularly in the 1st and 3rd quarters.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not
necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely that in some
future quarters, our operating results may be below one or more of the expectations of securities
analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline. Such a decline
could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and/or
earnings guidance.

If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and
processes, our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly
evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process. We will need to
continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures
in order to manage our business effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement
improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be
negatively affected.

We sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and IP infrastructure
and, if the network and IP systems do not continue to grow, then our business, operating results
and financial condition will be adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth of IP infrastructure
and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of IP
services. As a result of changes in the economy and capital spending, which have in the past
particularly affected telecommunications service providers, spending on IP infrastructure can vary,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our
revenues.

The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license
requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental agencies have proposed additional
regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of
private encryption keys. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of
imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required export approval of encryption technologies
could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues.

- 37 -


While we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we are
exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2004 requires our management to report on, and our
independent auditors to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control structure and
procedures for financial reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process
evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We expect to incur significant
expenses and management resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that
our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting
firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective
as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a
decline in the market price of our stock.

We are subject to risks arising from our international operations.

We derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations, and we plan to
continue expanding our business in international markets in the future. As a result of our
international operations, we are affected by economic, regulatory and political conditions in
foreign countries, including changes in IT spending generally, the imposition of government
controls, changes or limitations in trade protection laws, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or
laws, natural disasters, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions, misappropriation of
intellectual property, acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors,
which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations. In particular, in
some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection. Moreover, local laws and
customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. In many foreign
countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for others to engage in
business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States
regulations applicable to us. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees,
contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them. Violations of laws or key
control policies by our employees, contractors or agents could result in financial reporting
problems, fines, penalties, prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future
prospects.

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition
could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications
industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce
on IP networks. We could be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce in any
country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or
using Internet Protocol, encryption technology, and access charges for service providers. The
adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products, and at the same time increase
the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating result and financial condition.

Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or
other tax returns could adversely affect our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than
anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in
countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are
subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and
other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance
that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our
operating results and financial condition.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These
securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value
of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact
on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate
exposures.

The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments
held at December 31, 2004 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in thousands):

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The
modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes
in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve
of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the
historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

It is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in
foreign currencies. We recognize these derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair
value. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions
related to certain operating expenses, denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British
Pound. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, and have maturities between one and
two months. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange
contracts with creditworthy financial institutions.

For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s
gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and
upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of
operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the
hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
in other income/(expense) on our consolidated statement of operations.

In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that
it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated
other comprehensive income to other income/(expense) on the consolidated statement of operations at
that time. For the years

- 39 -


ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were no material net gains
or losses recognized in other income/(expense) relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that
did not occur.

Additionally, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and
losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated primarily in the Euro,
Japanese Yen and British Pound. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded
in other income/(expense). Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange contracts are
largely offset by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange
contracts have maturities between one and two months.

We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in
foreign exchange rates to the foreign exchange contracts and the underlying exposures described
above. As of December 31, 2004, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements
would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Juniper Networks
Inc.’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over the company’s financial reporting. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness
of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can
provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. Further
because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

We assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment using those criteria, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2004,
Juniper Networks Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Juniper Networks Inc.’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,
audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and have issued
an audit report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting. This report appears on page 42 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Juniper Networks, Inc. at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Juniper Networks, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March 1, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Juniper Networks, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
 unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2004 consolidated
financial statements of Juniper Networks, Inc. and our report dated
March 1, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or the “Company”) was founded in 1996 to develop
and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of service providers. Today the
Company designs and sells products and services that together provide its customers with Internet
Protocol (“IP”) secure networking solutions. The Company’s solutions are incorporated into the
global web of interconnected public and private networks across which a variety of media, including
voice, video and data, travel to and from end users around the world. The Company’s network
infrastructure solutions enable service providers and other network-intensive businesses to support
and deliver services and applications on a highly efficient and low cost integrated network. The
Company’s security solutions meet a broad array of its customer’s security priorities, from
protecting the network itself, to protecting data on the network. Together, the Company’s secure
networking solutions enable its customers to convert networks that provide commoditized, best
efforts services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation and value and increased
reliability and security to end users. The Company sells and markets its products through its
direct sales organization, value-added resellers and distributors.

In April 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Inc.
(“NetScreen”) in order to expand its customer base and portfolio of products. NetScreen developed,
marketed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises, carriers
and government entities. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 141,

Business Combinations

, the Company has included in its results of operations the results
of NetScreen beginning on April 16, 2004; therefore, revenues, cost of revenues and operating
expenses are significantly greater during 2004 compared to 2003 and 2002.

As a result of the NetScreen acquisition, the Company expanded its customer base and portfolio
of products, and now offer two categories of networking products: infrastructure products, which
consist predominately of the original Juniper Networks products, and security products, which
consist predominately of the former NetScreen products.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Juniper Networks and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Investments
in operating companies in which the Company does not have a controlling interest and does not have
the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or estimated
realizable value.

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”), was issued in January 2003. FIN 46 requires that if an
entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and
results of operations of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated
financial statements of the entity. FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“FIN 46(R)”), was issued in December 2003 and revised parts of FIN 46. The
Company adopted FIN 46(R) effective January 1, 2004. The Company does not have any interests in
VIEs.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to conform to the
current year’s presentation. Specifically, deferred revenue and restructuring liabilities have
been reclassified between short-term and long-term amounts.

- 48 -


Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Company to
establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies include:

The Company has other important accounting policies and practices; however, once adopted,
these other policies either generally do not require the Company to make significant estimates or
assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to
the policy itself. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and also on
assumptions that it believes are standard and reasonable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Juniper Networks considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of 90 days
or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, commercial paper,
government securities, certificates of deposit, and corporate debt securities.

Equity Investments

Juniper Networks has certain minority equity investments in privately held companies. These
investments are included in other long-term assets and are carried at cost, adjusted for any
impairment, as the Company does not have a controlling interest and does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence over these companies. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
carrying values of the Company’s minority equity investments in privately held companies were $3.8
million and $5.7 million, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the market
for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage at the time of
the investment by Juniper Networks and such markets may never be significant. The Company monitors
these investments for impairment by considering financial, operational and economic data and makes
appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

In addition to the equity investments in privately held companies, the Company held certain
marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale. During 2003, the Company sold most
of these investments, which had a cost basis of approximately $4.3 million, and recognized a gain
of approximately $8.7 million.

The following table summarizes the impairment charges associated with equity investments
recorded by the Company (in thousands):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable
approximates fair market value due to the relatively short period of time to maturity. See Note 6
“Cash Equivalents, Short-Term and Long-Term Investments and Restricted Cash” for a discussion of
the carrying values of our investment portfolio. The fair values of the Zero Coupon Convertible
Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (the “Senior Notes”) are based upon quoted market rates. See Note 7
“Long-Term Debt” for further discussion on the Company’s outstanding debt.

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject Juniper Networks to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and trade accounts receivable. Juniper
Networks maintains its cash and cash equivalents and investments in fixed income securities with
high-quality institutions and only invests in high quality credit instruments. Deposits held with
banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may
be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk.

Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of
entities comprising the Company’s customer base and their dispersion across different geographic
locations throughout the world. Juniper Networks performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. Juniper Networks
maintains reserves for potential credit losses and historically such losses have been within
management’s expectations. One customer accounted for 15% of total net revenues during 2004. Two
customers individually accounted for 15% and 13% of total net revenues in 2003. For 2002, one
customer accounted for 17% of net product revenues. See Note 12 “Segment Information” for a breakdown
of net revenues by geographic location.

Juniper Networks relies on sole suppliers for certain of its components such as ASICs and
custom sheet metal. Additionally, Juniper Networks relies primarily on two independent contract
manufacturers for the production of all of its products. The inability of any supplier or
manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of Juniper Networks could negatively impact future
operating results.

Derivatives

It is the Company’s policy to use derivatives to partially offset its market exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currencies. In accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”), the Company recognizes these derivatives
on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company does not enter into derivatives for
speculative or trading purposes.

The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted
transactions related to certain operating expenses, denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese
Yen, and British Pound. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No.
133, and have maturities between one and two months.

For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently
reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations line item to which the hedged
transaction relates. The Company records any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which
was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, in other
income/(expense) on its consolidated statements of operations.

In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable
that it will not occur, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the related cash flow
hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income/(expense) on the consolidated

- 50 -


statements of operations at that time. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
there were no material net gains or losses recognized in other income/(expense) relating to
hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.

Additionally, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction
gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated primarily in the
Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes
recorded in other income/(expense). Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely
offset by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts
have maturities between one and two months.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to US dollars using exchange rates
in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange
rates for the period. Foreign currency translation gains and losses were not material for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life, generally
three to five years, or the lease term of the respective assets. The land that was acquired in
January 2001 is not being depreciated. Property and equipment consist of the following (in
thousands):

$

244,491

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated
amortization. The Company adopted SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, on January 1,
2002, which prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives. For business combinations consummated before July 1, 2001, goodwill was amortized through
December 31, 2001 using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years.
Goodwill was not amortized for business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001. Goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for
impairment.

Amortization of purchased intangibles with finite useful lives is computed using the
straight-line method over the expected useful life of two to seven years. See Note 3, “Business
Acquisitions,” for detail of the acquisitions where the Company acquired goodwill and intangible
assets and Note 4, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets,” for detail of the activity in these
accounts during 2004 and 2003.

- 51 -


Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured,
unless it has future obligations for such things as customer acceptance, in which case revenue and
related costs are deferred until those obligations are met. In most cases, the Company recognizes
product revenue upon shipment to its customers, including value-added resellers (“VAR”), as it is
the Company’s practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a VAR. The Company defers
revenues on sales to its distributors until it has information indicating that the distributor has
sold the products to its customers.

The Company recognizes revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably
over the period of the obligation. A majority of its service revenue is earned from customers who
purchase the Company’s products and enter into service contracts. Service contracts are typically
for one-year renewable periods and are for services such as 24-hour customer support, non-specified
updates and hardware repairs. In addition to service contracts, the Company also provides
professional and educational services.

On arrangements where products and services are bundled, the Company determines whether the
deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting. The Company allocates the total fee
on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or
using the residual method, as circumstances dictate. The Company then recognizes revenue on each
deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition.

The Company accrues for sales returns and other allowances based on its best estimate of
future returns and other allowances. Although its arrangements with end-users and VARs generally
do not include any contractual rights of return, and the general
policy is that it does not accept
returns, under unique circumstances the Company has accepted, and may in the future accept, product
returns from its customers.

In addition, the Company’s agreements with distributors provide for limited stock rotation and
price protection rights. Stock rotation rights provide distributors with the right to exchange
unsold inventory for alternate products of equal or greater value. Price protection rights grant
distributors the right to a credit on certain purchases in the event of decreases in the prices of
its products. The Company accrues for these credits based on its estimates of expected stock
rotation and price protection obligations.

The Company’s resellers and distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and
other programs, and it maintains estimated accruals and allowances for these programs.

Amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue and accounts
receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Below is a breakdown of the Company’s
deferred revenue (in thousands):

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectibility
of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as
historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic
conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.

Research and Development

Costs to develop the Company’s products are expensed as incurred in accordance with SFAS No.
2,

Accounting for Research and Development Costs

, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for research and development.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred and the totals have
been insignificant to date.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has employee stock benefit plans, which are described more fully in Note 10,
“Stockholders’ Equity.” The Company’s stock option plans are accounted for under the intrinsic
value recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

, and related interpretations. As the exercise price of all options granted under these
plans was equal to the market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date, no
stock-based employee compensation cost, other than acquisition-related compensation cost, was
recognized in net income. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings
per share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, to employee stock benefits, including shares issued under
the stock option plans and under the Company’s Stock Purchase Plan. Pro forma information, net of

Provision for Income Taxes

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the
determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
differences and carryforwards. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax
assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based
on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, and records a
valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes to be more
likely than not realizable. Accordingly, a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the U.S.
domestic net deferred tax assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future
realization of these assets, in part, due to the potential impact of future stock option
deductions. In addition, the calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes potential
liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be
due.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS No. 123 (“FAS 123R”),

Share-Based Payment

, which
requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar
awards. The accounting provisions of FAS 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in the
third quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company will adopt the provisions of FAS 123R using a modified
prospective application. Under modified prospective application, FAS 123R, which provides certain
changes to the method for valuing stock-based compensation among other changes, will apply to new
awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or
cancelled. Compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not
been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using
the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under FAS 123. The Company is
in the process of determining how the new method of valuing stock-based compensation as prescribed
in FAS 123R will be applied to valuing stock-based awards granted after the effective date and the
impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on its financial
statements.

The Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF Issue No. 04-8 (“EITF 04-8”),

The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share

, during September 2004. EITF 04-8
states that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently
exercisable upon occurrence of a market-price condition should be included in the calculation of
diluted EPS, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. The EITF 04-8 consensus
must be applied retroactively based on the terms in effect and amounts outstanding on the last day
of the fiscal period in which the consensus becomes effective. EITF 04-8 was effective for the
Company beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. EITF 04-8 applied to the Company’s Senior Notes
that were issued in June 2003. The application of EITF 04-8 reduced the 2003 diluted earnings per
share by one cent and, accordingly, the Company has restated its diluted shares and earnings per
share for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Note 3. Business Acquisitions

Juniper Networks allocates the purchase price of its business acquisitions to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as in-process research and development,
based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded
as goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed are based on estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other information
compiled by management, including valuations that utilize established valuation techniques
appropriate for the high technology industry.

NetScreen Technologies, Inc.

In April 2004, Juniper Networks completed its acquisition of NetScreen. The acquisition
resulted in the issuance of approximately 132 million shares of the Company’s common stock with a
fair value of approximately $3,651.2 million to the former stockholders of NetScreen. The common
stock issued in the acquisition was valued using the average closing price of the Company’s common
stock over a five-day trading period beginning two days before and ending two days after the date
the transaction was announced. Juniper Networks also assumed all of the outstanding NetScreen
stock options with a fair value of approximately $520.5 million. The options were valued using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the inputs of 0.8 for volatility, 3 years for expected
life, 2.5% for the risk-free interest rate and a market value of Juniper Networks common stock of
$27.64 per share, which was determined as described above. The Company also incurred direct costs
associated with the acquisition of approximately $13.4 million. Below is a summary of the total
purchase price (in millions):

The purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to change if the Company obtains
additional information concerning the fair values of certain tangible assets and liabilities of
NetScreen. After the initial purchase price allocation during the second quarter of 2004, the
Company decreased the net tangible assets acquired and increased goodwill by $6.1 million. The
change was due to the recognition of a preacquisition contingency of $12.0 million related to an
earn-out payable to the shareholders of Neoteris Inc., a company purchased by NetScreen during
November 2003, partially offset by a number of reductions in the valuation of certain
preacquisition accruals. There is an additional potential $18.0 million earn-out related to the
Neoteris acquisition that may be paid in the event certain financial milestones are achieved.

Goodwill recorded as a result of this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

- 55 -


Acquisition Costs Related to The NetScreen Acquisition

The Company accrued for acquisition charges of $21.3 million primarily related to severance
and facility charges. The Company recognized these costs in accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with Purchase Business Combinations

(“EITF 95-3”).
Ninety-four former NetScreen employees were identified for termination at the time of the
acquisition all related severance has been paid. The remaining restructuring change consists
primarily of facility charges that will be paid through the end of
the lease terms, which extend through 2008. As of December 31, 2004, $12.6 million remained
to be paid, of which $8.2 million is recorded in other long-term liabilities.

Amortizable Intangible Assets

Existing technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and
includes products in NetScreen’s product line, principally the VPN and firewall appliances.
Existing technology was valued using the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. This method
calculates the value of the intangible asset as being the present value of the after tax cash flows
potentially attributable to it, net of the return on fair value attributable to tangible and other
intangible assets. Juniper Networks is amortizing the fair value of the existing technology on a
straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of four years.

Maintenance agreements represent the revenue generated by contracts with customers who pay for
annual maintenance and support. The income approach was used to estimate the fair value of the
maintenance agreements, which includes estimating the ongoing, after-tax income expected from
maintenance agreements in place at the time of the NetScreen acquisition, including expected
renewals. Juniper Networks is amortizing the fair value of the maintenance agreements on a
straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of five years.

Patents and core technology represent a combination of processes, patents, and trade secrets
that were used for existing and in-process technology. The value of the trade name and trademarks
is represented by the benefit of owning these intangible assets rather than paying royalties for
their use. Both of these intangible assets were valued using the royalty savings method. This
method estimates the value of these intangible assets by capitalizing the royalties saved because
the Company owns the assets. Juniper Networks is amortizing the fair value of these assets over
the remaining estimated useful life of four years on a straight-line basis.

Relationships with VARs and distributors represent the rights granted to the VAR or
distributor to resell certain NetScreen products. NetScreen had distributors located in North
America, Latin America, the Asia Pacific region and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The
VAR and distributor relationships were valued using the avoided cost method, which takes into
account the cost of establishing each relationship. Juniper Networks is amortizing the VAR
relationships over five years on a straight-line basis and the distributor relationships over seven
years on a straight-line basis. The difference in the estimated useful lives between VARs and
distributors is attributed to the longer historical lives of the distributor relationships.

Order backlog represents the value of the standing orders for both products and services. The
order backlog was valued using the avoided cost method, which estimates the avoided selling
expenses due to the fact that NetScreen had firm purchase orders in place at the time of
acquisition. Juniper Networks amortized the fair value of these assets over the three-month period
ended June 30, 2004 to cost of revenues.

In-process Research and Development

Of the total purchase price, $27.5 million has been allocated to in-process research and
development (“IPR&D”) and was expensed in the three months ended June 30, 2004. Projects that
qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have
no alternative future use.

- 56 -


Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a
beta-phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At
the time of acquisition, NetScreen had multiple IPR&D efforts under way for certain current and
future product lines. These efforts included developing and integrating secure routers with
embedded encryption chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet
Protocol (“IP”), wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability.
The Company utilized the DCF method to value the IPR&D, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%,
depending on the estimated useful life of the technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of
the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected
to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated, over the remaining
economic life of the technology. To distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the
underlying technology and the cash
flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues, adjustments were
made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working capital, and other assets that provide
value to the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these
development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of
approximately $25 million. As of December 31, 2004, it was estimated that these development
efforts would be completed over the next nine months at an estimated cost of approximately $10.5
million.

Deferred Compensation

Unvested stock options and restricted stock valued at $93.5 million at the time of the
NetScreen acquisition have been allocated to deferred compensation in the purchase price allocation
and are being amortized to expense using the graded-vesting method. The intrinsic value of the
unvested stock options and restricted stock was adjusted by the percent assumed to have been
expensed from the grant date to the acquisition date using the graded-vesting method. Options
assumed in conjunction with the acquisition had exercise prices ranging from $0.09 to $27.11 per
share, with a weighted average exercise price of $12.48 per share and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of approximately 8 years. Juniper Networks assumed approximately 5.9 million
vested options and approximately 20.5 million unvested options and restricted stock.

Pro Forma Results

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of
operations of Juniper Networks and NetScreen as if the acquisition had occurred as of the
beginning of the periods presented. The information in the 2004 unaudited amounts was derived
from the audited statement of operations of Juniper Networks for the year ended December 31,
2004 and the unaudited statement of operations of NetScreen for the three and a half months
ended April 15, 2004. The information in the 2003 unaudited amounts was derived from the
audited statements of operations of Juniper Networks for the year ended December 31, 2003 and
the audited statement of operations of NetScreen for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003.
Adjustments of $0.6 million and $86.8 million have been made to the combined results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflecting the
elimination of amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation, charges
to cost of goods sold for inventory write-ups and the valuation of the order backlog, IPR&D and
the net tax impact. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended to represent
or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations of Juniper Networks that would have
been reported had the acquisition been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be
taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations of the Company.

Amortizable
Intangible Assets

Of the total purchase price, approximately $74.0 million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets, including completed
technology, service contract relationships, non-compete agreements and order backlog. Completed technology, which consisted of
products that had reached technological feasibility, included products in Unisphere’s product line, principally the ERX product.
Service contract relationships represented the potential additional source of revenue from customers with existing service
contracts. Both completed technology and the service contract relationships were valued using the discounted cash flow (DCF)
method. Juniper Networks is amortizing the fair value of the completed technology and service contract relationships on a
straight-line basis over weighted average remaining useful lives of approximately five years and six years, respectively.

Non-compete agreements represented the value of the non-compete and non-solicit agreements signed by key executives from
Unisphere. The non-compete agreements were valued using the lost profits method, which estimates the value of the future cash flows
that would be lost due to customer defections. The non-solicit agreements were valued using the avoided cost method, which
estimates the avoided costs of replacing solicited employees. Juniper Networks is amortizing the fair value of these assets on a
straight-line basis over a weighted average useful life of approximately two years.

Order backlog represented the value of the standing orders for both products and services. The order backlog was valued using
the avoided cost method, which estimates the avoided selling expenses

- 58 -


due to the fact that Unisphere had firm purchase orders in place at the time of
acquisition. Juniper Networks amortized the fair value of these assets over the three-month period
ended September 30, 2002 to cost of product revenues.

In-process Research and Development

Of the total purchase price, approximately $82.7 million was allocated to in-process research
and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the quarter ended September 30, 2002. At the time of
acquisition, Unisphere had multiple IPR&D efforts under way for certain current and future product
lines. These efforts included developing new cards and modules for different bandwidths and various
software developments. These development efforts were completed as of December 31, 2003.

Deferred Compensation

Unvested stock options with an intrinsic value of approximately $0.5 million at the time of
acquisition was allocated to deferred compensation in the purchase price allocation and are being
amortized to expense using the graded vesting method. Options assumed in conjunction with the
acquisition had exercise prices ranging from $5.65 to $14.73 per share, with a weighted average
exercise price of $5.81 per share and a weighted average remaining contractual life of
approximately 9 years. Juniper Networks assumed approximately 13.5 million vested options and
approximately 12.5 million unvested options.

Acquisition Costs Related to The Unisphere Acquisition

Juniper Networks recorded $14.8 million of similar restructuring costs in connection with the
restructuring of the Unisphere organization in the third quarter of 2002. These costs were
accounted for under EITF 95-3, recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business
combination and included in the allocation of the cost to acquire Unisphere as an increase to
goodwill. During 2004, the Company adjusted this liability by $3.7 million primarily for changes
in it sublease assumptions and recorded the adjustment as a credit to

Restructuring and other

in
the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2004, there was $1.4 million
remaining to be paid, primarily for facilities that will be paid over the respective lease terms
through 2014, and professional services.

there was no impairment of the goodwill at that time.

Note 5. Restructuring and Other Operating Charges

The following restructuring charges are based on Juniper Networks’ restructuring plans that
have been committed to by management. Any changes to the estimates of executing the approved plans
will be reflected in Juniper Networks’ results of operations.

Restructuring In Connection With The NetScreen Acquisition

In the three months ended June 30, 2004, in connection with the NetScreen acquisition, the
Company recorded a restructuring charge of $0.4 million for the termination of 13 employees to
eliminate certain duplicative activities. These employees were from all functions and all
geographic theaters and were in addition to the 94 former NetScreen employees that were also
terminated. These charges were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

(“SFAS 146”). All severance payments were made as of
September 30, 2004.

Restructuring In Connection With The Discontinuance Of The CMTS Products

In the third quarter of 2003, the Company announced that it would no longer develop its
G-series CMTS products and recorded a charge of $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce
reduction costs, an asset impairment charge, costs associated with vacating facilities, costs
associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. These charges are accounted for
in accordance with SFAS 146.

The Company has paid all of the severance related to the workforce reduction related primarily
to the termination of 76 employees that were mainly located in the Americas and Europe regions.
The asset impairment charge was primarily for long-lived assets that were no longer needed as a
result of the Company’s decision to cease further development of the G-series CMTS product line.
Facility charges consisted primarily of the cost of vacating facilities that were dedicated to the
development of the G-series CMTS products and the impairment cost of certain leasehold
improvements. The net present value of the facility charge was calculated using the Company’s
risk-adjusted borrowing rate.

-60-


Amounts related to the net facility charge are included in other
accrued liabilities and will be paid over the respective lease term through July 2008. The
difference between the actual future rent payments and the net present value will be recorded as
operating expenses when incurred. Other contractual commitments and other charges consisted
primarily of carrying and obsolete material charges from the Company’s contract manufacturers and
suppliers for on-hand and on-order material related to the G-series CMTS products and costs to
satisfy end-of-life commitments in certain customer contracts. All of these costs were included as
a charge to the results of operations in the quarter ended September 30, 2003.

As a result of the NetScreen acquisition, a portion of the facilities that was originally
included in this restructuring was needed to combine the operations of Juniper Networks and
NetScreen. As a result, we adjusted the restructuring reserve during 2004 by a net $0.9 million as a credit to

Restructuring and other

in the consolidated statement of operations.

Restructuring In Connection With The Unisphere Acquisition

During the third quarter of 2002, in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Unisphere,
Juniper Networks initiated plans to restructure operations to eliminate certain duplicative
activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align
product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions. Consequently, Juniper
Networks recorded restructuring expenses associated primarily with workforce related costs, costs
of vacating duplicative facilities, contract termination costs, non-inventory asset impairment
charges and other associated costs. The costs associated with the restructuring program totaled
$14.9 million and were included as a charge to the results of operations during 2002. These costs
were accounted for under EITF Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity

. During 2004, the Company adjusted this
reserve by $0.9 million primarily for changes in its sublease assumptions and recorded the
adjustment as a credit to

Restructuring and other

in the consolidated statement of operations. The
Company’s estimated costs to exit these facilities were based on available commercial rates for
potential subleases. As of December 31, 2004, $1.2 million was remaining to be paid, entirely for
leases of consolidated facilities that will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2009.

The Company recognized realized gains (losses) from the sale of available-for-sale securities
of $(0.3) million, $12.0 million and $0.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The gain
in 2002 is net of a $5.0 million impairment charge on available-for-sale securities recognized in
the quarter ended September 30, 2002 for declines in value that were deemed to be other than
temporary. The cost of a security sold is based on the specific identification method.

The Company had restricted cash of $31.2 million as of December 31, 2004 related to the
establishment of a trust in the amount of $25.0 million and lines of credits for facility leases.
The Company established a trust to secure its indemnification obligations to certain directors and
officers arising from their activities as such in the event that the Company does not provide or is
financially incapable of providing indemnification.

Note 7. Long-Term Debt

During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company paid $145.0 million, $792.0 million and $146.0
million, respectively, to retire its outstanding 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15,
2007. These retirements resulted in a net loss of $4.1 million during 2004, a net loss of $1.1
million during 2003 and a net gain of $62.9 million during 2002. The loss or gain represents the
difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of their retirement,
including unamortized debt issuance costs, and the amount paid to extinguish such Subordinated
Notes.

In June 2003, Juniper Networks received $392.8 million of net proceeds from an offering of
$400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008
(the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of
payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of
the Company’s existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the
notes. The Senior Notes are convertible into shares of Juniper Networks common stock, subject to
certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks.
The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

Note 8. Warranties

Juniper Networks generally offers a one-year warranty on all of its hardware products and a
90-day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. The warranty
generally includes parts and labor obtained through the Company’s 24-hour service center. On
occasion, the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary. The Company accrues for
warranty costs based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under its warranty obligations,
including material costs, technical support labor costs and associated overhead. The warranty
accrual is included in the Company’s cost of revenues and is recorded at the time revenue is
recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of installed
units, its estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims, costs per claim and estimated support
labor costs and the associated overhead. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of our
recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

Stock Option Plans

Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan (the “1996 Plan”) provides for the
granting of incentive stock options to employees and nonstatutory stock options to employees,
directors and consultants. Incentive stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less
than the fair value per share of the common stock on the date of grant. Nonstatutory stock options
may be granted at an exercise price of not less than 85% of the fair value per share on the date of
grant; however, no nonstatutory stock options have been granted for less than fair market value on
the date of grant. Vesting and exercise provisions are determined by the Board of Directors or a
committee of the Board of Directors. Options granted under the 1996 Plan generally become
exercisable over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996
Plan have a maximum term of ten years. Options granted to consultants are in consideration for the
fair value of services previously rendered, are not contingent upon future events and are expensed
in the period of grant. Juniper Networks has authorized 164,623,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the 1996 Plan. At December 31, 2004, 34,210,000 shares were available for future
option grants or stock sales under the 1996 Plan.

The 1996 Plan also provides for the sale of shares of common stock to employees and
consultants. Shares issued to consultants are for the fair value of services previously rendered
and are not contingent upon future events. Shares sold to employees are made pursuant to restricted
stock purchase agreements containing provisions established by the Board of Directors or a
committee of the Board of Directors. These provisions give Juniper Networks the right to repurchase
the shares at the original sales price upon termination of the employee. This right expires at a
rate determined by the Board of Directors, generally at the rate of 25% after one year and 2.0833%
per month thereafter. At December 31, 2003, zero shares were subject to repurchase rights under
the 1996 Plan. At December 31, 2003, 3,905,000 shares had been repurchased under the 1996 Plan in
connection with employee terminations. No shares of restricted stock were issued under the 1996
Plan in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan

In July 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the Juniper Networks 2000 Nonstatutory Stock
Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”). The 2000 Plan provides for the granting of nonstatutory stock
options to employees, directors and consultants. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted at an
exercise price of not less than 85% of the fair value per share on the date of grant; however, no
nonstatutory stock options have been granted for less than fair market value on the date of grant.
Vesting and exercise provisions are determined by the Board of Directors or a committee of the
Board of Directors. Options granted under

-64-


the 2000 Plan generally become exercisable over a
four-year period beginning on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2000 Plan have a maximum
term of ten years. Options granted to consultants are in consideration for the fair value of
services previously rendered, are not contingent upon future events and are expensed in the period
of grant. As of December 31, 2004, Juniper Networks had authorized 63,875,000 shares of common
stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan. At December 31, 2004, 28,190,000 shares were available for
future option grants under the 2000 Plan.

Plans Assumed Upon Acquisition

In connection with the acquisitions it has made since 2000, the Company has assumed options
under the plans of the acquired companies, exchanged those options for Juniper Networks options and
authorized the appropriate number of shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to those options.
As of December 31, 2004, there was approximately 23,381,000 shares outstanding under plans assumed
through acquisitions.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In April 1999, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of Juniper Networks 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”). The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to acquire
shares of the Company’s common stock through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10% of base
compensation. Each employee may purchase no more than 6,000 shares in any twelve-month period, and
in no event, may an employee purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock, determined at the fair
market value of the shares at the time such option is granted, in one calendar year. The Purchase
Plan is implemented in a series of offering periods, each six months in duration. The price at
which the common stock may be purchased is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the
respective offering period.

During 2004, employees purchased 769,000 shares of common stock through the Purchase Plan at
an average exercise price of $15.39 per share. As of December 31, 2004, a total of 3,831,000
shares had been issued under the Purchase Plan at an average price of $7.95 per share, and
8,169,000 shares remained available for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has elected to follow APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
employee stock-based compensation plans. Because the exercise price of the Company’s employee
stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation
expense is recognized, other than acquisition-related compensation costs.

The Company has disclosed the pro forma fair value stock-based compensation information
required by SFAS 123 in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The fair value of
each option granted or assumed through December 31, 2004 was estimated on the date of grant or date
of assumption using the minimum value (before the Company went public) or the Black-Scholes method.
The following shows the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the Company’s stock-based
awards:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The Black-Scholes
model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility.

During the three months ended September 30, 2004, the Company changed its method of estimating
the volatility of its common stock, which it believes provides a more thorough and accurate
forecast. The Company currently estimates volatility by considering the volatility of publicly
traded options to purchase its common stock, its outstanding convertible debentures and historical
stock volatility. Prior to the three months ended September 30, 2004, the Company estimated its
future volatility solely based on historical stock volatility. Estimating volatility is one of the
inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options granted from the
Company’s stock plans and Stock Purchase Plan.

The weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2004, 2003,
and 2002 was $11.57, $8.17, and $4.85 per share, respectively. The weighted average estimated fair
value of shares granted under the Purchase Plan during 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $4.44, $3.08 and
$10.44, respectively.

Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

At December 31, 2004, Juniper Networks had reserved an aggregate of approximately 179,648,000
shares of common stock for future issuance under all its Stock Option Plans, the 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and for future issuance upon conversion of convertible senior notes.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

During July 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a new program to
repurchase up to $250.0 million of the Company’s common stock. During 2004, the Company
repurchased and retired 2.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $22.17 per
share for an aggregate purchase price of $63.6 million. The program may be discontinued at any
time.

Note 11. 401(k) Plan

Juniper Networks maintains a savings and retirement plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. All employees are eligible to participate on their
first day of employment with Juniper Networks. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to 60%
of their pretax salaries per year but not more than the statutory limits. Beginning January 1,
2001 Juniper Networks began matching employee contributions. The matching formula was $0.50 on the
dollar up to 6% of eligible pay (up to an annual maximum of $2,000). All matching contributions
vest immediately. The Company’s matching contributions to the plan totaled $3.1 million, $2.0
million and $2.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Note 12. Segment Information

An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business
activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses and about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s CODM reviews
financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information
about revenues by geographic theater and by categories of similar products for purposes of making
operating decisions and assessing financial performance. For purposes of allocating resources, the
Company evaluates the performance of its geographic theaters and its product categories based only
on revenues. The Company does not assess the performance of its geographic theaters or categories
of networking products on other measures of income or expenses. Accordingly, the Company operates
as one operating segment. Below are the Company’s net revenues by geographic theater (in
millions):

As a result of the NetScreen acquisition, the Company expanded its customer base and portfolio
of products, and now offers two categories of networking products: infrastructure products, which
consist predominately of the original Juniper Networks products, and security products, which
consist predominately of the former NetScreen products. The Company’s service revenue is generated
by services delivered to both categories of products and is managed as one organization; therefore
the results of the service organization are reported as one amount in the Statements of Operations.
Net product revenues by categories of networking products are as follows (in millions):

For 2002, Juniper Networks excluded 11,510,000 common stock equivalents consisting of
outstanding stock options and shares subject to repurchase from the calculation of diluted loss per
share because all such securities are antidilutive in that period due to the net loss. Employee
stock options to purchase approximately 11,833,000 shares, 13,065,000 shares and 41,271,000 shares
in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the stock options was greater than the
average share price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive.

Shares issuable upon conversion of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008
(the “Senior Notes”) were included in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in accordance with EITF Issue No. 04-8,

The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share

(“EITF 04-8”). EITF 04-8 required
retroactive application; therefore the diluted earnings per share for 2003 have been restated.

assets of approximately $207.8 million, of which approximately $169.8 million relates to the tax
benefits of stock option deductions that will be credited to equity when realized. The remaining
balance of $38.0 million relates to capital losses that will carry forward to offset future capital
gains.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards
of approximately $299.9 million and $278.4 million, respectively. The Company also had federal and
state tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $56.9 million and $54.5 million, respectively.
Unused net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry-forwards will expire at
various dates beginning in the years 2021 and 2022, respectively.

The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the
subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. At
December 31, 2004, the Company has unrecognized deferred tax liabilities of approximately $20.1
million related to approximately $55.8 million of cumulative net undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. These earnings are considered indefinitely invested in operations outside of the
U.S., as we intend to utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of our international
operations.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for a
temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during either
fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2005. Juniper did not elect this provision in fiscal 2004; therefore the
period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is fiscal 2005. The deduction would
result in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. To qualify for the
deduction, the earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment
plan established by the Company’s chief executive officer and approved by the Company’s board of
directors. Certain other criteria in the Act must be satisfied as well.

Note 15. Contingencies

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business, such as employment or intellectual property claims, including the matters described
below. The outcome of any such matters is currently not determinable. An adverse result in one or

more matters could negatively affect our results in the period in which they occur.

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG
Cowen Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase (Hambrecht & Quist
LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Company and certain of
the Company’s officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s common
stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999 and its secondary offering in September
1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which
shares of common stock were sold in the Company’s initial public offering and its subsequent
secondary offering contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the
practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation of shares of common stock in these
offerings and their receipt of commissions from customers related to such allocations. Various
plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar allegations concerning the initial public offerings
of approximately 300 other issuers. These various cases pending in the Southern District of New
York have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as In re Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the
action against the Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

-70-


Defendants in the coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October
2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the case without prejudice pursuant to a
stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to
dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims against the Company.

In June 2004, a stipulation for the settlement and release of claims against the issuers,
including the Company, was submitted to the Court for preliminary approval. The terms of the
settlement, if approved, would dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants
(including the Company). In exchange for this dismissal, Directors and Officers insurance carriers
would agree to guarantee a recovery by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants of at least
$1 billion, and the issuer defendants would agree to an assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs
of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters. The settlement is
subject to a number of conditions, including certification of a class for settlement purposes and
formal court approval. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation continues, the Company
believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the case vigorously.

Federal Securities Class Action Suit

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, a number of essentially identical shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against the Company and certain of its officers and former officers purportedly on
behalf of those stockholders who purchased the Company’s publicly traded securities between April
12, 2001 and June 7, 2001. In April 2002, the court granted the defendants’ motion to consolidate
all of these actions into one; in May 2002, the court appointed the lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of lead counsel and a consolidated
complaint was filed in August 2002. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false and
misleading statements, assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seek
unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. In September 2002, the defendants moved to
dismiss the consolidated complaint. In March 2003, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss
with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint in April 2003 and the defendants
moved to dismiss the amended complaint in May 2003. The hearing on defendants’ motion to dismiss
was held in September 2003. In March 2004, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss, without
leave to amend. In April 2004, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. The appeal has been fully
briefed by the parties. The Court of Appeals has not yet scheduled arguments on the appeal.

State Derivative Claim Based on the Federal Securities Class Action Suit

In August 2002, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint purportedly filed on
behalf of the Company, captioned In re Juniper Networks, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Civil Action
No. CV 807146, was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara.
The complaint alleges that certain of the Company’s officers and directors breached their fiduciary
duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct including conduct complained of in
the securities litigation described above. The Company is named solely as a nominal defendant
against whom the plaintiffs seek no recovery. After having their previous complaints dismissed
with leave to amend, Plaintiffs lodged a third amended complaint in August 2004. Defendants
demurred to the third amended complaint. On November 18, 2004, the Court sustained defendants’
demurrer without leave to amend and entered an order of final judgment against plaintiffs. In
January 2005, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from this ruling. There has not yet been any
briefing or argument on appeal.

Toshiba Patent Infringement Litigation

On November 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit in the United States District Court in
Delaware against the Company, alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe four Toshiba
patents, and seeking an injunction and unspecified damages. There has been limited discovery to
date.

IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustments

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has concluded an audit of the Company’s federal income tax
returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004, the Company received a Notice of Proposed
Adjustment (“NOPA”) from the IRS. While the final resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is
uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for any adjustments that the IRS has proposed with respect to these tax
returns.

In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of the Company’s US payroll tax returns
are currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 — 2001, and the Company received a second
NOPA in the amount of $11.7 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing
of tax deposits related to employee stock option exercises. The Company intends to dispute this
assessment with the IRS and resolve the issue at the Appeals level. The Company currently does not
believe that it is probable that any final assessment will be sustained nor does it believe that a
liability can be reasonably estimated at this time. In the event that this issue is resolved
unfavorably to the Company, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the
Company’s results of operations for the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and
reasonably estimable.

The 2004 quarterly results reflect the impact of the acquisition of NetScreen in the second
quarter and the ongoing effects of its operations for the remainder of the year. Basic and diluted
net losses per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented, therefore, the
sum of the quarters may not be equal to the full year net loss per share amounts. In addition, the
diluted earnings per share have been restated to include the shares issuable upon conversion of the
Senior Notes in accordance with EITF 04-8.
