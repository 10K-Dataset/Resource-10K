PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

We design, develop, and sell innovative products and services
    that together provide our customers with high-performance
    network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted
    environments for accelerating the deployment of services and
    applications over a single network. We serve the
    high-performance networking requirements of global service
    providers, enterprises, and public sector organizations that
    view the network as critical to their success. We believe we are
    uniquely positioned in the networking industry based on our core
    competencies in architecture, silicon design, and our open

cross-network

software platform that includes the
    Junos

®

operating system (“Junos OS”), Junos Space network
    application platform, and Junos Pulse integrated network client.
    We offer a broad product portfolio that spans routing,
    switching, security, application acceleration, identity policy
    and control, and management designed to provide performance,
    choice, and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of
    ownership. In addition, through strong industry partnerships, we
    are fostering innovation across the network.

Our operations are organized into two reportable segments:
    Infrastructure and Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”).
    Our Infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable routing and
    switching products that are used to control and direct network
    traffic from the core, through the edge, aggregation, and the
    customer premise equipment level. Infrastructure products
    include our Internet Protocol (“IP”) routing and
    carrier Ethernet routing portfolio, as well as our Ethernet
    switching portfolio. Our SLT segment offers solutions that meet
    a broad array of our customers’ priorities, from protecting
    the network itself, and protecting data on the network, to
    maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications
    across a distributed network. Both segments offer worldwide
    services, including technical support and professional services,
    as well as educational and training programs to our customers.
    Together, our high-performance product and service offerings
    help enable our customers to convert legacy networks that
    provide commoditized, services into more valuable assets that
    provide differentiation and value and increased performance,
    reliability, and security to end-users. See Note 11,

    Delaware in 1998. Our corporate headquarters are located in
    Sunnyvale, California. Our website address is www.juniper.net.

Our
    Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of
    high-performance network infrastructure by transforming the
    experience and economics of networking. Key elements of our
    strategy are described below.

Maintain
    and Extend Technology Leadership

Our Junos OS, application-specific integrated circuit
    (“ASIC”) technology, and network-optimized product
    architecture have been key elements to establishing and
    maintaining our technology leadership. We believe that these
    elements can be leveraged into future products that we are
    currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our
    technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise
    markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in
    research and development (“R&D”), supplemented by
    external partnerships, including strategic alliances, that would
    allow us to deliver a broad range of products and services to
    customers in target markets.



Leverage
    Position as Supplier of High-Performance Network
    Infrastructure

From inception, we have focused on designing, developing, and
    building high-performance network infrastructure for demanding
    service provider and enterprise networking environments and have
    integrated purpose-built technology into a network-optimized
    architecture that specifically meets our customers’ needs.
    We believe that many of these customers will deploy networking
    equipment from only a few vendors. We believe that the
    performance, reliability, and security of our products provide
    us with a competitive advantage, which is critical in gaining
    selection as one of these vendors.

Be
    Strategic to Our Customers

In developing our Infrastructure and SLT solutions, we work very
    closely with customers to design and build

best-in-class

products and solutions specifically designed to meet their
    complex needs. Over time, we have expanded our understanding of
    the escalating demands and risks facing our customers. That
    increased understanding has enabled us subsequently to design
    additional capabilities into our products. We believe our close
    relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers
    have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments
    to date. We plan to continue to work

hand-in-hand

with our customers to implement product enhancements as well as
    to design future products that meet the evolving needs of the
    marketplace, while enabling customers to reduce costs.

Enable
    New

IP-Based

Services

Our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and
    secure networks cost-effectively and deploy new differentiated
    services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than
    legacy network products. We believe that the secure delivery of

IP-based

services and applications, web hosting, outsourced Internet and
    intranet services, outsourced enterprise applications, and
    voice-over IP, will continue to grow, and are cost-effectively
    enabled by our high-performance network infrastructure offerings.

Establish
    and Develop Industry Partnerships

Our customers have diverse requirements. While our products meet
    certain requirements of our customers, our products are not
    intended to satisfy certain other requirements. Therefore, we
    believe that it is important that we attract and build
    relationships with other industry leaders in a diverse set of
    technologies and services that extend the value of the network
    for our customers. These partnerships ensure that we have access
    to those technologies and services, whether through technology
    integration, joint development, resale, or other collaboration,
    in order to better support a broader set of our customers’
    requirements. In addition, we believe in an open network
    infrastructure that invites partner innovation and provides
    customers with greater choice and control in meeting their
    evolving business requirements, while enabling them to reduce
    costs.

Markets
    and Customers

We sell our high-performance network products and service
    offerings through direct sales and through distributors,
    value-added resellers, and original equipment manufacturer
    (“OEM”) partners to end-users in the following markets:

Service
    Providers

Service providers include wireline, wireless, and cable
    operators, as well as major Internet content and application
    providers. Supporting most major service provider networks in
    the world, our high-performance network infrastructure offerings
    are designed and built for the performance, reliability, and
    security that service providers demand. Our networking
    infrastructure offerings benefit these customers by:

•

Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple
    services over the same network using our high density, highly
    reliable platforms;

•

Promoting generation of additional revenues by enabling new
    services to be offered to new market segments based on our
    product capabilities;



•

Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by
    enabling consumers to self-select automatically provisioned
    service packages that provide the quality, speed, and pricing
    they desire; and

•

Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on
    investment as their networks can scale to multi-terabit rates
    based on the capabilities of our platforms.

While many of these service providers have historically been
    categorized separately as wireline, wireless, or cable
    operators, in recent years, we have seen a move towards
    convergence of these different types of service providers
    through acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships. We believe
    these strategic developments are made technically possible as
    operators invest in the build out of next generation networks
    capable of supporting voice, video, and data traffic on to the
    same

IP-based

network. This convergence relies on

IP-based

traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multi-service
    networks and offer service providers significant new revenue
    opportunities.

We believe that there are several other trends affecting service
    providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products
    and solutions. These trends include significant growth in IP
    traffic on service provider networks because of

peer-to-peer

interaction, broadband usage, video, and an increasing reliance
    on the network as a mission critical business tool in the
    strategies of our IP customers and of their enterprise customers.

The IP infrastructure market for service providers includes:
    products and technology at the network core; the network edge to
    enable access; the aggregation layer; security to protect from
    the inside out and the outside in; the application awareness and
    intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user
    needs; and the management, service awareness, and control of the
    entire infrastructure.

Enterprise

Our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are
    designed to meet the performance, reliability, and security
    requirements of the world’s most demanding businesses. For
    this reason, enterprises and public sector organizations such as
    governments and research and education institutions that view
    their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy
    our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced
    network capabilities needed for their leading-edge applications
    while:

•

Assisting in the consolidation and delivery of existing services
    and applications;

•

Accelerating the deployment of new services and applications;

•

Offering integrated security to assist in the protection and
    recovery of services and applications; and

•

Offering operational improvements that enable cost reductions,
    including lower administrative, training, customer care, and
    labor costs.

As with the service provider market, innovation continues to be
    a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market.
    We believe that innovative enterprises view the network as
    critical to their success and therefore must build advanced
    network infrastructures that provide fast, reliable, and secure
    access to services and applications over a single

IP-based

network. These high-performance enterprises require networks
    that are global, distributed, and always available. Network
    equipment vendors need to demonstrate performance, reliability,
    and security to these customers in specific segments with

best-in-class

open solutions for maximum flexibility. We offer enterprise
    solutions and services for data centers, branch and campus
    applications, distributed and extended enterprises, and Wide
    Area Network (“WAN”) gateways.

As customers increasingly view the network as critical to their
    success, we believe that customers will increasingly demand
    fast, reliable, and secure access to services and applications
    over a single

IP-based

network. This is partly illustrated by the success of our SRX
    Services Gateways that consolidate switching, routing, and
    security services in a single device, Integrated Security
    Gateway (“ISG”) products that combine firewall/virtual
    private network (“VPN”) and intrusion detection and
    prevention (“IDP”) solutions in a single platform and
    Secure Services Gateway (“SSG”) platforms that provide
    a mix of high-performance security with Local Area Network
    (“LAN”)/WAN connectivity for regional and branch
    office deployments. We will continue to invest to develop these
    and other converged technologies and solutions.



Customers
    with Ten Percent of Net Revenues or Greater

AT&T, Inc., accounted for greater than 10% of our total net
    revenues in 2009. No single customer accounted for more than 10%
    of our total net revenues in 2008. Nokia-Siemens Networks B.V.
    (“NSN”) accounted for greater than 10% of our total
    net revenues in 2007.

Our
    Products and Technology

Early in our history, we developed, marketed, and sold the first
    commercially available purpose-built IP backbone router
    optimized for the specific high-performance requirements of
    service providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to
    increase, the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the
    network was created. Our Infrastructure products are designed to
    address the needs at the core and the edge of the network as
    well as for wireless access by combining high-performance packet
    forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a
    network-optimized solution. In addition, as enterprises continue
    to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive
    internal networks, we believe the need for products with
    high-performance routing and switching technology is expanding
    to a broader set of customers, and we believe our expertise in
    this technology uniquely positions us to address this growing
    market opportunity.

Additionally, our SLT segment offers a broad family of network
    security solutions that deliver high-performance, cost-effective
    security for enterprises, service providers, and government
    entities, including integrated firewall and VPN solutions,
    secure sockets layer (“SSL”) VPN appliances, and IDP
    appliances. We also offer complementary products and
    technologies to enable our customers to provide additional

IP-based

services and enhance the performance and security of their
    existing networks and applications.

The following is an overview of our major Infrastructure and SLT
    product families:

Junos
    Platform

In addition to our major product families, our extended software
    portfolio, known as Junos Platform, is a key technology element
    in our strategy to be the leader in high-performance networking.
    The Junos Platform includes the Junos Space network application
    platform and Junos Pulse integrated, multi-service network
    client, which have been built with the same core design
    principles, integration approach, and development discipline.
    The Junos Platform enables our customers to expand network
    software into the application space, deploy software clients to
    control delivery, and accelerate the pace of innovation with an
    ecosystem of developers.

At the heart of the Junos Platform is Junos OS. We believe Junos
    OS is fundamentally superior to other network operating systems
    in not only its design, but also in its development. The
    advantages of Junos OS include:

•

One modular operating system with single source base of code and
    a single, consistent implementation for each control plane
    feature;

•

One software release train extended through a highly disciplined
    and firmly scheduled development process; and

•

One common modular software architecture that scales across all
    Junos-based platforms.

Junos OS is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve
    the availability, performance, and security of business
    applications running across the network. Junos OS helps to
    automate network operations by providing a single consistent
    implementation of features across the network in a single
    release train that seeks to minimize the complexity, cost, and
    risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades.
    This operational efficiency allows network administrators more
    time to innovate and deliver new revenue-generating
    applications, helping to advance the economics of
    high-performance networking.



The security and stability of Junos OS, combined with its
    modular architecture and single source code base, provides a
    foundation for delivering performance, reliability, security,
    and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple
    operating code base environments. With an increasing number of
    our platforms able to leverage Junos OS, including routing,
    switching, and security products, we believe Junos OS provides
    us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment
    vendors.

Major
    Product Development Projects

In 2009, we announced two significant product development
    efforts: Project Stratus and Project Falcon. Project Stratus is
    our initiative to develop a single data center fabric designed
    to significantly advance scale, performance and simplicity,
    while lowering energy consumption and reducing overall operating
    costs compared to currently existing data center solutions.
    Project Falcon is an effort to develop mobility solutions for
    service provider customers based on our MX 3D
    Series Universal Edge Routers and the Junos software
    platform.

Customer
    Service and Support

In addition to our Infrastructure and SLT products, we offer the
    following services: 24x7x365 technical assistance, hardware
    repair and replacement parts, unspecified software updates on a

when-and-if-available

basis, professional services, and educational services. We
    deliver these services directly to end-users and utilize a
    multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our
    partners and third-party organizations, as appropriate.

We also train our channel partners in the delivery of education
    and support services to ensure locally delivered training.

As of December 31, 2009, we employed 891 people in our
    worldwide customer service and support organization. We believe
    that a broad range of support services is essential to the
    successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our
    products, and we have hired support engineers with proven
    network experience to provide those services.

Manufacturing
    and Operations

As of December 31, 2009, we employed 244 people in
    manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships
    with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and
    monitor and manage product testing and quality.

We have manufacturing relationships primarily with Celestica,
    Flextronics, and Plexus, under which we have subcontracted the
    majority of our manufacturing activity. Our manufacturing
    activity is primarily conducted in China, Malaysia, Mexico, and
    the United States.

This subcontracting activity in all locations extends from
    prototypes to full production and includes activities such as
    material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to
    our customers, and repairs. Together with our contract
    manufacturers, we design, specify, and monitor the tests that
    are required to meet internal and external quality standards.
    These arrangements provide us with the following benefits:

•

We can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey
    manufacturing and drop-shipment capabilities;

•

We gain economies of scale because, by purchasing large
    quantities of common components, our contract manufacturers
    obtain more favorable pricing than if we were buying components
    alone;

•

We operate without dedicating significant space to manufacturing
    operations; and

•

We can reduce our costs by reducing fixed overhead expenses.

Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on our
    rolling product demand forecasts. Each of the contract
    manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the
    products in our forecast and tests the products according to our
    specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors,
    value-added resellers, or end-users. Generally, we do not own
    the components, and title to the products transfers from the
    contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers
    upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the
    components remain unused or the products remain unsold for
    specified period, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete
    material



charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased
    to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers,
    those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the
    contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The
    contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a
    long-term basis.

Our ASICs are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources,
    such as International Business Machines (“IBM”)
    Corporation each of which is responsible for all aspects of the
    production of the ASICs using our proprietary designs.

We have five core values: trust, respect, humility, integrity,
    and excellence. These values are integral to how we manage our
    company and interact with our employees, customers, partners,
    and suppliers. By working collaboratively with our suppliers, we
    also have the opportunity to promote socially responsible
    business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide
    supply chain. To this end, we have adopted, and promote the
    adoption by others, of the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct
    (“EICC”). The EICC outlines standards to ensure that
    working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are
    safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and
    that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.

Research
    and Development

As of December 31, 2009, we employed 3,308 people in
    our worldwide R&D organization. We have assembled a team of
    skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of
    high-end computing, network system design, ASIC design,
    security, routing protocols, and embedded operating systems.
    These individuals have worked in leading computer data
    networking and telecommunication companies.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are
    essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology,
    developing additional applications, incorporating that
    technology, and maintaining the competitiveness of our product
    and service offerings. In our Infrastructure and SLT products,
    we are leveraging our software and ASIC technology, developing
    additional network interfaces targeted to our customers’
    applications, and continuing to develop technology to support
    the anticipated growth in IP network requirements. We continue
    to expand the functionality of our products to improve
    performance reliability and scalability, and to provide an
    enhanced user interface.

Our R&D process is driven by the availability of new
    technology, market demand, and customer feedback. We have
    invested significant time and resources in creating a structured
    process for all product development projects. Following an
    assessment of market demand, our R&D team develops a full
    set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on
    inputs from the product management and sales organizations. This
    process is designed to provide a framework for defining and
    addressing the steps, tasks, and activities required to bring
    product concepts and development projects to market.

Sales and
    Marketing

As of December 31, 2009, we employed 2,101 people in
    our worldwide sales and marketing organization. These sales and
    marketing employees operate in different locations around the
    world in support of our customers.

Our sales organization is generally split between service
    provider and enterprise customers, with each separate team
    ensuring focus on key customers in these respective markets.
    From a geographic perspective, the organization is grouped into
    three geographic regions, which are: (i) the Americas
    (including United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and South
    America), (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa
    (“EMEA”) and (iii) Asia Pacific
    (“APAC”). Within each region, there are regional and
    country teams, as well as major account teams, to ensure we
    operate close to our customers.  There is a structure of sales
    professionals, system engineers, and marketing and channel teams
    each focused on the respective service provider and enterprise
    markets.



See Note 11,

Segment Information

, in Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions
    and by significant customers, which is incorporated herein by
    reference. Our operations subject us to certain risks and
    uncertainties associated with international operations. See
    Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” for more
    information.

Our sales teams operate in their respective regions and
    generally either engage customers directly or manage customer
    opportunities through our distribution and reseller
    relationships or channels as described below.

In the United States and Canada, we sell to several service
    providers directly and sell to other service providers and
    enterprise customers primarily through distributors and
    resellers. Almost all of our sales outside the United States and
    Canada are made through our channel partners.

Direct
    Sales Structure

Where we have a direct relationship with our customers, the
    terms and conditions are governed either by customer purchase
    orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by purchase
    contracts. In instances where we have direct contracts with our
    customers, those contracts set forth only general terms of sale
    and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of
    our products. For this type of customer, our sales team engages
    directly with the customer. We directly receive and process
    customer purchase orders.

Channel
    Sales Structure

A critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our
    channel partners through which we do the majority of our
    business. We employ various channel partners, including but not
    limited to:

•

A global network of strategic distribution relationships, as
    well as region or country-specific distributors who in turn sell
    to local value-added resellers who sell to end-user customers.
    The distribution channel partners mainly sell our SLT products
    plus certain Infrastructure products that are often purchased by
    our enterprise customers. These distributors tend to be focused
    on particular regions or particular countries within regions.
    For example, we have substantial distribution relationships with
    Ingram Micro in the Americas and with NEC in Japan. Our
    agreements with these distributors are generally non-exclusive,
    limited by region, and provide product discounts and other
    ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require our
    distributors to purchase specified quantities of our products.

•

Direct value-added resellers including our strategic resellers
    referenced below, which resell our products to end-users around
    the world. These direct value-added resellers buy the products
    and services directly from us and have expertise in deploying
    complex networking solutions in their respective markets. Our
    agreements with these direct value-added resellers are generally
    non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product discounts
    and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not
    require our direct value-added resellers to purchase specified
    quantities of our products.

•

Strategic worldwide reseller relationships with NSN, Ericsson
    Telecom A.B. (“Ericsson”), and IBM. These companies
    each offer services and products that complement, but in some
    cases compete with, our own product offerings and act as a
    fulfillment partner for our products. Our arrangements with
    these partners allow them to resell our products on a worldwide,
    non-exclusive basis, provide for product discounts, and specify
    other general terms of sale. These agreements do not require
    these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products.

•

OEM relationships with Dell Corporation and IBM. Our OEM
    arrangements with these partners allow them to rebrand and
    resell certain of our product lines on a worldwide,
    non-exclusive basis, provide for product discounts, and specify
    other general terms of sale. These agreements do not require
    these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products.

Within each region, we employ sales professionals to assist with
    the management of our various sales channels. In addition, we
    have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly
    with the channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a
    direct relationship with our more strategic end-user customers
    while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of
    product through our channel partners.



Backlog

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under
    framework agreements with our customers. At any given time, we
    have backlog orders for products that have not been shipped.
    Because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery
    schedules without significant penalty, we believe that our
    backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of
    future operating results. As of December 31, 2009, and
    2008, our total backlog orders was approximately
    $270 million and $250 million, respectively. Our
    backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to
    be shipped to customers generally within six months. Our backlog
    excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product
    revenue on sales made through distributors upon sell-through to
    end-users.

Seasonality

Many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal
    fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the
    first and third quarters. In addition, our SLT segment has
    experienced seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth
    quarter. This historical pattern should not be considered a
    reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial
    performance.

Competition

Infrastructure
    Business

In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems has
    historically been the dominant player in the market. However,
    other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade Communications
    Systems, Inc., Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Inc., Hewlett Packard
    Company, and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. are providing
    competitive products in the marketplace.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco,
    Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei have significantly broader product
    lines than we do and may bundle their products with other
    networking products in a manner that may discourage customers
    from purchasing our products. In addition, consolidation among
    competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by
    competitors, can increase the competitive pressure faced by us.
    For example, in 2007, Ericsson acquired Redback Networks, and in
    2009, Brocade acquired Foundry Networks. In addition, many of
    our current and potential competitors have greater name
    recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be
    leveraged. Increased competition could result in price
    reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and
    loss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our
    operating results.

SLT
    Business

In the market for SLT products, Cisco generally is our primary
    competitor with its broad range of products. In addition, there
    are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines
    within SLT, including Checkpoint Software Technologies,
    Fortinet, Inc., F5 Networks, Inc., and Riverbed Technology, Inc.
    These additional competitors tend to be focused on single
    product line solutions and, therefore, are generally specialized
    as competitors to our products. In addition, a number of public
    and private companies have announced plans for new products to
    address the same needs that our products address. We believe
    that our ability to compete with Cisco and others depends upon
    our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in
    meeting the needs of our current and potential customers.

For both product groups, we expect that, over time, large
    companies with significant resources, technical expertise,
    market experience, customer relationships, and broad product
    lines, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei, will introduce
    new products, which are designed to compete more effectively in
    the market. There are also several other companies that claim to
    have products with greater capabilities than our products.
    Consolidation in this industry has begun, with one or more of
    these companies being acquired by large, established suppliers
    of network infrastructure products, and we believe it is likely
    to continue.

As a result, we expect to face increased competition in the
    future from larger companies with significantly more resources
    than we have. Although we believe that our technology and the
    purpose-built features of our



products make them unique and will enable us to compete
    effectively with these companies, we cannot guarantee that we
    will be successful.

Environment

We are subject to regulations that have been adopted with
    respect to environmental matters, such as the Waste Electrical
    and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”), Restriction of the
    Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
    Equipment (“RoHS”), and Registration, Evaluation,
    Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“Reach”)
    regulations adopted by the European Union. In addition, we
    participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”).
    CDP is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report
    their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors. It
    hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas
    data in the world at www.cdproject.net. We continue to invest in
    the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory
    and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis. We believe
    we have made significant strides in improving our energy
    efficiency around the world.

Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted
    for the protection of the environment has to date had no
    material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or
    competitive position.

In addition, we are committed to the environment by our effort
    in improving the energy efficiency of key elements of our
    high-performance network product offerings. For example, our
    T1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive
    products. The environment will remain a focus area across
    multiple aspects of our business.

Intellectual
    Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent
    upon our internally developed technology and expertise.

While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark
    law to protect our technology, we also believe that factors such
    as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new
    product developments, frequent product enhancements, and
    reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and
    maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no
    assurance that others will not develop technologies that are
    similar or superior to our technology.

In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into
    certain of our products. From time to time, we license
    additional technology from third parties to develop new products
    or product enhancements. There can be no assurance that
    third-party licenses will be available or continue to be
    available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability
    to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in
    our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses
    necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could
    require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or
    performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could
    harm our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

Our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary
    intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual
    property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be
    issued on the patent applications that we have filed, or that we
    will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property
    rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual
    property rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had 7,231 full-time
    employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we
    consider our relations with our employees to be good.
    Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense.
    We believe that our future success depends in part on our
    continued ability to hire, motivate, and retain qualified
    personnel. We believe that we have been successful in recruiting
    qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will
    continue to be successful in the future.

Our future performance depends in significant part upon the
    continued service of our key technical, sales, and senior
    management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment
    agreement requiring service for any



defined period of time. The loss of the services of one or more
    of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our
    future success also depends on our continuing ability to
    attract, train, and retain highly qualified technical, sales,
    and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel is
    intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain our
    key personnel in the future.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Factors
    That May Affect Future Results

Investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies
    involve significant risks. The market price of our stock has
    historically reflected a higher multiple of expected future
    earnings than many other companies. Accordingly, even small
    changes in investor expectations for our future growth and
    earnings, whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or
    operating results, changes in the mix of the products and
    services sold, acquisitions, industry changes or other factors,
    could trigger, and have triggered, significant fluctuations in
    the market price of our common stock. Investors in our
    securities should carefully consider all of the relevant
    factors, including, but not limited to, the following factors,
    that could affect our stock price.

Our
    quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to
    substantial fluctuations, and, as a result, we may fail to meet
    the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which
    could adversely affect the trading price of our common
    stock.

Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from

quarter-to-quarter

due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our
    control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate.

The factors that may affect the unpredictability of our
    quarterly results include, but are not limited to: limited
    visibility into customer spending plans, changes in the mix of
    products sold, changes in geographies in which our products are
    sold, changing market conditions, including current and
    potential customer consolidation, competition, customer
    concentration, long sales and implementation cycles, regional
    economic and political conditions, and seasonality. For example,
    many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal
    fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the
    first and third quarters.

As a result, we believe that

quarter-to-quarter

comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good
    indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely
    that in some future quarters, our operating results may be below
    the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which
    case the price of our common stock may decline. Such a decline
    could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met
    our publicly stated revenues

and/or

earnings guidance.

Fluctuating
    economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a
    particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in
    costs of production may harm our operating
    results.

Our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions
    and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.
    Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and
    constrained spending on network



expansion have recently resulted, and may in the future result,
    in decreased revenues and earnings and could negatively impact
    our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer
    relationships. In addition, recent turmoil in the global
    financial markets and associated economic weakness, or
    recession, particularly in the United States and Europe, as well
    as turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the
    world, may continue to put pressure on global economic
    conditions, which could lead to continued reduced demand for our
    products

and/or

higher costs of production. The current economic weakness may
    also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our
    customers, an increase in customer bad debt, restructuring
    initiatives and associated expenses, and impairment of
    investments. Furthermore, the recent disruption in worldwide
    credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers
    to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures, which
    could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of
    our products or services. In addition, our operating expenses
    are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high
    percentage of our expenses is, and will continue to be, fixed in
    the short-term. Uncertainty about future economic conditions
    makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make
    decisions about future investments. Future or continued economic
    weakness, customer financial difficulties, increases in costs of
    production, and reductions in spending on network maintenance
    and expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for
    our products and consequently on our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

A
    limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion
    of our revenues and any decrease in revenues from these
    customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and
    operating results.

A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a
    limited number of customers and distribution partners. For
    example, AT&T, Inc., accounted for greater than 10% of our
    net revenues in fiscal year 2009. This customer concentration
    increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and
    operating results. Changes in the business requirements, vendor
    selection, or purchasing behavior of our key customers or
    potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to
    such customers. In addition, the recession’s impact on
    worldwide credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our
    customers to adequately fund their expected capital
    expenditures, which could lead to delays or cancellations of
    planned purchases of our products or services. Any of these
    factors could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

In addition, in recent years, there has been consolidation in
    the telecommunications industry (for example, the acquisitions
    of AT&T, Inc., MCI, Inc., and BellSouth Corporation) and
    consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications
    equipment and services (for example, the acquisition of Redback
    by Ericsson, the joint venture of NSN, and the acquisition of
    Foundry Networks by Brocade). Such consolidation may cause our
    customers who are involved in these transactions to suspend or
    indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have
    other unforeseen consequences that could harm our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

If we
    receive Infrastructure product orders late in a quarter, we may
    be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same
    period, which could adversely affect our quarterly
    revenues.

Generally, our Infrastructure products are not stocked by
    distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and
    configurations required by our customers, and we generally build
    such products as orders are received. If orders for these
    products are received late in any quarter, we may not be able to
    build, ship, and recognize revenue for these orders in the same
    period, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our
    expected revenues for such quarter.

We
    face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and
    adversely affect our financial results.

Competition is intense in the markets that we address. The
    infrastructure market has historically been dominated by Cisco
    with other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade, Ericsson,
    Extreme Networks, Hewlett-Packard Company, and Huawei providing
    products to a smaller segment of the market. In addition, a
    number of other small public and private companies have products
    or have announced plans for new products to address the same
    challenges and markets that our products address.

In the SLT market, we face intense competition from a broader
    group of companies such as CheckPoint, Cisco, Fortinet, F5
    Networks, and Riverbed. In addition, a number of other small
    public and private companies have



products or have announced plans for new products to address the
    same challenges and markets that our products address.

In addition, actual or speculated consolidation among
    competitors, or the acquisition of our partners

and/or

resellers by competitors, can increase the competitive pressures
    faced by us. In this regard, Ericsson acquired Redback in 2007
    and Brocade acquired Foundry Networks in 2009. A number of our
    competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a
    wider range of products and services for the overall network
    equipment market than we do. If we are unable to compete
    successfully against existing and future competitors on the
    basis of product offerings or price, we could experience a loss
    in market share and revenues

and/or

be
    required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins,
    and which could materially and adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

We
    rely on value-added resellers, distribution, and original
    equipment manufacturer partners to sell our products, and
    disruptions to, or our failure to effectively develop and manage
    our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that
    support it could adversely affect our ability to generate
    revenues from the sale of our products.

Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and
    maintaining successful relationships with a variety of
    value-added reseller and distribution partners, including our
    worldwide strategic partners such as Ericsson, IBM, and NSN. The
    majority of our revenues are derived through value-added
    resellers and distributors, most of which also sell
    competitors’ products. Our revenues depend in part on the
    performance of these partners. The loss of or reduction in sales
    to our value-added resellers or distributors could materially
    reduce our revenues. For example, in 2006, one of our largest
    resellers, Lucent, merged with Alcatel, a competitor of ours. As
    a result of becoming a competitor, their resales of our products
    declined subsequent to the merger, and we ultimately terminated
    our reseller agreement. Our competitors may in some cases be
    effective in providing incentives to current or potential
    resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent
    or reduce sales of our products. If we fail to maintain and
    develop relationships with our partners, fail to develop new
    relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new
    markets, or expand the number of distributors and resellers in
    existing markets, fail to manage, train or motivate existing
    value-added resellers and distributors effectively, or if these
    partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our
    products may decrease, and our business, financial condition,
    and results of operations would suffer.

In addition, we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a
    sell-through model using information provided by our
    distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate
    or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues
    could be adversely impacted.

Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution
    channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and
    procedures that support it, and those processes and procedures
    may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to
    manage. For example, we recently entered into an agreement to
    form a joint venture with NSN to develop and resell joint
    carrier Ethernet solutions and entered into OEM agreements with
    Dell and IBM where they will rebrand and resell our products as
    part of their product portfolios. These relationships are
    complex and require additional processes and procedures that may
    be challenging and costly to implement, maintain and manage. Our
    failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution
    channel and the processes and procedures that support it could
    adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale
    of our products.

Our
    ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner
    is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of
    the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract
    manufacturers, suppliers, or other partners, as well as
    interfaces with the systems of such third parties. If our
    systems, the systems and processes of those third parties, or
    the interfaces between them experience delays or fail, our
    business processes and our ability to build and ship products
    could be impacted, and our financial results could be
    harmed.

Some of our business processes depend upon our information
    technology systems, the systems and processes of third parties,
    and on interfaces with the systems of third parties. For
    example, our order entry system feeds information into the
    systems of our contract manufacturers, which enable them to
    build and ship our products. If



those systems fail or are interrupted, our processes may
    function at a diminished level or not at all. This could
    negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise
    operate our business, and our financial results could be harmed.
    For example, although it did not adversely affect our shipments,
    an earthquake in late December of 2006 disrupted communications
    with China, where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs.

We also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes
    of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products. If
    those systems and processes experience interruption or delay,
    our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner
    may be harmed. For example, as we have expanded our contract
    manufacturing base to China, we have experienced instances where
    our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the
    time periods expected by us. If we are not able to ship our
    products or if product shipments are delayed, our ability to
    recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be
    affected and our financial results could be harmed.

We are
    currently implementing upgrades to key internal systems and
    processes, and problems with the design or implementation of
    these systems and processes could interfere with our business
    and operations.

In 2007, we initiated a multi-year project to upgrade certain
    key internal systems and processes, including our company-wide
    human resources management system, our customer relationship
    management (“CRM”) system and enterprise resource
    planning (“ERP”) system. We have invested, and will
    continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in
    the design and implementation of these systems and processes,
    which may be disruptive to our underlying business. Any
    disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the
    new systems or processes, particularly any disruptions or delays
    that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability
    to process customer orders, ship products, provide service and
    support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill
    contractual obligations, record and transfer information in a
    timely and accurate manner, file SEC reports in a timely manner,
    or otherwise run our business. Even if we do not encounter these
    adverse effects, the design and implementation of these new
    systems and processes may be much more costly than we
    anticipated. If we are unable to successfully design and
    implement these new systems and processes as planned, or if the
    implementation of these systems and processes is more costly
    than anticipated, our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations could be negatively impacted.

Telecommunications
    companies and other large companies generally require more
    onerous terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to
    sell more products to such customers, we may be required to
    agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on
    our business or ability to recognize revenues.

Telecommunications service provider companies and other large
    companies, because of their size, generally have greater
    purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received
    more favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous
    terms and conditions for their vendors. As we seek to sell more
    products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree
    to such terms and conditions, which may include terms that
    affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have
    an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
    results of operations. Consolidation among such large customers
    can further increase their buying power and ability to require
    onerous terms.

For example, many customers in this class have purchased
    products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver
    certain functionality

and/or

had
    products that caused problems or outages in the networks of
    these customers. As a result, this class of customers may
    request additional features from us and require substantial
    penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require
    substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused
    by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we
    are required to agree to them, may require us to defer revenue
    recognition from such sales, which may negatively affect our
    business, financial condition, and results of operations.

For arrangements with multiple elements, our accounting policies
    require vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of
    fair value of the undelivered to separate the components and to
    account for elements of the arrangement separately. VSOE of fair
    value is based on the price charged when the element is sold
    separately. However, customers may require terms and conditions
    that make it more difficult or impossible for us to maintain
    VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements to a similar
    group of customers, the result of which could cause us



to defer the entire arrangement fees for a similar group of
    customers (product, maintenance, professional services, etc.)
    and recognize revenue only when the last element is delivered,
    or if the only undelivered element is maintenance revenue, we
    would recognize revenue ratably over the contractual maintenance
    period, which is generally one year, but could be substantially
    longer.

We
    expect gross margin to vary over time, and our recent level of
    product gross margin may not be sustainable.

Our product gross margins will vary from

quarter-to-quarter,

and the recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and
    may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors,
    including product mix shifts, increased price competition in one
    or more of the markets in which we compete, increases in
    material or labor costs, excess product component or
    obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers, increased
    costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred
    due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not
    accurately anticipate product demand, warranty related issues,
    or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets
    with different pricing and cost structures.

If we
    do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities,
    and develop products and product enhancements that meet those
    needs and opportunities, or if those products are not made
    available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance,
    we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to
    generate revenues will suffer.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future
    market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new
    products or product enhancements to meet such needs or
    opportunities in a timely manner or at all. If we fail to
    anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce
    new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a
    timely manner, such failure could substantially decrease or
    delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future
    products, which would significantly harm our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations. Even if we are able to
    anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce new products and
    enhancements, there can be no assurance that new products or
    enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance.

For example, in 2008, we announced new products designed to
    address the Ethernet switching market, a market in which we had
    not had a historical presence. In addition, in 2009 we announced
    plans to develop and introduce new data center products with our
    Project Stratus and mobility solutions with our Project Falcon.
    If these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at
    a sufficient rate of growth, our ability to meet future
    financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected. In
    addition, if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the
    market in a timely manner, it could adversely affect the market
    acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position
    and business and financial results.

Changes
    in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from
    examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely
    affect our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or
    adversely affected by: earnings being lower than anticipated in
    countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than
    anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory
    rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets
    and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax
    credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments related to certain
    acquisitions including the license of acquired intangibles under
    our intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement; by tax
    effects of stock-based compensation; by costs related to
    intercompany restructurings; or by changes in tax laws,
    regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.
    In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our
    income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess
    the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
    examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for
    income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from
    these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

For example, in 2009, we received a proposed adjustment from the
    IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and
    possible penalties, for the 2004 tax year based on a transfer
    pricing transaction related to the license of acquired
    intangibles under an intercompany R&D cost sharing
    arrangement. As a result of the proposed



adjustment, the incremental tax liability would be approximately
    $807.0 million excluding interest and penalties. We
    strongly believe the IRS’ position with regard to this
    matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing
    Treasury regulations, and that our previously reported income
    tax provision for the year in question is appropriate. However,
    there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in
    our favor. Regardless of whether this matter is resolved in our
    favor, the final resolution of this matter could be expensive
    and time-consuming to defend

and/or

settle. While we believe we have provided adequately for this
    matter, there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of
    the matter could have a material effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition.

Governmental
    regulations affecting the import or export of products could
    negatively affect our revenues.

The United States and various foreign governments have imposed
    controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the
    import or export of some technologies, especially encryption
    technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental
    agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption
    technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental
    recovery of private encryption keys. Governmental regulation of
    encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or
    our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our
    products, could harm our international and domestic sales and
    adversely affect our revenues. In addition, failure to comply
    with such regulations could result in penalties, costs, and
    restrictions on export privileges.

If we
    fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we
    could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays,
    which would harm our business.

We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers. If we
    overestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may
    assess charges, or we may have liabilities for excess inventory,
    each of which could negatively affect our gross margins.
    Conversely, because lead times for required materials and
    components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the
    specific supplier, contract terms, and the demand for each
    component at a given time, if we underestimate our requirements,
    our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time, materials,

and/or

components required to produce our products, which could
    increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our
    products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss
    of revenues.

We are
    dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for
    several key components, which makes us susceptible to shortages
    or price fluctuations in our supply chain, and we may face
    increased challenges in supply chain management in the
    future.

During periods of high demand for electronic products, component
    shortages are possible, and the predictability of the
    availability of such components may be limited. Any future
    growth in our business and the economy is likely to create
    greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project
    overall component demand and to establish optimal component
    levels. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these
    components may increase, or the components may not be available
    at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at
    reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products
    in a timely manner, and our revenues and gross margins could
    suffer until other sources can be developed. For example, from
    time to time, including the first quarter of 2008, we have
    experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of
    product shipments. We currently purchase numerous key
    components, including ASICs, from single or limited sources. The
    development of alternate sources for those components is
    time-consuming, difficult, and costly. In addition, the lead
    times associated with certain components are lengthy and
    preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. In
    the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from
    these suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or
    second sources in a timely manner. If, as a result, we are
    unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet
    our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to
    deliver product to our customers, which would seriously affect
    present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, the development, licensing, or acquisition of new
    products in the future may increase the complexity of supply
    chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of
    key components and products would adversely affect our business.



We are
    dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have
    long-term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships,
    expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that
    could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer
    relationships.

We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of which
    is a third-party manufacturer for numerous companies) to
    manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with our
    contract manufacturers, those contracts do not require them to
    manufacture our products on a long-term basis in any specific
    quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is
    time-consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional
    contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we should
    fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer
    relationships or if one or more of them should experience
    delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in our
    manufacturing operations, or if we had to change or add
    additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing
    sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be
    delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or
    contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our
    supply chain management. Moreover, an increasing portion of our
    manufacturing is performed in China and other countries and is
    therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in
    other countries. Each of these factors could adversely affect
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are
    a party to lawsuits, which are costly to defend and, if
    determined adversely to us, could require us to pay damages or
    prevent us from taking certain actions, any or all of which
    could harm our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations.

We and certain of our current and former officers and current
    and former members of our Board of Directors are subject to
    various lawsuits. For example, we are a party to a number of
    patent infringement and other lawsuits. In addition, we have
    been served with lawsuits related to the alleged backdating of
    stock options and other related matters, a description of which
    can be found in Note 13,

Commitments and
    Contingencies

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

under the heading “Legal Proceedings.” There can be no
    assurance that these or any actions that have been or may be
    brought against us will be resolved in our favor or that
    tentative settlements will become final. Regardless of whether
    they are resolved in our favor, these lawsuits are, and any
    future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be,
    expensive and time-consuming to defend, settle,

and/or

resolve. Such costs of defense, as well as any losses resulting
    from these claims or settlement of these claims, could
    significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Litigation
    or claims regarding intellectual property rights may be
    time-consuming, expensive and require a significant amount of
    resources to prosecute, defend, or make our products
    non-infringing.

Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims
    or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark,
    and other intellectual property rights to technologies and
    related standards that are relevant to our products. The
    asserted claims

and/or

initiated litigation may include claims against us or our
    manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of
    their proprietary rights with respect to our products.
    Regardless of the merit of these claims, they have been and can
    be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, and may require
    us to develop non-infringing technologies or enter into license
    agreements. Furthermore, because of the potential for high
    awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily
    predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled
    for significant amounts of money. If any infringement or other
    intellectual property claim made against us by any third party
    is successful, if we are required to settle litigation for
    significant amounts of money, or if we fail to develop
    non-infringing technology or license required proprietary rights
    on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Our
    success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage
    our resources and restructure our business through rapidly
    fluctuating economic and market conditions.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a
    rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning,
    forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively
    scale our business and adjust our business in response to
    fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. In periods of
    market expansion, we have increased



investment in our business by, for example, increasing headcount
    and increasing our investment in R&D and other parts of our
    business. Conversely, during 2009, in response to downward
    trending industry and market conditions, we restructured our
    business, rebalanced our workforce, and reduced our real estate
    portfolio. Many of our expenses, such as real estate expenses,
    cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted because of fluctuations in
    our business or numbers of employees. Moreover, rapid changes in
    the size of our workforce could adversely affect the ability to
    develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair
    our ability to realize our current or future business objectives.

The
    long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well
    as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place
    large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues and
    operating results to vary significantly from

quarter-to-quarter.

A customer’s decision to purchase certain of our products
    involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy
    evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the
    sales cycle may be lengthy. In particular, customers making
    critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of
    large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement
    processes that may delay or impact expected future orders.
    Throughout the sales cycle, we may spend considerable time
    educating and providing information to prospective customers
    regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even after
    making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our
    products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary
    widely and depends on the skill set of the customer, the size of
    the network deployment, the complexity of the customer’s
    network environment, and the degree of hardware and operating
    system configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers
    with large networks usually expand their networks in large
    increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive
    purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular
    basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation that
    customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with
    short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to
    vary significantly and unexpectedly from

quarter-to-quarter.

We
    sell our products to customers that use those products to build
    networks and IP infrastructure, and if the demand for network
    and IP systems does not continue to grow, then our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations could be
    adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on
    the growth of secure IP infrastructure and on the deployment of
    our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of
    IP services. As a result of changes in the economy and capital
    spending or the building of network capacity in excess of
    demand, all of which have in the past particularly affected
    telecommunications service providers, spending on IP
    infrastructure can vary, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations. In addition, a number of our existing customers are
    evaluating the build out of their next generation networks.
    During the decision-making period when the customers are
    determining the design of those networks and the selection of
    the equipment they will use in those networks, such customers
    may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure IP
    infrastructure. Such pauses in purchases can make it more
    difficult to predict revenues from such customers, can cause
    fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and,
    even where our products are ultimately selected, can have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    and results of operations.

A
    breach of network security could harm public perception of our
    security products, which could cause us to lose
    revenues.

If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in
    our network or in the network of a customer of our security
    products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to
    our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
    products could be harmed. This could cause us to lose current
    and potential end-customers or cause us to lose current and
    potential value-added resellers and distributors. Because the
    techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage
    networks change frequently and generally are not recognized
    until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate
    these techniques.



We are
    subject to risks arising from our international
    operations.

We derive a majority of our revenues from our international
    operations, and we plan to continue expanding our business in
    international markets in the future. We conduct significant
    sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly
    through our distributors and value-added resellers in countries
    throughout the world and depend on the operations of our
    contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located inside and
    outside of the United States. In addition, our R&D and our
    general and administrative (“G&A”) operations are
    conducted in the United States as well as other countries.

As a result of our international operations, we are affected by
    economic, regulatory, social, and political conditions in
    foreign countries, including changes in general IT spending, the
    imposition of government controls, changes or limitations in
    trade protection laws, other regulatory requirements, which may
    affect our ability to import or export our products from various
    countries, service provider and government spending patterns
    affected by political considerations, unfavorable changes in tax
    treaties or laws, natural disasters, epidemic disease, labor
    unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions, misappropriation of
    intellectual property, military actions, acts of terrorism,
    political or social unrest, and difficulties in staffing and
    managing international operations. In particular, in some
    countries, we may experience reduced intellectual property
    protection. Any or all of these factors could have a material
    adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results
    of operations.

Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ
    significantly from those in the United States. In many foreign
    countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it
    is common for others to engage in business practices that are
    prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United
    States regulations applicable to us. Although we implement
    policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these
    laws and policies, there can be no assurance that none of our
    employees, contractors, and agents will take actions in
    violation of them. Violations of laws or key control policies by
    our employees, contractors, or agents could result in financial
    reporting problems, fines, penalties, or prohibition on the
    importation or exportation of our products and could have a
    material adverse effect on our business.

We are
    exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could
    negatively affect our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the
    United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in

non-U.S. currency

exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business
    practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

The majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in
    U.S. Dollars. We also have some transactions that are
    denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound,
    the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen related to our sales
    and service operations outside of the United States. An increase
    in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the real
    cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside
    the United States in which we sell in U.S. Dollars, and a
    weakened U.S. Dollar could increase the cost of local
    operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the
    extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated
    with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional
    currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign
    currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are
    intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on
    certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. However,
    no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances,
    including long-term declines in the value of the
    U.S. Dollar. If our attempts to hedge against these risks
    are not successful, or if long-term declines in the value of the
    U.S. Dollar persist, our financial condition and results of
    operations could be adversely impacted.

If we
    fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control
    and reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and
    grow our business will be negatively affected.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our
    business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an
    effective planning and management process. We will need to
    continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our
    reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business
    effectively in the



future. If we fail to continue to implement improved systems and
    processes, our ability to manage our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected.

Our
    ability to develop, market, and sell products could be harmed if
    we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
    retain the services of executive, engineering, sales and
    marketing, and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified
    individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized
    technical areas, or sales people specializing in the service
    provider and enterprise markets, is limited and competition for
    such individuals is intense. None of our officers or key
    employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific
    term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the
    inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays
    in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers and sales
    people, and the complexity and time involved in replacing or
    training new employees, could delay the development and
    introduction of new products, and negatively impact our ability
    to market, sell, or support our products.

In addition, we rely upon equity compensation to help recruit,
    retain and motivate our employees. At our 2010 annual meeting of
    stockholders, we plan to ask our stockholders to authorize
    additional shares for grant under our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan
    (the “2006 Plan”), which is the only plan under which
    we currently grant stock options, restricted stock units and
    performance shares to our employees. If more shares, or not
    enough shares, are not authorized by our stockholders for grant
    under the 2006 Plan, we will be significantly limited in our
    ability to grant equity awards to recruit new employees or to
    compensate existing employees, which would put us at a
    significant disadvantage to other companies that compete for
    workers in high technology industries such as ours. Accordingly,
    our ability to hire, retain, and motivate current and
    prospective employees would be harmed, the result of which could
    negatively impact our business operations.

Our
    products are highly technical and if they contain undetected
    errors, our business could be adversely affected, and we may
    need to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any
    alleged or actual failure of our products and
    services.

Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to
    the operation of many networks, and, in the case of our security
    products, provide and monitor network security and may protect
    valuable information. Our products have contained and may
    contain one or more undetected errors, defects, or security
    vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be
    discovered after a product has been installed and used by
    end-customers. Any errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities
    discovered in our products after commercial release could result
    in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of
    customers, loss of future business, and increased service and
    warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, in
    the event an error, defect, or vulnerability is attributable to
    a component supplied by a third-party vendor, we may not be able
    to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that
    we may incur. In addition, we could face claims for product
    liability, tort, or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit,
    regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert
    management’s attention. In addition, if our business
    liability insurance coverage is inadequate, or future coverage
    is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial
    condition and results of operations could be harmed.

If our
    products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks,
    installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our
    business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’
    existing networks, each of which have different specifications
    and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other
    vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple
    generations of products that have been added over time as these
    networks have grown and evolved. Our products will be required
    to interoperate with many or all of the products within these
    networks as well as future products in order to meet our
    customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing
    software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’
    networks, we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix
    or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate
    and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could
    be costly and negatively affect our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our
    products do not interoperate with those of our customers’
    networks, demand for our products could be



adversely affected or orders for our products could be
    cancelled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our
    reputation, and seriously harm our business and prospects.

Integration
    of future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our
    financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership
    of our stockholders.

We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to
    enhance our business. In 2005, we completed the acquisitions of
    five privately-held companies. Acquisitions involve numerous
    risks, including problems combining the purchased operations,
    technologies or products, unanticipated costs, diversion of
    management’s attention from our core businesses, adverse
    effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
    customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we
    have no or limited prior experience, and potential loss of key
    employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    integrate successfully any businesses, products, technologies,
    or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of
    businesses that we may acquire is likely to be, a complex,
    time-consuming, and expensive process. Acquisitions may also
    require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of
    our current stockholders, assume liabilities, record goodwill
    and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to
    impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic
    impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to
    certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate
    write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of
    which could harm our financial condition and results of
    operations.

In addition, if we fail in any acquisition integration efforts
    and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization
    utilizing common information and communication systems,
    operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources
    practices, our business, financial condition, and results of
    operations may be adversely affected.

Our
    products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party
    technology, and if licenses of third-party technology do not
    continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our
    revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could
    be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our
    products. From time to time, we may be required to license
    additional technology from third-parties to develop new products
    or product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be
    available or continue to be available to us on commercially
    reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any
    third-party licenses required in our products or our inability
    to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products
    and product enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute
    technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a
    greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

Matters
    related to the investigation into our historical stock option
    granting practices and the restatement of our financial
    statements have resulted in litigation and regulatory
    proceedings, and may result in additional litigation or other
    possible government actions.

Our historical stock option granting practices and the
    restatement of our consolidated financial statements have
    exposed us to risks such as litigation, regulatory proceedings,
    and government enforcement actions. For more information
    regarding our current litigation and related inquiries, please
    see Note 13,

Commitments and Contingencies

, in Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

under the heading “Legal Proceedings” as well as the
    other risk factors related to litigation set forth in this
    section. We have provided the results of our internal review and
    independent investigation to the SEC and the United States
    Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California,
    and in that regard, we have responded to formal and informal
    requests for documents and additional information. In August
    2007, we announced that we entered into a settlement agreement
    with the SEC in connection with our historical stock option
    granting practices in which we consented to a permanent
    injunction against any future violations of the antifraud,
    reporting,

books-and-records

and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws.
    This settlement concluded the SEC’s formal investigation of
    the Company with respect to this matter. In addition, while we
    believe that we have made appropriate judgments in determining
    the correct measurement dates for our stock option grants, the
    SEC may disagree with the manner in which we accounted for and
    reported, or did not report, the corresponding financial impact.
    We are also subject to



civil litigation related to the stock option matters. In
    February 2009, we entered into an agreement in principle to
    settle the class action litigations claims related to our
    historical stock option granting practices. Under the proposed
    settlement, which is subject to the approval of the board of
    trustees of the lead plaintiffs and the court, the claims
    against us and our officers and directors will be dismissed with
    prejudice and released in exchange for a $169 million cash
    payment by us. No assurance can be given regarding the outcomes
    from litigation or other possible government actions. The
    resolution of these matters will be time-consuming, expensive,
    and may distract management from the conduct of our business and
    the related costs of defense, as well as any losses resulting
    from these claims or final settlement of these claims, could
    significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Our
    financial condition and results of operations could suffer if
    there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other
    intangible assets with indefinite lives.

We are required to test annually and review on an interim basis,
    our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives,
    including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any
    future acquisitions, to determine if impairment has occurred. If
    such assets are deemed impaired, an impairment loss equal to the
    amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of
    the assets would be recognized. This would result in incremental
    expenses for that quarter, which would reduce any earnings or
    increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was
    determined to have occurred. For example, such impairment could
    occur if the market value of our common stock falls below
    certain levels for a sustained period, or if the portions of our
    business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at
    expected rates or decline. In the second quarter of 2006, our
    impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of
    $1,280.0 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our
    balance sheet for the SLT operating segment, primarily due to
    the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a
    period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment
    review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted
    future cash flows used in the income approach. Recently, the
    turmoil in credit markets and the broader economy has
    contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global
    stock markets that have reduced the market price of many
    technology company stocks, including ours. Future declines in
    our stock price, as well as any marked decline in our level of
    revenues or gross margins, increase the risk that goodwill and
    intangible assets may become impaired in future periods. We
    cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any
    impairment of assets.

While
    we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, we are exposed to risks from legislation
    requiring companies to evaluate those internal
    controls.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our
    management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest
    to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and
    process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these
    requirements. We have and will continue to incur significant
    expenses and devote management resources to Section 404
    compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that our chief
    executive officer (“CEO”), chief financial officer
    (“CFO”), or independent registered public accounting
    firm determine in the future that, our internal controls over
    financial reporting are not effective as defined under
    Section 404, investor perceptions may be adversely affected
    and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock.

Regulation
    of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating
    results and future prospects.

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and our
    business and financial condition could be adversely affected by
    changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications
    industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that
    apply directly to access to or commerce on IP networks. We could
    be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce
    in any country where we operate. Such regulations could address
    matters such as voice over the Internet or using IP, encryption
    technology, and access charges for service providers. In
    addition, regulations have been adopted with respect to
    environmental matters, such as the WEEE and RoHS regulations
    adopted by the European Union, as well as regulations
    prohibiting government entities from purchasing security
    products that do not meet specified local certification
    criteria. Compliance with such regulations may be costly and
    time-consuming for us and our suppliers and partners. The
    adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease
    demand for our products, and at the same time could increase the
    cost of building and



selling our products as well as impact our ability to ship
    products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely
    manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The
    investment of our cash balance and our investments in government
    and corporate debt securities are subject to risks, which may
    cause losses and affect the liquidity of these
    investments.

At December 31, 2009, we had $1,604.7 million in cash
    and cash equivalents and $1,054.0 million in short- and
    long-term investments. We have invested these amounts primarily
    in U.S. government securities, government-sponsored
    enterprise obligations, foreign government debt securities,
    corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market
    funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are
    subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate
    risks, which may be exacerbated by

U.S. sub-prime

mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the
    financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These
    market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a
    negative adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition,
    and results of operations.

Uninsured
    losses could harm our operating results.

We self-insure against many business risks and expenses, such as
    intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit
    programs, where we believe we can adequately self-insure against
    the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either
    not deemed cost-effective or is not available. We also maintain
    a program of insurance coverage for various types of property,
    casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with
    various carriers in numerous jurisdictions. The types and
    amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and
    from location to location, depending on availability, cost, and
    our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are
    subject to deductibles, policy limits, and exclusions that
    result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance
    basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and
    unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations.

In March 2008, the Board approved a stock repurchase program
    (the “2008 Stock Repurchase Program”) which authorized
    us to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock.
    During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2009,
    we repurchased and retired 8,127,263 shares and
    20,696,771 shares of common stock at an average price of
    $26.14 and $21.91 per share, respectively, under the 2008 Stock
    Repurchase Program. All shares of common stock purchased under
    the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program have been retired. Future
    share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs will be
    subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time
    and will be made from time to time in private transactions or
    open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other
    legal requirements. This program may be discontinued at any time.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Report”), including the “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” contains forward-looking statements regarding
    future events and the future results of Juniper Networks, Inc.
    (the “Company”) that are based on current
    expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the
    industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of
    our management. Words such as “expects,”
    “anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,”
    “projects,” “would,” “could,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
    “seeks,” “estimates,” variations of such
    words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such
    forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are
    only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and
    assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual
    results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed
    in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or
    contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to,
    those discussed in this Report under the section entitled
    “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I and
    elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the SEC,
    specifically the most recent reports on

Form 10-Q.

While forward-looking statements are based on reasonable
    expectations of our management at the time that they are made,
    you should not rely on them. We undertake no obligation to
    revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any
    reason.

The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated
    Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which
    have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). In
    the course of operating our business, we routinely make
    decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the
    collection of receivables, the manufacturing, and shipment of
    products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies,
    and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other
    matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the
    financial results for any given period. In making these
    decisions, we consider various factors including contractual
    obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and
    external financial targets and expectations, and financial
    planning objectives. The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an ongoing
    basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to
    sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for
    doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially
    goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures
    for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in
    the valuation of stock-based compensation, and litigation. We
    base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
    assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions.

To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods
    covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview
    and a summary of the significant events that affected the most
    recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our
    operating expenses. These sections should be read in conjunction
    with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations in
    this Item 7, our “Risk Factors” section included
    in Item 1A of Part I, and our audited consolidated
    financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of
    Part II of this report.

Changes
    to Previously Announced Fiscal 2009 Fourth Quarter and U.S. GAAP
    Annual Results

Subsequent to the January 28, 2010 announcement of our
    preliminary fourth quarter and full fiscal year results for
    2009, we recorded additional litigation settlement charges of
    $169.3 million in our reported results. On February 5,
    2010, we entered into a proposed agreement in principle to the
    federal securities class action litigation pending against us
    and certain of our current and former officers and directors
    relating to our historical stock option granting practices. This
    litigation settlement charge resulted in an increase in total
    operating expense and a reduction in operating income, income
    before income taxes and noncontrolling interest, provision for
    income taxes, consolidated net income, net income attributable
    to Juniper Networks, and net income per share attributable to
    Juniper Networks. See further discussion in Note 13,

Commitments and Contingencies

, under “Legal
    Proceedings” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Executive
    Overview

Our performance for the fiscal year 2009 reflects the weakness
    in market demand for networking and security products, compared
    to the fiscal year 2008, primarily due to our customers’
    reaction to the weakened global economy. The decrease in
    revenues was primarily due to the slowdown in the Europe, Middle
    East, and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific
    (“APAC”) service provider market. While the global
    economy continues to challenge the marketplace, our
    portfolio-selling strategy enabled us to expand our depth and
    breadth in the enterprise and service provider markets during
    the second half of 2009. As a result, the fourth quarter of 2009
    was our strongest quarter in the enterprise market as well as in
    the service provider market in the U.S. In addition, we
    were able to navigate through challenging economic conditions by
    controlling operating costs while continuing to invest in
    innovation and customer satisfaction.

The following table provides an overview of our key financial
    metrics for the years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008 (in

•

Net Revenues:

Our net revenues decreased in
    2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced demand for our
    products particularly in the Infrastructure segment, which is
    consistent with the overall decline in the global economy,
    partially offset by an increase in service revenue from both the
    Infrastructure and SLT segments. Net revenues from enterprise
    customers increased 11% while net revenues from service
    providers decreased 14% in 2009, compared to 2008. Net revenues
    decreased in all regions in 2009 compared to 2008.

•

Operating Income:

Our operating income as well
    as operating margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased in
    2009 compared to 2008. These decreases were, in large part, due
    to the decrease in revenues and an increase in litigation
    settlement charges, partially offset by our efforts to control
    expenses and improve operational efficiencies in 2009 compared
    to 2008.

•

Net Income Attributable to Juniper Networks and Net Income
    Per Share Attributable to Juniper Networks Common Stock
    Holders:

The decrease in net income attributable
    to Juniper Networks (“net income”) and net income per
    share attributable to Juniper Networks common stock holders
    (“net income per share”) in 2009 compared to 2008, is
    primarily due to a decrease in revenue, an increase in
    litigation settlement charges, and total non-recurring income
    tax charges of $118.5 million incurred during 2009. Of the
    $118.5 million, $61.8 million related to the write-off
    of certain net deferred tax assets resulting from a change in
    California income tax law, $52.1 million related to a
    change in the tax treatment of stock-based compensation expense
    in transfer pricing arrangements for certain
    U.S. multinational companies due to a recent federal
    appellate court ruling and $4.6 million related to an
    investigation by the India tax authorities.

•

Other Financial Highlights:

Total deferred
    revenue increased $163.3 million in 2009, primarily due to
    the growth in our installed equipment base for maintenance and
    customer support contracts and an increase in channel inventory.
    In 2009, we repurchased approximately 20.7 million shares
    of our common stock under our 2008 Stock Repurchase Program, at
    an average price of $21.91 per share for a total purchase price
    of $453.5 million.

Business
    and Market Environment

We design, develop, and sell products and services that together
    provide our customers with high-performance network
    infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments
    for accelerating the deployment of services and applications
    over a single network. We serve the high-performance networking
    requirements of global service providers, enterprises, and
    research and public sector organizations that view the network
    as critical to their success. High-performance networking is
    designed to provide fast, reliable, and secure access to
    applications and services at scale. We offer a high-performance
    network infrastructure that includes IP routing, Ethernet
    switching, security, and application acceleration solutions, as
    well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network
    and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer
    investments.

In 2009, we continued to deliver new and innovative,
    high-performance network infrastructure solutions. We extended
    our Junos software platform to include Junos Space network
    application platform and Junos Pulse integrated, multi-service
    network client. The launch of our next generation silicon, Trio,
    enables

3-D

scaling and positions our MX-series routers as a
    “universal” edge platform for the networking market.
    We announced the TX Matrix Plus, a multi-chassis system for
    the T1600 core router, which in conjunction with the JCS12000
    Control Plane System brings virtualization to the core of the
    Internet. Additionally, we announced a significant technological
    advance with 100 Gigabit Ethernet interface cards for our T1600
    core router. We also delivered our Adaptive Threat Management
    solution, designed to help customers identify and respond to
    security incidents to help reduce overall risk. We introduced a
    new solution for the Intelligent Services Edge with the
    StreamScope eRM integrated video monitoring and analysis
    product, which is designed to enable customers to extend the
    capabilities of our M- and MX-series routers to enhance the
    quality of video services over cable, wireless, and Internet
    Protocol Television networks.

Our Ethernet switching portfolio added the EX2200 switch
    platform, the EX8208, a modular switching platform, and the
    EX8216, a high-capacity modular switching platform designed for
    deployment in large enterprise data centers. In addition, our
    next-generation network infrastructure includes four new models
    of our SRX family of dynamic services gateways. We expanded our
    SRX family of dynamic services gateways with the introduction of



the SRX3000, and extended the infrastructure for enterprises and
    started shipping the SRX100 dynamic service gateway platforms.
    Our SRX services gateways are sold into service provider and
    mobile packet core security markets as well as the enterprise
    market.

On the partnership front, we announced entry into OEM agreements
    with Dell to offer our networking solutions under Dell’s
    PowerConnect brand, and with IBM to resell our Ethernet
    networking products and support to IBM’s data center
    customers. In addition we entered in to a joint venture with
    Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. (“NSN”) to develop and
    resell joint carrier Ethernet solutions.

The recent weakness in the global economy has affected the
    purchasing behavior of our customers, particularly among service
    providers, and caused delays or reductions in purchase
    decisions, which led to lower revenues in 2009 compared to 2008,
    as well as limited visibility regarding future business. If
    economic growth in the U.S. and other countries’
    economies declines

and/or

fails
    to recover, our customers may further delay or reduce their
    purchases, which could result in reductions in sales of our
    products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new
    technologies, and increased price competition. We continue to
    plan to both invest in key R&D projects that we believe
    will lead to future growth and remain focused on continuing our
    efforts to contain other costs and allocate resources
    effectively.

Nature of
    Expenses

Most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain operations
    are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers.
    Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments
    to our independent contract manufacturers for standard product
    costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our
    products using design specifications, quality assurance
    programs, and standards that we establish. Our independent
    contract manufacturers manufacture our products primarily in
    China, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States. We have
    employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who
    manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our
    supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. As of
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, we had 244 and
    230 employees, respectively, in our manufacturing and
    operations organization that primarily manage relationships with
    our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor
    and manage product testing and quality. We generally do not own
    the components and title to products transfers from the contract
    manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon
    shipment.

The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build
    forecasts, and if actual component usage is lower than our
    forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for
    carrying or obsolete material charges.

In recent years, an increasing amount of our products has been
    manufactured in Asia, and we anticipate that a larger percentage
    of our products will be produced outside the U.S in the future.
    Our contracts generally provide for passage of title and risk of
    loss at the designated point of shipment to our customer. The
    manufacturing of products in Asia for shipment to customers in
    EMEA and the Americas resulted in additional shipment logistics,
    freight, and timing issues for us as well as those customers. In
    an ongoing effort to balance our and our customers’ needs,
    we have made changes on occasion to the payment of freight and
    the point of shipment with respect to products shipped from
    Asia. These changes affect shipping costs and the timing of
    revenue recognition of those shipments.

Our operating expenses include R&D, sales and marketing,
    and G&A expenses. R&D expenses include costs of
    developing our products from components to prototypes to
    finished products, costs for outside services such as
    certifications of new products, and expenditures associated with
    equipment used for testing. Several components of our R&D
    effort require significant expenditures, such as the development
    of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the
    timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses.
    We expense our R&D costs as they are incurred. Sales and
    marketing expenses include costs for selling and promoting our
    products and services, demonstration equipment, and
    advertisements. These costs vary

quarter-to-quarter

depending on revenues, product launches, and marketing
    initiatives. We have an extensive distribution channel in place
    that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have
    made substantial investments in our distribution channel during
    2009, 2008, and 2007. G&A expenses include professional
    fees, bad debt provisions, and other corporate expenses.
    Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting, and
    certain corporate strategic services.



Employee-related costs have historically been the primary driver
    of our cost of service revenue and operating expenses, and we
    expect this trend to continue. Employee-related costs include
    items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits,
    stock-based compensation, and travel. We had 7,231, 7,014, and
    5,879 employees as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively. The

year-over-year

increases were primarily attributable to increases in our
    R&D and customer service organizations. Our headcount is
    expected to increase in 2010 as we continue to expand these
    functions.

Facility and information technology (“IT”)
    departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on
    usage and headcount, respectively. Despite an increase in
    headcount in 2009, these costs decreased due to our cost
    reduction initiatives. Facilities and IT departmental costs
    increased in 2008 and 2007, due to increases in headcount and
    new facility leases added to support our growth. Facility and IT
    related headcount was 294, 267, and 224 as of December 31,
    2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In 2010, we expect to
    continue to invest in our company-wide IT infrastructure as we
    implement our operational excellence initiatives.

Our cost of service revenues and operating expenses are
    denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign
    currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee,
    and Japanese Yen. Changes in related currency exchange rates may
    affect our operating results. Periodically, we use foreign
    currency forward

and/or

option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to cost of service revenues and operating
    expenses. The effective portion of the derivative’s gain or
    loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), and, upon occurrence of the
    forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the
    appropriate line item of the consolidated statement of
    operations to which the hedged transaction relates. Any
    ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other
    income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations.
    The decrease in cost of service revenues and operating expenses
    including R&D, sales and marketing, as well as G&A
    expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately
    2% in 2009. The increase in cost of service revenues and
    operating expenses including R&D, sales and marketing, as
    well as G&A expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations
    was approximately 1% and 2% in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Other
    Event — Listing on the New York Stock
    Exchange

On October 6, 2009, we submitted an application to transfer
    the listing of our Company’s common stock to the NYSE from
    NASDAQ. Effective October 29, 2009, we transferred our
    listing from NASDAQ to the NYSE under the symbol
    “JNPR.”

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures
    in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying
    notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts,
    historical experience, and various other factors that we believe
    are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the
    carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
    apparent from other sources. Note 1,

Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies

, in Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

describes the significant accounting policies and methods used
    in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
    critical accounting policies described below are significantly
    affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting
    policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and
    estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and actual results could differ materially from the
    amounts reported based on these policies. To the extent there
    are material differences between our estimates and the actual
    results, our future consolidated results of operations may be
    affected.

Revenue Recognition.

Our products are
    generally integrated with software that is essential to the
    functionality of our equipment. Additionally, we provide
    unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated
    software through our maintenance contracts for most of our
    products. Accordingly, we account for revenue in accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic

985-605,

Software — Revenue Recognition

(formerly,
    Statement of Position

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition)

.



Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have
    been met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists.

We generally rely upon sales contracts,
    or agreements and customer purchase orders, to determine the
    existence of an arrangement.

•

Delivery has occurred

.  We use shipping terms
    and related documents or written evidence of customer
    acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance.
    In instances where we have outstanding obligations related to
    product delivery or the final acceptance of the product, revenue
    is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have
    been met.

•

Sales price is fixed or determinable.

We
    assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on
    the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to
    refund or adjustment.

•

Collectability is reasonably assured.

We
    assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the
    customer as determined by our credit checks and the
    customer’s payment history. We record accounts receivable
    net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer
    returns, and pricing credits.

For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of
    products that include services, we allocate revenue to each
    element using the residual method based on the vendor-specific
    objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value of the
    undelivered items. Under the residual method, the amount of
    revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total
    arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any
    undelivered elements. VSOE of fair value is based on the price
    charged when the element is sold separately. We then recognize
    revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for
    product and service revenue recognition. In determining VSOE, we
    require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall
    within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends
    for specific products and services. If VSOE of fair value of one
    or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue is deferred
    and recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of those
    elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless
    maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the
    entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
    contractual support period. We account for multiple agreements
    with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual
    terms

and/or

substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so
    closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single
    arrangement. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may
    be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than
    fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the
    future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers.

For sales to direct end-users, value-added resellers, and OEM
    partners, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title
    and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our
    practice to identify an end-user prior to shipment to a
    value-added reseller or to an OEM partner. For our end-users and
    value-added resellers, there are no significant obligations for
    future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits.
    Our agreements with our OEM partners may allow future rights of
    returns or pricing credits. A portion of our sales is made
    through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing
    credits or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on
    sales made through these distributors upon sell-through as
    reported to us by the distributors. Deferred revenue on
    shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor
    pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be
    realized upon sell-through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of
    the related product costs of revenue.

We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns
    and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection,
    in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The
    amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns
    and price protection credits, specific criteria included in
    rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Should
    actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our
    estimates, additional reductions to revenue may be required. In
    addition, we report revenue net of sales taxes.

Service revenues include revenue from maintenance, training, and
    professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable
    contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is
    deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support
    period, which is generally one to three years. Revenue from
    training and professional services is recognized as the services
    are completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is
    generally one year or less.



We sell certain interests in accounts receivable on a
    non-recourse basis as part of a customer financing arrangement
    primarily with one major financing company. We record cash
    received under this arrangement in advance of revenue
    recognition as short-term debt.

•

Contract Manufacturer Liabilities.

We
    outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain
    management operations to our independent contract manufacturers
    and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of
    payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure
    components and manufacture our products based on our demand
    forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future
    demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical
    trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing
    organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We
    establish a provision for inventory, carrying costs, and
    obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased
    based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and
    product demand are significantly lower than forecasted, which
    may be caused by factors outside of our control, it could have
    an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Supply
    chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk
    of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order
    to reduce lead times.

•

Warranty Costs.

We generally offer a one-year
    warranty on all of our hardware products and a

90-day

warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the
    products. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of
    sales based on associated material costs, labor costs for
    customer support, and overhead at the time revenue is
    recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily based upon the
    historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the
    warranty period. Technical support labor and overhead cost are
    estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to
    support the customer cases within the warranty period. Although
    we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
    use of materials, technical labor costs, and associated overhead
    incurred. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials,
    or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, we may
    incur additional warranty costs, which could reduce gross margin.

•

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.

We
    make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating
    impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing
    basis, as well as when valuing goodwill and other intangible
    assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation
    of an acquired entity. The amounts and useful lives assigned to
    identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of
    future amortization expense. The value of our intangible assets,
    including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes
    such as: (i) future declines in our operating results,
    (ii) a sustained decline in our market capitalization,
    (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the
    networking industry, or (iv) failure to meet our forecasted
    operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis
    as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of
    impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential
    impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is subjective and
    requires significant judgment at many points during the
    analysis. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit
    level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying value,
    including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The
    fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a
    combination of the income approach and the market approach.
    Under the market approach, we estimate fair value of our
    reporting units based on market multiples of revenue or earnings
    for comparable companies. Under the income approach, we
    calculate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present
    value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets
    assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not
    required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of
    the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair
    value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second
    step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied
    fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the
    carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
    implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to
    the difference. We performed impairment test for our goodwill as
    of November 1, 2009, 2008 and 2007, and concluded that
    there was no goodwill impairment, or reporting units at risk of
    failing the first step of the impairment test. Intangible assets
    are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
    may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its
    carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is
    expected to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired,
    the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the
    carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.



We assess the recoverability of our intangible assets by
    determining whether the unamortized balances are greater than
    the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows of the related
    assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on
    projected discounted future net cash flows. The estimates we
    have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we
    use to manage our business. If our actual results or the plans
    and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than
    the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of
    these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.

•

Stock-Based Compensation.

We recognize
    stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment
    awards including employee stock options, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”), performance share awards, and purchases
    under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with FASB
    ASC Topic 718 (formerly, Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”)). Stock-based
    compensation expense for

expected-to-vest

stock-based awards is valued under the single-option approach
    and amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated
    forfeitures.

We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”)
    option-pricing model in order to determine the fair value of
    stock-based awards. The BSM model requires various highly
    subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option
    life, and risk-free interest rate. The expected volatility is
    based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our
    common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including
    historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent
    period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our
    stock options. The expected life of an award is based on
    historical experience, the terms and conditions of the stock
    awards granted to employees, as well as the potential effect
    from options that have not been exercised at the time.

The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of
    share-based payment awards represent management’s best
    estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and
    the application of management’s judgment. If factors change
    and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation
    expense could be materially different in the future. In
    addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture
    rate and recognize expense only for those

expected-to-vest

shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different
    from our estimate, our recorded stock-based compensation expense
    could be different.

•

Income Taxes.

Estimates and judgments occur in
    the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the
    determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax
    assets, which arise from temporary differences and
    carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
    using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable
    income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are
    expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the
    likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from
    recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income
    based on the realization criteria set forth in FASB ASC
    Topic —

Income Taxes

(“FASB ASC Topic
    740”) (formerly, SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

and Financial Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109)

. To the extent that we
    believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized,
    we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax
    assets. We believe it is more likely than not that future income
    from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and forecasted
    income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining
    deferred tax assets. In the event we determine that all or part
    of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future,
    an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to
    earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if
    we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously
    determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation
    allowance would be reversed, resulting in an adjustment to
    earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition,
    the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
    uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We
    recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon criteria
    set forth in FASB ASC Topic 740. Based upon these criteria, we
    estimate whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will
    be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be
    unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax
    benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the
    liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax
    liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a
    further charge to expense would result.

Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation
    allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the
    need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available
    evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future
    taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.
    In the event that we change our



determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can
    be realized, as occurred in connection with the California tax
    law change in the first quarter of 2009, we will adjust our
    valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision
    for income taxes in the period in which such determination is
    made. For further discussion of the California tax law change
    refer to Note 12,

Income Taxes

, in Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our
    uncertain tax positions under FASB ASC Topic 740 and determining
    our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves
    under FASB ASC Topic 740 are reasonable, no assurance can be
    given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be
    different from that which is reflected in our historical income
    tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light
    of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a
    tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that
    the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the
    amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for
    income taxes in the period in which such determination is made
    as it was during the second quarter of 2009, when we recorded a
    non-recurring income tax charge as a result of a federal
    appellate court ruling in

Xilinx, Inc. v.
    Commissioner

. The provision for income taxes includes the
    effect of reserves under FASB ASC Topic 740 and any changes to
    the reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the
    related net interest and penalties, if applicable.

•

Loss Contingencies.

We are subject to the
    possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the
    ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss
    or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as
    well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss,
    in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency
    is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired
    or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. We record a charge equal to the minimum
    estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency
    only when both of the following conditions are met:
    (i) information available prior to issuance of our
    consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable
    that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred
    at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range
    of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate
    current information available to us to determine whether such
    accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are
    required.

From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and
    other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current
    litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties
    associated with any litigation, and these actions or other
    third-party claims against us may cause us to incur costly
    litigation

and/or

substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of
    any future intellectual property litigation may require us to
    make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross
    margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur,
    our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
    cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in
    any such matters may be materially different from our estimates,
    which could result in the need to adjust our liability and
    record additional expenses.

Our net product revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008
    primarily due to decreased revenue from our routing products to
    service provider customers whose spending patterns were affected
    by the weakened global economy, partially offset by increased
    revenues from our EX-series switching products. Our net service
    revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to
    the increase in professional services and maintenance revenue
    from our expanding installed base of equipment under service
    contracts.

Our net product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily due to increased sales of products from both our
    Infrastructure and SLT solutions to the service provider and
    enterprise markets. In particular, we had success in selling our
    Infrastructure products to service providers who are adopting
    next generation IP networks, which are designed for higher
    capacity and efficiency to help reduce total operating costs and
    to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. In
    2008, our new product releases and further expansion into
    emerging markets contributed to the increase in total net
    product revenues. Our net service revenues increased in 2008,
    compared to 2007, primarily due to the increase in maintenance
    revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under
    service contracts.

Infrastructure
    Segment Revenues

Our Infrastructure segment consists primarily of products and
    services related to the E-, M-, MX-, and T-series router product
    families, EX-series switching products, as well as

circuit-to-packet

products. The following table presents net Infrastructure
    segment revenues and net Infrastructure segment revenues as a

Infrastructure —
    Product

Infrastructure product revenues decreased in 2009 compared to
    2008, primarily due to decreased revenue in

M-, T-,

and

E-series

product families attributable to our customers’ reduced
    demand due to the global economic environment, partially offset
    by revenue growth from our EX-series switching products and
    MX-series products. In 2009, we experienced a 23% decrease in
    product revenue from the service provider market and a 40%
    increase in product revenue from the enterprise market compared
    to the same period in 2008. The decrease in the service provider
    market was primarily due to decreased capital spending in that
    market, and the increase in the enterprise market was primarily
    due to the growth in our EX-series switching business and our
    continued focus on selling Infrastructure products into the
    enterprise market, which resulted in growth of enterprise
    revenues in Americas and APAC. Geographically, Infrastructure
    product revenue decreased in all three regions in 2009.

Infrastructure product revenues increased in 2008 compared to
    2007, primarily attributable to revenue growth from our
    M- MX- and T-series product families, from sales to both
    the service provider and enterprise markets due to our
    customers’ increased demand for network infrastructure
    solutions. To a lesser extent, our EX-series products, which
    were introduced in the first quarter of 2008, and our

E-series

products also contributed to the revenue growth in 2008. In
    2008, we experienced a 28% increase in product revenue from the
    service provider market and a 59% increase in product revenue
    from the enterprise market compared to the same period in 2007.
    From a geographical perspective, in 2008, we experienced revenue
    growth in all three regions, with particular strength in the
    Americas region.

We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped
    to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential
    network growth. Most of our Infrastructure product platforms are
    modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform.
    Each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are
    available to be populated with components we refer to as modules
    or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the
    platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of
    transmission media. The physical connection between a
    transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The
    number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the
    functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis
    revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue
    was recognized during the period. The following table presents
    Infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped:

Infrastructure chassis revenue units decreased in 2009 compared
    to 2008, primarily due to reduced customer demand because of the
    weakened global economy. The port shipments increased in 2009
    compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in the MX-series
    products, which generally contain a higher number of ports per
    chassis.

Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2008 compared
    to 2007, primarily due to the product mix that favored higher
    capacity chassis revenue units, which was driven by bandwidth
    demand as our customers sought to expand capabilities in their
    networks and to offer differentiating, feature-rich, multi-play
    services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues.
    The port shipments also increased in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily due to the increase in the overall number of chassis
    revenue units from richly configured T- and M-series router
    chassis revenue units shipped during the 2008 period.

Infrastructure —
    Service

Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2009 compared to
    2008, primarily due to an increase in our installed base of
    equipment being serviced and service renewals. In 2009, we
    experienced a 12% increase in service revenue from the service
    provider market and a 30% increase in service revenue from the
    enterprise market



compared to the same period in 2008. Geographically,
    Infrastructure service revenue increased in all regions in 2009.
    A majority of our service revenues is earned from customers that
    purchase our products and enter into service contracts for
    support service.

Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2008 compared to
    2007, primarily due to an increase in our installed base of
    equipment being serviced. Installed base is calculated based on
    the number of systems that our customers have under maintenance.
    In 2008, we experienced a 37% increase in service revenue from
    the service provider market and a 3% increase in service revenue
    from the enterprise market compared to the same period in 2007.
    We also experienced increased professional service revenues due
    to consulting projects. From a geographical perspective, in
    2008, we experienced revenue growth in all three regions, with
    particular strength in the Americas region.

SLT
    Segment Revenues

Our SLT segment consists primarily of products and services
    related to our Firewall/VPN (“Firewall”) systems and
    appliances, SRX Series services gateways, SSL VPN appliances,
    IDP appliances, the J-series router product family, and WAN
    optimization platforms. The following table presents net SLT

SLT —
    Product

SLT product revenues was relatively flat in 2009 compared to
    2008, primarily due to an increase in revenue from our SRX
    services gateways offset by a decrease in revenue from our
    high-end and branch firewall products. In 2009, we experienced a
    26% increase in revenue from the service provider market and a
    8% decrease in revenue from the enterprise market compared to
    2008. Geographically, SLT product revenue decreased in the EMEA
    and APAC regions and increased in the Americas region.

SLT product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to an increase in revenues from Firewall and
    J-series products. These increases were partially offset by a
    decline in revenues from DX and WX products. The integrated
    systems introduced prior to 2007, such as the SSG products,
    gained further traction in the market place with revenues from
    these product lines growing in 2008 compared to 2007. In 2008,
    we experienced a 1% increase in revenue from the service
    provider market and a 8% increase in revenue from the enterprise
    market compared to 2007. Geographically, revenues increased in
    the EMEA and APAC regions and decreased in the Americas region.

SLT revenue units decreased in 2009 compared to 2008. The
    percentage decrease in revenue units was greater than the
    percentage decrease in SLT product revenues, primarily due to
    the product mix that favored products with higher average
    selling prices. SLT revenue units increased slightly in 2008
    compared to 2007. The percentage increase in SLT revenue units
    was lower than the percentage increase in product revenues,
    primarily due to the product mix that favored products with
    higher average selling prices.

SLT —
    Service

SLT service revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008,
    primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment
    being serviced and service renewals. In 2009, we experienced a
    20% increase in service revenue from the service provider market
    and a 10% increase in service revenue from the enterprise market
    compared to 2008. Geographically, SLT service revenue increased
    in all regions in 2009. A majority of our service revenues is
    earned from customers that purchase our products and enter into
    support service contracts.

SLT service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment
    being serviced. In 2008, we experienced a 33% increase in
    service revenue from the service provider market and a 24%
    increase in service revenue from the enterprise market compared
    to 2007. Geographically, SLT service revenue increased in all
    regions in 2008.

Net revenues in the Americas region decreased in absolute
    dollars, but increased as a percentage of total net revenues in
    2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a revenue decrease from
    the service provider market, partially offset by an increase in
    net revenues from the enterprise market. In particular, the
    United States, Mexico, and Brazil accounted for more than half
    of the decline in net revenue in the Americas region. Net
    revenues in the Americas region increased in absolute dollars
    and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2008 compared to
    2007, primarily due to growth in Infrastructure revenues from
    both the service provider and enterprise markets, as our
    customers continued to focus on increasing network performance,
    reliability, and scale. In the United States, net revenues
    decreased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of
    total net revenues, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to
    the relative strength of sales in the United States compared to
    EMEA and APAC. In the United States, net revenues increased in
    absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues, in
    2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to growth in revenues from
    both the service provider and enterprise markets.

Net revenues in EMEA decreased in absolute dollars and as a
    percentage of total net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008,
    primarily due to reduced demand in the service provider market,
    partially offset by a slight



increase in revenue from the enterprise market. In particular
    Sweden, Germany, Belgium, and United Kingdom attributed more
    than half of the decline in net revenues in EMEA. Net revenues
    in EMEA increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to revenue growth in emerging markets in the
    Middle East and Eastern Europe, which was driven by service
    provider network build-outs as a result of bandwidth demand as
    well as growth in demand in the enterprise market. Net revenues
    in EMEA as a percentage of total net revenues decreased in 2008
    compared to 2007, primarily due to the relative strength of the
    Americas region.

Net revenues in APAC decreased in absolute dollars in 2009
    compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced demand in the service
    provider, partially offset by a slight increase in revenue from
    the enterprise market. In particular, over half of the decline
    in APAC net revenues was attributable to Japan. Net revenues in
    APAC as a percentage of total net revenues decreased slightly,
    primarily due to the relative strength of the enterprise market
    in the United States. Net revenues in APAC increased in absolute
    dollars in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to strength in
    Japan, China, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
    (“ASEAN”) countries, which was mainly driven by
    bandwidth demand as well as our customers’ deployment of
    routing platforms for their next generation networks, partially
    offset by a decrease in revenues from Australia.

Net
    Revenues by Markets and Customers

We sell our high-performance network products and service
    offerings from both the Infrastructure and SLT segments to two
    primary markets — service provider and enterprise. The
    service provider market includes wireline, wireless, and cable
    operators, as well as major internet content and application
    providers. The enterprise market represents businesses; federal,
    state and local governments; and research and education
    institutions. The following table presents the total net

Net revenues from the service provider market decreased in
    absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in
    2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to our customers’
    delayed investment in new network build-outs and purchases of
    additional networking capacity in reaction to the weak global
    macroeconomic environment. The decline in service provider
    revenue as a percentage of net revenues was also attributable to
    the relative strength of our revenue from the enterprise market.
    Net revenues from the service provider market increased in
    absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in
    2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to service provider network
    build-outs as a result of bandwidth demand.

Net revenues from the enterprise market increased in absolute
    dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2009
    compared to 2008, primarily due to revenue growth from our
    EX-series switching products. Net revenues from the enterprise
    market increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of
    total net revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to
    our strategy of cross-selling to the enterprise market and the
    introduction of our SRX service gateways and our EX-series
    switching products.

AT&T, Inc., accounted for 10.4% of our net revenues for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. No single customer accounted
    for 10% or more of our net revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. NSN accounted for 12.8% of our net
    revenues in 2007.

The cost of product revenues and product gross margin decreased
    in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to
    lower revenue level. The decrease in product gross margin as a
    percentage of revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, is primarily
    attributable to product mix that favored products with lower
    gross margin, such as our switching and MX-series products,
    geographical mix, and pricing. The cost of product revenues
    increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to our increase in product revenues, which
    resulted in higher product costs. The slight decrease in product
    gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in 2008
    compared to 2007, is primarily attributable to changes in the
    product mix, partially offset by growth in our higher-margin T-
    and M-series product families within our Infrastructure segment
    and increased sales of our higher-margin Firewall and J-series
    products within our SLT segment.

The cost of service revenues and service gross margin increased
    in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in cost of service
    revenues was attributable to increased headcount and increased
    spending on service-related spares. Service gross margin
    increased primarily due to our continued efforts to manage
    costs. The cost of service revenues and service gross margin
    increased in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase corresponded
    with the growth in revenues in absolute dollars attributable to
    the growth in our installed equipment base. Service-related
    headcount increased by 108 employees, or 14%, to
    891 employees in 2009, compared to 783 in 2008. Total
    personnel-related charges as a percentage of service revenues
    were approximately 18% for 2009 and 20% for 2008. The decrease
    in personnel-related charges in 2009 as a percentage of service
    revenues is primarily due to the overall increase in service
    revenues. Our outside service expense also increased in 2009,
    primarily to support the expanding installed equipment base.
    Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to cost of
    service revenues increased in connection with the growth of
    service business as a portion of our overall operations.

R&D expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily
    due to additional headcount and strategic initiatives to expand
    our product portfolio and maintain our technological advantage
    over competitors. In particular, in 2009, we continued to expand
    our EX-series switching product portfolio and increased our
    investments in Project Stratus, which is our initiative to
    deliver the next-generation data center fabric, and Project
    Falcon, which is our effort to develop mobility solutions for
    service provider customers. Personnel-related charges,
    consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits expenses, and
    stock-based compensation expenses, increased $25.6 million,
    or 6%, to $453.3 million in 2009 primarily due to a 4%
    increase in headcount in our engineering organization, from
    3,194 to 3,308 employees, to support product innovation
    intended to capture anticipated future network infrastructure
    growth and opportunities. Outside consulting and other
    development expense also increased to support our product
    innovation initiatives. Additionally, facilities and IT expenses
    related to R&D expenses increased to support these
    engineering efforts.

R&D expenses increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily
    due to strategic initiatives to expand our product portfolio and
    maintain our technological advantage over our competitors. In
    particular, in 2008, we continued to invest in our EX-series
    switching products, our SRX dynamic services gateways, and our
    intelligent services edge offering that advances the M- and
    MX-series platforms. R&D expenses primarily consist of
    personnel-related expenses and new product development costs.
    Personnel-related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe
    benefits expenses, and stock-based compensation expenses,
    increased $59.3 million, or 16%, to $435.2 million in



2008 primarily due to a 25% increase in headcount in our
    engineering organization, from 2,563 to 3,194 employees, to
    support product innovation intended to capture anticipated
    future network infrastructure growth and opportunities. Outside
    consulting and other development expense also increased to
    support our product innovation initiatives. Additionally,
    facilities and IT expenses related to R&D expenses
    increased to support these engineering efforts.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased in 2009 compared to 2008,
    primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses and
    travel expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and
    marketing expenses increased slightly in 2009 due to the
    increased spending related to the corporate re-branding and
    channel marketing campaigns, partially offset by our focus on
    managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales
    activities. Personnel-related charges, consisting of salaries,
    commissions, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock-based
    compensation expenses, decreased $15.8 million, or 3%, to
    $474.0 million in 2009, primarily due to a 4% decrease in
    headcount from 2,190 employees at the end of 2008 to
    2,101 employees at the end of 2009. In addition, commission
    expense decreased by $12.0 million, or 10%, due to lower
    net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008. As our sales force
    decreased, we also decreased facilities and IT expenses related
    to the sales and marketing organizations in 2009 compared to
    2008.

Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses and
    marketing expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and
    marketing expenses decreased in 2008 due to our focus on
    managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales
    activities. Personnel-related charges, consisting of salaries,
    commissions, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock-based
    compensation expenses, increased $70.8 million, or 17%, to
    $497.2 million in 2008, primarily due to an 18% increase in
    headcount in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations,
    from 1,863 to 2,190 employees. Included in
    personnel-related charges was an increase in commission expense
    of $5.3 million in 2008 compared to 2007, due to our higher
    net revenues. We also increased our investment in corporate and
    channel marketing efforts from the prior year. As our sales
    force grew, we also increased facilities and IT expenses related
    to the sales and marketing organizations in 2008 compared to
    2007.

G&A expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily
    due to an increase in personnel-related expenses and outside
    professional services. As a percentage of net revenues, G&A
    expenses decreased slightly in 2009 due to our focus on managing
    expenses. Personnel-related charges, consisting of salaries,
    bonus, fringe benefits, and stock-based compensation expenses,
    increased $7.2 million, or 10%, to $78.4 million in
    2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a 12% increase in
    headcount, from 350 to 393 employees, in our worldwide
    G&A functions to support expected future growth of the
    business. Outside professional service fees increased in 2009
    compared to 2008 as a result of increased legal fees.
    Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to our G&A
    infrastructure increased to support our growing business.

G&A expenses also increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses and
    outside professional services. As a percentage of net revenues,
    G&A expenses decreased slightly in 2008 due to our focus on
    managing expenses and growing revenues. Personnel-related
    charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits, and
    stock-based compensation expenses, increased $12.4 million,
    or 21%, to $71.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to a 20% increase in headcount in our worldwide
    G&A functions, from 291 to 350 employees, to support
    the overall growth of the business. Outside professional service
    fees increased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of
    increased legal fees and business process re-engineering costs.
    Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to our G&A
    infrastructure increased to support our growing business.

Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2009
    compared to 2008, primarily due to certain purchased intangible
    assets reaching the end of their amortization period during the
    second quarter of 2009. Amortization of purchased intangible
    assets decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a
    decrease in amortization expense as certain purchased intangible
    assets became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2008.
    We had no impairment against our goodwill or our purchased
    intangible assets in 2009. In 2008, we had no impairment against
    our goodwill and recognized an impairment charge of
    $5.0 million against our purchased intangible assets, as a
    result of the phase-out of our DX products. We had no impairment
    against our goodwill or our purchased intangible assets in 2007.



In 2009, we recorded litigation settlement charges of
    $182.3 million, which included $169.0 million related
    to our agreement in principle reached in February 2010, to
    settle the securities class action litigation pending against us
    and certain of our current and former officers and directors,
    $13.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute in
    connection with certain real estate in Sunnyvale California
    purchased in 2000 and $0.3 million related to another
    settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Of these
    amounts, $181.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter
    of 2009. In 2008, we recorded a litigation settlement loss of
    $9.0 million related to our shareholder derivative lawsuit.
    In 2007, we recognized a net litigation settlement gain of
    $5.3 million, which consisted of cash settlement proceeds
    of $6.2 million, net of the $0.9 million legal expense
    related to direct transaction costs incurred. See Note 13,

Commitments and Contingencies

, in Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

for more information.

In 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $19.5 million
    as a result of a restructuring plan to reduce our real estate
    portfolio and workforce in targeted areas of the Company. We
    expect to incur additional charges of approximately
    $8 million to $10 million relating to additional
    facilities and employee restructuring under the 2009
    Restructuring Plan in 2010. There were no restructuring charges
    in 2008. In 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of
    $0.7 million, of which $1.1 million pertained to bonus
    accruals associated with past acquisitions, partially offset by
    a benefit of $0.4 million pertaining to net restructuring
    adjustments. See Note 6,

Other charges are summarized as follows:

•

Stock Option Investigation Costs.

There were
    no stock option investigation costs recorded in 2009 and 2008.
    We recorded expenses of $6.0 million in 2007 related to
    professional fees and other costs in connection with our
    investigation into historical stock option granting practices.

•

Stock Option Amendment and Tax-Related
    Charges.

There were no stock option amendment and
    tax-related charges recorded in 2009 and 2008. We recorded
    $8.0 million in operating expense during 2007 in relation
    to the amendment of stock options and to the payment of certain
    taxes and penalties associated with employee stock option
    exercises.

Net interest and other income decreased in 2009 compared to
    2008, primarily due to lower interest rates and an increase in
    customer financing charges during 2009. Net interest and other
    income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to
    lower interest rates during 2008.

During 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairment losses of
    $5.5 million and $14.8 million, respectively, on our
    investments in privately-held companies for changes in fair
    value that we believed were

other-than-temporary.

In 2007, one of the companies in which we had a privately-held
    equity investment completed an initial public



offering (“IPO”). As a result, we realized a gain of
    $6.7 million during 2007 based upon the difference between
    the market value of our investment at the time of the IPO and
    our cost basis.

Our effective tax rates were 63.1%, 29.8%, and 29.3% in 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively. The increase in the overall rate
    in 2009 compared to 2008 and the federal statutory rate of 35%,
    was primarily due to the following income tax charges:
    (i) a $61.8 million discrete and other related charge
    that resulted from changes in California income tax laws that
    were enacted during 2009; (ii) a $52.1 million charge
    that resulted from a change in our unrecognized tax benefits
    related to share-based compensation due to the uncertainty
    regarding the status of a decision reached by the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Xilinx
    Inc. v. Commissioner; and (iii) a $4.6 million
    charge which related to an investigation by the India tax
    authorities. The effective rate impact from these charges was
    partially offset by the federal R&D credit and the benefit
    of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower
    tax rates. The increase in the overall rate in 2008 compared to
    2007, was primarily due to the differences in the geographic mix
    of our taxable income and the level of R&D credits in the
    U.S. The 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates differ from the
    federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the federal
    R&D credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign
    jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates.

For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the
    U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation
    of our income tax provision, see Note 12,

Infrastructure
    Segment

An analysis of the change in revenues for the Infrastructure
    segment, and the change in revenue units, can be found above in
    the section titled “Net Revenues.”

Infrastructure segment operating income decreased in 2009
    compared to 2008, primarily due to a decrease in revenues in M-,
    T- and

E-series

product families due to reduced demand in the service provider
    market in reaction to the weak global economic environment,
    partially offset by revenue growth from EX-series switching
    products as well as MX-series products. Infrastructure product
    gross margin in absolute dollars and as a percentage
    Infrastructure revenue decreased in 2009, compared to 2008,
    primarily due to product mix and pricing.



In 2009, we continued to invest in R&D efforts to expand
    our Infrastructure product portfolio and to continue our
    innovation of products. We will continue to make investments to
    expand our product features and functionality based upon the
    trends in the marketplace. R&D expense as a percentage of
    Infrastructure net revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008,
    primarily due to lower net revenues relative to expenses.
    Additionally, our sales and marketing expenses increased
    slightly as a percentage of Infrastructure net revenues in 2009
    compared to 2008, as we increased our efforts to reach
    enterprise and service provider customers. We allocate sales and
    marketing, G&A, as well as facility and IT expenses to the
    Infrastructure segment generally based upon revenue, usage, and
    headcount.

Infrastructure segment operating income increased in 2008
    compared to 2007, primarily due to revenue growth from our
    router product families and, to a lesser extent, our new
    Ethernet switching product family, which outpaced expense
    growth. Infrastructure product gross margin increased in
    absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to
    revenues from richly configured high-end T- and M-series router
    products as well as high-margin port shipments. The
    Infrastructure gross margin percentage decreased slightly in
    2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to product mix,
    particularly from an increase in the mix of lower-margin

E-series

products in 2008.

SLT
    Segment

An analysis of the change in revenues for the SLT segment, and
    the change in units, can be found above in the section titled
    “Net Revenues.”

SLT segment operating income increased in 2009 compared to 2008,
    primarily due to the 3% growth in SLT revenues driven by product
    and service revenue increases, while lowering expenses through
    cost control initiatives and engineering effectiveness measures.
    SLT gross margin in absolute dollars and as a percentage of SLT
    revenue increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an
    increase in service margin.

R&D related costs as a percentage of SLT net revenues
    decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to our cost
    control initiatives and the growth in net revenues relative to
    expenses. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses also
    decreased as a percentage of SLT net revenues in 2009 compared
    to 2008, primarily due to the growth in SLT net revenues and
    reductions in discretionary spending. We allocate sales and
    marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and
    information technology expenses to the SLT segment generally
    based on revenue, usage, and headcount. In the past, we have
    generally experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in
    the demand for our SLT products, particularly in the fourth
    quarter, which may result in greater variations in our quarterly
    operating results.

SLT segment operating income increased in 2008 compared to 2007,
    primarily due to revenue growth in our Firewall and J-series
    products and the growth in our installed equipment base for
    service contracts, which outpaced the increase in SLT expenses.
    SLT product gross margin and gross margin percentage increased
    in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to product mix,
    particularly from an increase in the mix of higher-margin
    Firewall and

J-series

products in 2008.

Stock-Based
    Compensation and Related Payroll Taxes

Stock-based compensation expense increased in 2009 compared to
    2008, primarily attributable to new stock option and RSU grants
    during 2009 and an increase in performance-based RSU grants as a
    result of the strong operating results in the fourth quarter of
    2009. Stock-based compensation related payroll tax expense,
    which represents employment taxes we incurred in connection with
    our employee stock programs, decreased in 2009 compared to 2008.
    The decrease in payroll tax expense was primarily attributable
    to the timing and lower volume of stock options exercises by our
    employees in 2009 due to the lower share price during the year.
    Stock-based compensation expense increased in 2008 compared to
    2007, primarily due to new stock options and RSU grants during
    2008 and the timing of the recognition of stock-based
    compensation expense for RSUs granted in the last month of the
    fourth quarter of 2007. Stock-based compensation related payroll
    tax expense decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of
    the decrease in our share price during 2008.

ratio represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by
    product revenues during the respective period.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our
    consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows,
    contractual obligations, and our stock repurchase program on our
    liquidity and capital resources.

Overview

Historically, we have funded our business primarily through our
    operating activities and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of
    our common stock. The following table shows our capital
    resources (in millions, except percentages):

The significant components of our working capital are cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts
    receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities,
    and deferred revenue. The decrease in working capital from
    December 31, 2008, to December 31, 2009, is primarily
    due to the increase in short term deferred revenue, partially
    offset by the increase in short-term investments. Total cash,
    cash equivalents, and investments increased in 2009, primarily
    due to net cash generated from operations, partially offset by
    cash used in our common stock repurchases and fixed asset
    investments.

Stock
    Repurchase Activities

In March 2008, the Board approved the 2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to
    $1.0 billion of our Company’s common stock. Under this
    program, we repurchased 20.7 million shares of our common
    stock at an average price of $21.91 per share for a total
    purchase price of $453.5 million in 2009. As of
    December 31, 2009, the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program had
    remaining authorized funds of $318.6 million.

In 2008, we repurchased $604.7 million or 25.1 million
    shares of common stock at an average price of $24.10 per
    share under the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program and the
    $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved



in 2006 and 2007 (the “2006 Stock Repurchase
    Program”). As of December 31, 2008, the 2006 Stock
    Repurchase Program had no remaining authorized funds available
    for future stock repurchases.

All shares of common stock purchased under the 2006 and 2008
    Stock Repurchase Programs have been retired.

In addition, in February 2010, our Board approved a new stock
    repurchase program (the “2010 Stock Repurchase Program
    ”) under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.0
    billion of our Company’s common stock. Future share
    repurchases under our stock repurchase programs will be subject
    to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and will
    be made from time to time in private transactions or open market
    purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal
    requirements. These programs may be discontinued at any time.

for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2010.

Summary
    of Cash Flows

In the year ended December 31, 2009, cash and cash
    equivalents decreased by $414.4 million. This decrease was
    the result of cash used in our investing and financing
    activities of $948.3 million and $262.2 million,
    respectively, partially offset by cash that was generated from
    our operating activities of $796.1 million.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $796.1 million, $875.2 million, and
    $786.5 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The
    cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to
    our consolidated net income adjusted by:

•

Non-cash charges of $299.5 million, $255.8 million,
    and $257.5 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
    These non-cash charges primarily related to depreciation and
    amortization expenses, stock-based compensation, deferred income
    taxes, gain/loss on equity investments, and excess tax benefits
    from employee stock-based compensation.

•

Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of
    $381.3 million, $107.6 million, and
    $168.2 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, were
    generated in the normal course of business. These changes were
    primarily due to increases in deferred revenue, income tax
    payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities,
    partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. The
    increase in deferred revenue was due to the increase in product
    revenue yet to be recognized and the growing installed base
    which resulted in additional support contracts. The increase in
    income taxes payable was due to the increase in the tax
    provision and the timing of payments. The increase in accrued
    compensation was due to our variable compensation and bonus
    program. The increase in other accrued liabilities was primarily
    due to the increase in the accrual for litigation settlements.
    In 2009, the Company accrued $169.0 million for a proposed
    settlement of our securities class action lawsuit reached in
    February 2010, which was paid prior to the filing of this
    report. These increases in cash flows from operations were
    partially offset by a negative cash flow due to an increase in
    net accounts receivable, which was primarily due to the growth
    in our business and net revenues. In 2008 and 2007, positive
    cash flows from operating assets and liabilities were due to
    increases in deferred revenue and income taxes payable.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $948.3 million
    for 2009 as compared to net cash generated by investing
    activities of $149.8 million in 2008. In 2007, cash
    generated by investing activities was $571.8 million. The
    changes between periods were primarily due to the movement of
    cash from short- and long-term investments to cash and cash
    equivalents as the result of the Company’s investment
    strategy.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $262.2 million,
    $422.4 million, and $1,238.5 million for 2009, 2008,
    and 2007, respectively. In 2009, we used $453.9 million to
    repurchase our common stock through our 2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program and, to a lesser extent, from our employees in
    connection with net issuance of shares to satisfy our tax
    withholding obligations for vesting of certain RSU and
    performance share awards, partially offset by cash proceeds of
    $164.2 million from common stock issued to employees and
    proceeds of $4.4 million from non-



controlling interest. In 2008, we used $604.7 million for
    common stock repurchases, partially offset by cash proceeds of
    $119.5 million from common stock issued to employees. In
    2007, we used $1,623.2 million to repurchase our common
    stock, partially offset by cash proceeds of $355.0 million
    from common stock issued to employees.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31,
    2009, and 2008.

Contractual
    Obligations

Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations
    outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, tax
    liabilities, and other contractual obligations. The following
    table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of
    December 31, 2009, and the effect such obligations are
    expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future
    periods (in millions):

Our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily
    relate to our leased facilities under our non-cancelable
    operating leases. Rent payments are allocated to costs and
    operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.
    We occupy approximately 2.0 million square feet worldwide
    under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in
    North America, including our corporate headquarters in
    Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in November
    2022.



Guarantees

We have entered into agreements with some of our customers that
    contain indemnification provisions relating to potential
    situations where claims could be alleged that our products
    infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party.
    Other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include
    guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees
    related to third-party customer financing arrangements and
    standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. As of
    December 31, 2009, we had $34.0 million in guarantees
    and standby letters of credit and recorded a liability of
    $21.9 million related to a third-party customer-financing
    guarantee. As of December 31, 2008, we had not recorded a
    liability related to our guarantees and indemnification
    arrangements.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resource Requirements

Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating
    activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic
    relationships we may make in the future. Additionally, if we
    were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under
    our stock repurchase programs, our liquidity may be impacted. As
    of December 31, 2009, we have over 50% of our cash and
    investment balances held outside of the U.S., which may be
    subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe
    that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
    long-term investments, together with cash generated from
    operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee
    stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase
    plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated
    growth for at least the next 12 months. We believe our
    working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements
    for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity
    requirements associated with our existing operations during the
    same period. However, our future liquidity and capital
    requirements may vary materially from those now planned
    depending on many factors, including:

•

the overall levels of sales of our products, the mix of product
    sales, and gross profit margins;

•

our business, product, capital expenditures, and R&D plans;

•

repurchases of our common stock;

•

incurrence and repayment of debt;

•

litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar
    items related to resolution of tax audits;

•

volume price discounts and customer rebates;

•

the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain;

•

acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products, or
    technologies;

•

changes in our compensation policies;

•

capital improvements for new and existing facilities;

•

our competitors’ responses to our products;

•

our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers;

•

possible future investments in raw material and finished goods
    inventories;

•

expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any;

•

tax expense associated with stock-based awards;

•

issuance of stock-based awards and the related payment in cash
    for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during
    future years;

•

the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases
    under our equity incentive plans; and

•

general economic conditions and specific conditions in our
    industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in
    global credit and financial markets, international conflicts,
    and related uncertainties.



ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types,
    and maturities. The value of our investments are subject to
    market price volatility. In addition, as of December 31,
    2009, over 50% of our cash and marketable securities are held in

non-U.S. domiciled

countries. Our marketable securities are generally classified as

available-for-sale

and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance
    sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as
    a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss).

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material
    adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
    Conversely, a decline in interest rates could have a material
    impact on interest income from our investment portfolio. We do
    not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. We recognized
    immaterial gains and losses during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, related to the sales of
    our investments.

The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value
    of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2009, and
    2008, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes
    other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the
    changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in
    interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical
    parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus
    50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS,
    which are representative of the historical movements in the
    Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign
    Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations
    in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for
    speculative or trading purposes.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate
    variability in gains and losses generated from the
    re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are
    carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income
    (expense) in the same period as the changes in the



fair value from the re-measurement of the underlying assets and
    liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of
    approximately two months.

Our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily
    denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our cost of service revenue
    and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as
    well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound,
    the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Periodically, we use
    foreign currency forward

and/or

option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to cost of service revenue and operating
    expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges
    and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion
    of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and,
    upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently
    reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements
    of operations to which the hedged transaction relates. We record
    the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was
    immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008,
    and 2007, respectively, in other income (expense) on our
    consolidated statements of operations. The decrease in operating
    expenses including cost of service revenue, R&D, sales and
    marketing, and G&A expenses, due to foreign currency
    fluctuations was approximately 2% in 2009. In 2008 and 2007, the
    increase in cost of service revenue, operating expenses
    including R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A, due to
    foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1% and 2%,
    respectively.

Equity
    Price Risk

Our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities is inherently
    exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. We
    monitor our publicly-traded equity investments for impairment on
    a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of a
    public-traded equity investment exceeds its fair value, and we
    determine the decline in value to be other than temporary, we
    reduce the carrying value to its current fair value. In 2008, we
    realized an impairment charge of $3.5 million on a
    publicly-traded equity security due to a sustained decline, in
    excess of six months, in the fair value of the investment below
    its cost basis that we judged to be other than temporary. There
    was no such charge in 2009. We do not purchase our
    publicly-traded equity securities with the intent to use them
    for trading or speculative purposes. They are classified as

available-for-sale

securities on our consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate
    fair value of our marketable equity securities was
    $5.4 million and $4.4 million as of December 31,
    2009, and 2008, respectively. Additionally, our non-qualified
    deferred compensation (“NQDC”) plan may also hold
    publicly traded securities. Investments under the NQDC plan are
    considered trading securities and are reported at fair value on
    our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2009,
    and 2008, the total investments under the NQDC plan was
    $4.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. A
    hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our
    portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities would result in
    an immaterial loss.

Our investments in privately-held companies are carried at cost.
    In 2009 and 2008, we realized an impairment charge of
    $5.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively, on
    minority equity investments in privately-held companies that we
    judged to be other than temporary as discussed in Note 4,

Fair Value Measurements

, in Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The aggregate cost of our investments in privately-held
    companies was $13.9 million and $14.2 million as of
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Juniper Networks, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Juniper Networks, Inc. at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Juniper Networks, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited Juniper Networks, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Juniper Networks,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 of Juniper Networks, Inc. and our report
    dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the
    “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    for the Company. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision
    of the Company’s principal executive and principal
    financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    Company’s financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets
    that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the framework set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.

Based on that assessment, management concluded
    that, as of December 31, 2009, the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, has been
    audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent
    registered public accounting firm that audits the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report
    preceding this report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or the
    “Company”) designs, develops, and sells innovative
    products and services that together provide its customers with
    high-performance network infrastructure that creates responsive
    and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of
    services and applications over a single network. The Company has
    the following two segments: Infrastructure and Service Layer
    Technologies (“SLT”). The Infrastructure segment
    primarily offers scalable Internet Protocol
    (“IP”)-router and Ethernet switching products that are
    used to control and direct network traffic. The SLT segment
    offers networking solutions that meet a broad array of its
    customers’ priorities, from securing the network and the
    data on the network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and
    acceleration of applications across a distributed network. Both
    segments offer worldwide services, including technical support
    and professional services, as well as educational and training
    programs to their customers.

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements, which include the Company
    and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in accordance
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“U.S. GAAP”). All inter-company balances and
    transactions have been eliminated. The information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be read in conjunction with “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” “Risk Factors,” and
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

In 2009, the Company held a majority interest in a joint venture
    with Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. (“NSN”). As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company owned a 60 percent
    interest in the joint venture. Given the Company’s majority
    ownership interest in the joint venture, the accounts of the
    joint venture have been consolidated with the accounts of the
    Company, and a noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the
    noncontrolling investor’s interests in the net assets and
    operations of the joint venture.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related
    disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the
    Company to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and the accompanying notes. The Company bases its
    estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical
    experience, and various other factors that it believes are
    reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. The critical accounting policies described
    below are significantly affected by critical accounting
    estimates. Such accounting policies require significant
    judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements and actual results could
    differ materially from the amounts reported based on these
    policies. To the extent there are material differences between
    our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated
    results of operations may be affected.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with an original
    maturity of three months or less are classified as cash and cash
    equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand,
    demand deposits with banks, highly liquid investments in money
    market funds, commercial paper, government securities,
    certificates of deposit, and corporate debt securities, which
    are readily convertible into cash.

Investments
    in Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities

Management determines the appropriate classification of
    securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such
    classification as of each balance sheet date. The Company’s
    investments in publicly-traded debt and equity

securities are classified as available-for-sale.
    Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at cost
    and periodically adjusted to fair value in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments
    are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses and
    declines in value judged to be other than temporary are
    determined based on the specific identification method and are
    reported in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company recognizes an impairment charge for
    available-for-sale investments when a decline in the fair value
    of its investments below the cost basis is determined to be
    other than temporary. The Company considers various factors in
    determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including
    the length of time the investment has been in a loss position,
    the extent to which the fair value has been less than the
    Company’s cost basis, the investment’s financial
    condition, and near-term prospects of the investee. If the
    Company determines that the decline in an investment’s fair
    value is other than temporary, the difference is recognized as
    an impairment loss in its consolidated statements of operations.

The Company’s non-qualified compensation plan, which
    invests in mutual funds are classified as trading securities and
    reported at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The
    realized and unrealized holding gains and losses, as well as the
    offsetting compensation expense, are reported in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Privately-Held
    Equity Investments

The Company has minority equity investments in privately-held
    companies. These investments are included in other long-term
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are carried at
    cost, adjusted for any impairment, as the Company does not have
    a controlling interest and does not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over these companies. These investments
    are inherently high risk as the market for technologies or
    products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage
    at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets
    may never be significant. The Company monitors these investments
    for impairment by considering financial, operational, and
    economic data and makes appropriate reductions in carrying
    values when necessary. Realized gains and losses, if any, are
    reported in the consolidated statements of operations.

Fair
    Value Measurement

The Company records its financial instruments and derivative
    contracts at fair value. The fair value assumes that the
    transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in
    the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the
    absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for
    the asset or liability. The carrying value of the Company’s
    financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,
    accounts receivable, accrued compensation, and other accrued
    liabilities, approximates fair market value due to the
    relatively short period of time to maturity. The fair value of
    investments is determined using quoted market prices for those
    securities or similar financial instruments.

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations
    of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
    investments, and accounts receivable. The Company invests only
    in high-quality credit instruments and maintains its cash, cash
    equivalents, and available-for-sale investments in fixed income
    securities, and money market funds with high-quality
    institutions. Deposits held with banks, including those held in
    foreign branches of global banks, may exceed the amount of
    insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be
    redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk.

Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
    diversified due to the number of entities comprising the
    Company’s customer base and their dispersion across
    different geographic locations throughout the world. The Company
    performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
    generally does not require collateral on accounts



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

    Statements — (Continued)

receivable. The Company maintains reserves for potential bad
    debt and historically such losses have been within
    management’s expectations. AT&T, Inc., accounted for
    10.4% of the Company’s total net revenues for 2009. No
    single customer accounted for more than 10% of the
    Company’s total net revenues for 2008, and NSN accounted
    for 12.8% of total net revenues during 2007.

The Company relies on sole suppliers for certain of its
    components such as ASICs and custom sheet metal. Additionally,
    the Company relies primarily on a limited number of significant
    independent contract manufacturers for the production of all of
    its products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to
    fulfill supply requirements of the Company could negatively
    impact future operating results.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
    method over the lesser of the estimated useful life, generally
    one and a half to five years, or the lease term of the
    respective assets. The Company depreciates leasehold
    improvements over the lesser of the expected life of the lease
    or the assets, up to a maximum of ten years. Land is not subject
    to depreciation.

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
    fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets
    resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using
    the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management
    based on the fair value of assets received. Identifiable
    intangible assets are comprised of purchased trademarks,
    developed technologies, customer relationships, maintenance
    contracts, and other intangible assets. Goodwill is not subject
    to amortization but is subject to annual assessment, at a
    minimum, for impairment by applying fair-value based tests.
    Future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to
    earnings. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective
    estimated useful lives ranging from two to nineteen years.

Impairment

The Company evaluates long-lived assets held for use for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An
    asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the
    future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If an
    asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    asset exceeds its fair value. The Company assesses the
    recoverability of its long-lived and intangible assets by
    determining whether the unamortized balances are greater than
    the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows of the related
    assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on
    projected discounted future net cash flows.

The Company evaluates goodwill, at a minimum, on an annual basis
    and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by
    comparing the reporting unit’s carrying value, including
    goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair
    values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination
    of the income approach and the market approach. If the carrying
    value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is
    considered impaired, and a second step is performed to measure
    the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The Company conducted
    its annual impairment test as of November 1, 2009, 2008,
    and 2007, and determined that the carrying value of its
    remaining goodwill was not impaired. Future impairment
    indicators, including sustained declines in the Company’s
    market capitalization or a decrease in revenue or profitability
    levels, could require additional impairment charges to be
    recorded.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s products are generally integrated with
    software that is essential to the functionality of the
    equipment. Additionally, the Company provides unspecified
    upgrades and enhancements related to the integrated software
    through maintenance contracts for most of its products. Revenue
    is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists.

The Company generally relies upon sales
    contracts, or agreements, and customer purchase orders to
    determine the existence of an arrangement.

•

Delivery has occurred.

The Company uses
    shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of
    customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or
    performance. In instances where the Company has outstanding
    obligations related to product delivery or the final acceptance
    of the product, revenue is deferred until all the delivery and
    acceptance criteria have been met.

•

Sales price is fixed and determinable.

The
    Company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or
    determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales
    price is subject to refund or adjustment.

•

Collectability is reasonably assured.

The
    Company assesses collectability based on the creditworthiness of
    the customer as determined by our credit checks and the
    customer’s payment history. The Company records accounts
    receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated
    customer returns and pricing credits.

For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of
    products that include services, the Company allocates revenue to
    each element using the residual method based on the
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair
    value of the undelivered items. Under the residual method, the
    amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the
    total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of
    any undelivered elements. VSOE of fair value is based on the
    price charged when the element is sold separately. The Company
    then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance with
    our policies for product and service revenue recognition. In
    determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the
    selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on
    historical discounting trends for specific products and
    services. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered items
    does not exist, revenue is deferred and recognized at the
    earlier of: (i) delivery of those elements or
    (ii) when fair value can be established unless maintenance
    is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire
    arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual
    support period. The Company accounts for multiple agreements
    with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual
    terms

and/or

substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so
    closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single
    arrangement. The ability to recognize revenue in the future may
    be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than
    fair value. In addition, the Company’s ability to recognize
    revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by
    its customers.

For sales to direct end-users, value-added resellers, and OEM
    partners, the Company recognizes product revenue upon transfer
    of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It
    is the Company’s practice to identify an end-user prior to
    shipment to a value-added reseller or to an OEM partner. For the
    Company’s end-users and value-added resellers, there are no
    significant obligations for future performance such as rights of
    return or pricing credits. The Company’s agreements with
    its OEM partners may allow future rights of returns or pricing
    credits. A portion of the Company’s sales are made through
    distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or
    rights of return. Product revenue on sales made through these
    distributors is recognized upon sell-through as reported by the
    distributors to the Company. Deferred revenue on shipments to
    distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits
    and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon
    sell-through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related
    product costs of revenue.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated product
    returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price
    protection, in the same period that the related revenue is
    recorded. The amount of these reductions



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

is based on historical sales returns and price protection
    credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and
    other factors known at the time. Should actual product returns
    or pricing adjustments differ from estimates, additional
    reductions to revenue may be required. In addition, the Company
    reports revenues net of sales taxes.

Service revenues include revenue from maintenance, training, and
    professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable
    contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is
    deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support
    period, which is generally one to three years. Revenue from
    training and professional services is recognized as the services
    are completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is
    generally one year or less.

The Company sells certain interests in accounts receivable on a
    non-recourse basis as part of a customer financing arrangement
    primarily with one major financing company. Cash received under
    this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition is recorded
    as short-term debt.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the
    Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer
    accounts. The Company regularly reviews its receivables that
    remain outstanding past their applicable payment terms and
    establishes allowance and potential write-offs by considering
    factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of
    the accounts receivable balances, and current economic
    conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.

Warranty
    Costs

Juniper Networks generally offers a one-year warranty on all of
    its hardware products and a

90-day

warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the
    products. The Company accrues for warranty costs as part of its
    cost of sales based on associated material costs, labor costs
    for customer support, and overhead at the time revenue is
    recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily based upon the
    historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the
    warranty period. Technical support labor and overhead cost are
    estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to
    support the customer cases within the warranty period. Although
    we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,
    our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
    use of materials, technical labor costs, and associated overhead
    incurred. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials,
    or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, we may
    incur additional warranty costs, which could reduce gross margin.

Contract
    Manufacturer Liabilities

The Company outsources most of its manufacturing, repair, and
    supply chain management operations to its independent contract
    manufacturers, and a significant portion of its cost of revenues
    consists of payments to them. The independent contract
    manufacturers procure components and manufacture the
    Company’s products based on the Company’s demand
    forecasts. These forecasts are based on the Company’s
    estimates of future demand for the Company products, which are
    in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from the
    Company’s sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for
    overall market conditions. The Company establishes a provision
    for inventory carrying costs and obsolete material exposures for
    excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the
    actual component usage and product demand are significantly
    lower than forecasted, which may be caused by factors outside of
    the Company’s control, it could have an adverse impact on
    the Company’s gross margins and profitability. Supply chain
    management remains an area of focus as the Company balances the
    risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in
    order to reduce lead times.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Research
    and Development

Costs to research, design, and develop the Company’s
    products are expensed as incurred. Software development costs
    are capitalized beginning when a product’s technological
    feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
    available for general release to customers. Generally, the
    Company’s products are released soon after technological
    feasibility has been established. As a result, costs subsequent
    to achieving technological feasibility have not been
    significant, and all software development costs have been
    expensed as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as
    incurred. Advertising expense was $11.4 million,
    $5.0 million, and $4.8 million, for 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

Loss
    Contingencies

The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss
    contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.
    Management considers the likelihood of loss related to an asset,
    or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to
    reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss
    contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it
    is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
    estimated. The Company records a charge equal to the minimum
    estimated liability or a loss contingency only when both of the
    following conditions are met: (i) information available
    prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements
    indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or
    a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial
    statements, and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably
    estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information
    available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted
    and whether new accruals are required.

From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes,
    litigation, and other legal actions. The Company is aggressively
    defending its current litigation matters. However, there are
    many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these
    actions or other third-party claims against the Company may
    cause the Company to incur costly litigation

and/or

substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of
    any future intellectual property litigation may require the
    Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect
    gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to
    occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, results
    of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The
    actual liability in any such matters may be materially different
    from the Company’s estimates, which could result in the
    need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all
    share-based payment awards including employee stock options,
    restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance share
    awards, and purchases under the Company’s Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) Topic 718 (“ASC Topic 718”)
    (formerly SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

). Stock-based compensation expense for
    expected-to-vest stock-based awards is valued under the
    single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis,
    net of estimated forfeitures. The value of the portion of the
    award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
    expense over the requisite service periods in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007.

We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”)
    option-pricing model in determining the fair value of
    stock-based awards. The BSM model requires various highly
    subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option
    life, and risk-free interest rate. The expected volatility is
    based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our
    common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including
    historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent
    period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our
    stock options. The expected life of an



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

award is based on historical experience, the terms and
    conditions of the stock awards granted to employees, as well as
    the potential effect from options that have not been exercised
    at the time.

The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of
    share-based payment awards represent management’s best
    estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and
    the application of management’s judgment. If factors change
    and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation
    expense could be materially different in the future. In
    addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture
    rate and recognize expense only for those expected-to-vest
    shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different
    from our estimate, our recorded stock-based compensation expense
    could be different.

Derivatives

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its market
    exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. The
    Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or
    trading purposes.

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate
    variability in gains and losses generated from the
    re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are
    carried at fair value with changes recorded in interest and
    other income, net. Changes in the fair value of these
    derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the
    underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such
    derivatives are classified as operating activities. These
    foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of
    approximately two months.

The Company also uses foreign currency forward or option
    contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
    transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives
    are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less
    than one year. The effective portion of the derivative’s
    gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), and upon occurrence of the
    forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the
    operating expense line item to which the hedged transaction
    relates. The Company records any ineffectiveness of the hedging
    instruments, which was immaterial during 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    in interest and other income, net, on its consolidated
    statements of operations. Cash flows from such hedges are
    classified as operating activities.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax
    liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of
    certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary
    differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates
    that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which
    those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The
    Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax
    assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or
    recovered from future taxable income based on the realization
    criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic —

Income Taxes

(“FASB ASC Topic 740”) (formerly,
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

and
    Financial Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

). To the extent that the Company believes any
    amounts are not more likely than not to be realized, the Company
    records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets.
    The Company believes it is more likely than not that future
    income from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and
    forecasted income will be sufficient to fully recover the
    remaining deferred tax assets. In the event the Company
    determines that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are
    not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation
    allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such
    determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently
    realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to
    be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be
    reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period
    such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax
    liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
    application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes
    potential liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and the
    extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity
    during a period from transactions and other events and
    circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company has presented
    its comprehensive income (loss) as part of its consolidated
    statements of stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive
    income (loss) includes net unrealized gains (losses) on
    available-for-sale securities and net foreign currency
    translation gains (losses) that are excluded from net income,
    and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives designated as cash
    flow hedges.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations with

functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars using
    exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and
    expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars using
    weighted-average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency
    translation gains and losses were not material for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. The effect of
    exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign
    currencies was immaterial in the years presented.

. The revised
    guidance eliminates the qualifying special-purpose entities
    (“QSPE”) concept, amends the provisions on determining
    whether an entity is a variable interest entity and would
    require consolidation, and requires additional disclosures. This
    guidance is effective for each entity’s first annual
    reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for
    interim periods within the first annual reporting period, and
    for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Earlier
    application is prohibited. Accordingly, the Company will adopt
    this guidance on January 1, 2010. The impact of adoption on
    the Company’s consolidated results of operations or
    financial condition will depend upon its involvement with
    variable interest entities as of and subsequent to the adoption
    date.

In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-16,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets

which incorporated the revised accounting guidance for the
    transfers of financial assets, initially issued by the FASB in
    June 2009, into FASB ASC Topic 860,

Transfers and
    Servicing

. The revised guidance eliminates the concept of
    QSPE, removes the scope exception for QSPE when applying the
    accounting guidance related to variable interest entities,
    changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and
    requires additional disclosures. This accounting guidance was
    effective for each entity’s first annual and interim
    reporting periods that begin after November 15, 2009. This
    accounting guidance is applied to transfers of financial assets
    occurring on or after the effective date. Earlier application is
    prohibited. The impact of adoption on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations or financial condition will

are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered
    into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or
    after June 15, 2010, and must be adopted in the same period
    using the same transition method. If adoption is elected in a
    period other than the beginning of a fiscal year, the amendments
    in these standards must be applied retrospectively to the
    beginning of the fiscal year. Full retrospective application of
    these amendments to prior fiscal years is optional. Companies
    may elect early adoption of these standards. The Company is
    currently assessing the timing of adoption and evaluating the
    impact ASU

2009-14

and
    ASU

will have on its consolidated results of operations and

In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-05,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic
    820) — Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value

(“ASU

2009-05”),

which amends the fair value measurements of liabilities within
    FASB ASC Topic 820. ASU

2009-05

provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted
    price in an active market for an identical liability is not
    available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value
    using one or more of the following techniques: (1) a
    valuation technique that uses: quoted price of the identical
    liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar
    liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets, or
    (2) another valuation technique that is consistent with the
    principles of FASB ASC Topic 820. The guidance in ASU

2009-05

was
    effective for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning
    after issuance. The adoption of ASU

2009-05

has
    no material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations or financial condition.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2,

Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary
    Impairments

(“FSP

FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2”),

which was subsequently incorporated into FASB ASC Topic 320,

Investments — Debt and Equity Securities

. ASC
    320 amended other-than-temporary accounting of debt securities
    to make it more operational and to improve the presentation and
    disclosure of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and
    equity securities. These provisions were effective for interim
    and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009.
    The Company’s adoption of ASC 320 did not affect its
    consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Net
    Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net income
    per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential
    common shares that were outstanding during the period on a
    weighted average basis. Dilutive potential common shares consist
    of shares issuable upon conversion of senior notes, if any, and
    various employee stock awards, including common shares issuable
    upon exercise of stock options, vesting of RSUs, and vesting of
    performance shares.

The Company had no impairment charges to its publicly-traded
    equity investments in 2009. In 2008, the Company realized an
    impairment charge of $3.5 million on a publicly-traded
    equity security due to a sustained decline in the fair value of
    the investment below its cost basis that the Company judged to
    be other than temporary. No such charges were incurred in 2007.
    There were no material realized gains or losses from the sale of
    available-for-sale securities in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The
    Company generated cash proceeds of $683.8 million,
    $499.4 million, and $1,029.1 million from maturities
    and sales of our available-for-sale investments during 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

The Company had 52 and 26 investments that were in an unrealized
    loss position as of December 31, 2009, and
    December 31, 2008, respectively. The gross unrealized
    losses related to these investments were due to changes in
    interest rates. The contractual terms of these investments do
    not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less
    than the amortized cost of the investment. For fixed income
    securities that have unrealized losses, the Company has
    determined that (i) it does not have the intent to sell any
    of these investments, and (ii) it is not more likely than
    not that it will be required to sell any of these investments
    before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. The Company
    did not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily
    impaired as of December 31, 2009, and December 31,
    2008, respectively. The Company reviews its investments to
    identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of
    possible impairment. The Company aggregates its investments by
    category and length of time the securities have been in a
    continuous unrealized loss position to facilitate its evaluation.

Restricted
    Cash

Restricted cash as of December 31, 2009, consisted of
    escrow accounts required by certain acquisitions completed in
    2005, the D&O indemnification trust, and the India Gratuity
    Trust. The India Gratuity Trust was established in 2008 to cover
    statutory severance obligations in the event of termination of
    its India employees who have provided five or more years of
    continuous service. The D&O trust was established to secure
    the Company’s indemnification obligations to certain
    directors, officers, and other specified employees, arising from
    their activities as such, in the event that the Company does not
    provide or is financially incapable of providing
    indemnification. In 2009, the Company distributed
    $1.0 million of its restricted cash in connection with the
    escrow fund associated with the acquisition of Funk Software.
    The Company also increased its restricted cash by an aggregate
    of $11.3 million to fund both its India Gratuity and
    D&O Trusts due to overall growth of the Company. In 2008,
    the Company made no distributions from restricted cash and
    increased its restricted cash by an aggregate of
    $8.1 million to fund both the India Gratuity and D&O
    Trusts due to overall growth of the Company.

Privately-Held
    Equity Investments

The Company’s minority equity investments in privately-held
    companies are carried at cost as the Company does not have a
    controlling interest and does not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over these companies. The Company adjusts
    its privately-held equity investments for any impairment if the
    fair value exceeds the carrying value of the respective assets.

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, the carrying values of
    the Company’s minority equity investments in privately-held
    companies of $13.9 million and $14.2 million,
    respectively, were included in other long-term assets in the
    consolidated balance sheets. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, the
    Company invested a total of $7.2 million,
    $4.6 million, and $4.1 million, respectively, in
    privately-held companies.

Due to events and circumstances that significantly affected the
    fair value of three of its privately-held equity investments in
    2009, which are normally carried at cost, the Company measured
    the fair value of these privately-held equity investments using
    an analysis of the financial condition and near-term prospects
    of the investees, including recent financing activities and
    their capital structure. As a result, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company recognized a loss of
    $5.5 million due to the impairment of its minority equity
    investments in privately-held companies that the Company judged
    to be other than temporary. In addition, during year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company had a minority equity
    investment of $2.0 million in a privately-held company that
    was acquired by a publicly-traded company for which the Company
    received $1.0 million in cash and $1.0 million in
    common stock of the acquiring company. In 2008, the Company
    recognized losses of $11.3 million due to the impairment of
    minority equity investments in privately-held companies that the
    Company judged to be other than temporary. In addition, the
    Company had a minority equity investment of $2.4 million in
    a privately-held company that was acquired by a third party for
    which the Company received a payment of $2.1 million in
    2008 and $0.3 million in 2009.

Note 4.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair
    Value Hierarchy

The Company determines the fair values of its financial
    instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an
    entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
    use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value
    is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date. The fair
    value assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer
    the liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous
    market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair
    value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
    asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or
    liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level
    input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
    fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels
    that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 — Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 — Inputs are quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are
    observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
    indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the
    full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 — Inputs are unobservable inputs based on
    the Company’s assumptions.

In the year ended December 31, 2009, due to events and
    circumstances that significantly affected the fair value of
    three of its privately-held equity investments, which are
    normally carried at cost, the Company measured the fair value of
    these privately-held equity investments, at the time of
    impairment, using an analysis of the financial condition and
    near-term prospects of the investees, including recent financing
    activities and their capital structure. As a result, the Company
    recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million during the
    year ended December 31, 2009, and classified the
    investments as a Level 3 asset due to the absence of quoted
    market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.

The Company had no liabilities that were measured at fair value
    on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31,
    2009.

In 2009 and 2008, there were no additions to goodwill. In the
    first quarter of 2008, the Company realigned its organizational
    structure to eliminate its Service segment and to include its
    service business into the related Infrastructure and SLT
    segments. As a result, the Company, with the assistance of an
    external service provider, reallocated goodwill of the former
    Service segment to the Infrastructure and SLT segments based on
    a relative fair value approach. Fair value was based on
    comparative market values and discounted cash flows. There was
    no indication of impairment when goodwill was reallocated to the
    new reporting segments.

The Company performed goodwill impairment reviews as of
    November 1, 2009 and 2008, and concluded that there was no
    impairment in the years ended 2009 and 2008.

Restructuring
    Liabilities

During 2009, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (the
    “2009 Restructuring Plan”) in an effort to better
    align its business operations with the current market and
    macroeconomic conditions. The restructuring plan included a
    restructuring of certain business functions that resulted in
    reductions of workforce and facilities. The Company recorded
    $19.5 million in restructuring charges during the year
    ended December 31, 2009, associated with the 2009
    Restructuring Plan. The Company paid $7.5 million for
    severance related charges associated with the 2009 Restructuring
    Plan during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    incurred restructuring charges of nil and $0.7 million,
    respectively, associated with past restructuring plans. The
    Company expects to incur additional charges of approximately
    $8 million to $10 million relating to additional
    facilities and employee restructuring under the 2009
    Restructuring Plan in 2010.

Restructuring charges were based on the Company’s
    restructuring plans that were committed to by management. Any
    changes in the estimates of executing the approved plans will be
    reflected in the Company’s results of

Litigation
    Settlements

In 2009, the Company incurred a $169.0 million expense
    related to the Company’s agreement in principle reached in
    February 2010, to settle the securities class action litigations
    pending against the Company and certain of its current and
    former officers and directors, related to our historical stock
    option granting practices, a $13.0 million expense for a
    legal settlement regarding the Menlo Equity arbitration, and a
    $0.3 million expense related to settlement of another
    matter recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. See Note 13,

Commitments and Contingencies

, under the heading
    “Legal Proceedings.” In 2008, the Company incurred a
    $9.0 million expense for the settlement of its shareholder
    derivative lawsuits. In 2007, the Company recorded a net
    litigation settlement gain of $5.3 million, which consisted
    of cash proceeds of $6.2 million, net of transaction costs
    of $0.9 million.

Other
    Charges

In 2007, the Company incurred $6.0 million in professional
    fees for the costs of external service providers used in the
    completion of its internal stock option investigation. The
    Company did not incur any such costs for 2009 or 2008. In
    addition, the Company recognized stock option amendment and
    tax-related charges of $8.0 million in 2007, pertaining to
    the amendment of stock options and to the settlement with the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for employment tax
    assessments primarily related to the timing of tax deposits
    related to employee stock option exercises. The Company did not
    incur such charges in 2009 or 2008.

Interest income and expense, net, primarily includes interest

    investments, as well as customer financing charges. Other income
    and expense, net, primarily includes foreign exchange gains and
    losses and other miscellaneous expenses such as bank fees.

Note 7.

Financing
    Arrangements

The Company has customer financing arrangements to sell its
    accounts receivable to a major third-party financing provider.
    The program does not and is not intended to affect the timing of
    revenue recognition because the Company only recognizes revenue
    upon sell-through. Under the financing arrangements, proceeds
    from the financing provider are due to the Company 30 days
    from the sale of the receivable. In these transactions with the
    financing provider, the Company has surrendered control over the
    transferred assets. The accounts receivable have been isolated
    from the Company and put beyond the reach of creditors, even in
    the event of bankruptcy. The Company does not maintain effective
    control over the transferred assets through obligations or
    rights to redeem, transfer, or repurchase the receivables after
    they have been transferred.

Pursuant to the financing arrangements for the sale of
    receivables, the Company sold net receivables of
    $449.8 million and $427.2 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. In 2009 and 2008, the Company received cash
    proceeds of $426.3 million and $392.7 million,
    respectively. The amounts owed by the financing provider
    recorded as accounts receivable on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009, and
    December 31, 2008, were $89.8 million and
    $73.9 million, respectively.

The portion of the receivable financed that has not been
    recognized as revenue is accounted for as a financing
    arrangement and is included in other accrued liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2009, and
    December 31, 2008, the estimated amounts of cash received
    from the financing provider that has not been recognized as
    revenue from its distributors was $52.6 million and
    $33.0 million, respectively.

Note 8.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company uses derivatives partially to offset its market
    exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies and does
    not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

Cash
    Flow Hedges

The Company uses foreign currency forward or option contracts to
    hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating
    to cost of services and operating expenses. The derivatives are
    intended to protect the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the
    Company’s planned cost of services and operating expenses
    denominated in foreign currencies. These derivatives are
    designated as cash flow hedges. Execution of these cash flow
    hedge derivatives typically occurs every month with maturities
    of less than one year. The effective portion of the
    derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and
    upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently
    reclassified into the cost of services or operating expense line
    item to which the hedged transaction relates. The Company
    records any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which
    was immaterial during each of the three years ended
    December 31, 2009, in interest and other income, net on its
    consolidated statements of operations. Cash flows from such
    hedges are classified as operating activities. All amounts
    within other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be
    reclassified into income within the next 12 months.

Non-Designated
    Hedges

The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to
    mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the
    re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in foreign currencies. These hedges do not qualify
    for special hedge accounting treatment. These derivatives are
    carried at fair value with changes recorded in interest and
    other income, net. Changes in the fair value of these
    derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the
    underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such
    derivatives are classified as operating activities. The
    derivatives have maturities of approximately two months.

Stock
    Repurchase Activities

In March 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors (the
    “Board”) approved a $1.0 billion stock repurchase
    program (the “2008 Stock Repurchase Program”). Under
    this program, the Company repurchased approximately
    20.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price
    of $21.91 per share for a total purchase price of
    $453.5 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the
    2008 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of
    $318.6 million.

In 2008, the Company repurchased $604.7 million, or
    25.1 million shares of common stock, at an average purchase
    price of $24.10 per share, under the 2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program and the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program
    approved in 2006 and 2007 (the “2006 Stock Repurchase
    Program”). As of December 31, 2008, the 2006 Stock
    Repurchase Program had no remaining authorized funds available
    for future stock repurchases.

All shares of common stock purchased under the 2006 and 2008
    Stock Repurchase Programs have been retired. Future share
    repurchases under the Company’s 2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances in
    place at the time and will be made from time to time in private
    transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities
    laws and other legal requirements. This program may be
    discontinued at any time. See Note 16,

Note 10.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Stock
    Option Plans

    Equity Incentive Plan

On May 18, 2006, the Company’s stockholders adopted
    the Company’s 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006
    Plan”) to enable the granting of incentive stock options,
    nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, restricted stock, stock
    appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units,
    deferred stock units, and dividend equivalents to the employees
    and consultants of the Company. The 2006 Plan also provides for
    automatic, non-discretionary awards of nonstatutory stock
    options and RSUs to the Company’s non-employee members of
    the Board.

The maximum aggregate number of shares authorized under the 2006
    Plan is 64,500,000 shares of common stock, plus the
    addition of any shares subject to outstanding options under the
    Company’s Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Plan (the
    “1996 Plan”) and the Company’s 2000 Nonstatutory
    Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”) to the extent that
    they expire unexercised after May 18, 2006, up to a maximum
    of 75,000,000 additional shares of common stock.

Options granted under the 2006 Plan have a maximum term of seven
    years from the grant date, and generally vest and become
    exercisable over a four-year period. Subject to the terms of
    change of control severance agreements, and except for a limited
    number of shares allowed under the 2006 Plan, restricted stock,
    performance shares, RSUs, or deferred stock units that vest
    solely based on continuing employment or provision of services
    will vest in full no earlier than the three-year anniversary of
    the grant date, or in the event vesting is based on factors
    other than continued future provision of services, such awards
    will vest in full no earlier than the one-year anniversary of
    the grant date.

The 2006 Plan provides each non-employee director an automatic
    grant of an option to purchase 50,000 shares of common
    stock on the date such individual first becomes a director,
    whether through election by the stockholders of the Company or
    appointment by the Board to fill a vacancy (the “First
    Option”). In addition, at each of the Company’s annual
    stockholder meetings (i) each non-employee director who was
    a non-employee director on the



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

date of the prior year’s annual stockholder meeting shall
    be automatically granted RSUs for a number of shares equal to
    the Annual Value (as defined below), and (ii) each
    non-employee director who was not a non-employee director on the
    date of the prior year’s annual stockholder meeting shall
    receive a RSU award for a number of shares determined by
    multiplying the Annual Value by a fraction, the numerator of
    which is the number of days since the non-employee director
    received their First Option, and the denominator of which is
    365, rounded down to the nearest whole share. Each RSU award
    specified in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an
    “Annual Award.” The Annual Value means the number of
    RSUs equal to $125,000 divided by the average daily closing
    price of the Company’s common stock over the six month
    period ending on the last day of the fiscal year preceding the
    date of grant. The First Option vests monthly over approximately
    three years from the grant date subject to the non-employee
    director’s continuous service on the Board. The Annual
    Award shall vest approximately one year from the grant date
    subject to the non-employee director’s continuous service
    on the Board. Under the 2006 Plan, options granted to
    non-employee directors have a maximum term of seven years.

    Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan

In July 2000, the Board adopted the 2000 Plan. The 2000 Plan
    provided for the granting of nonstatutory stock options to
    employees, directors, and consultants. Options granted under the
    2000 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period
    beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten
    years. The Company had authorized 90,901,437 shares of
    common stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Effective
    May 18, 2006, additional equity awards under the 2000 Plan
    were discontinued and new equity awards are being granted under
    the 2006 Plan. Remaining authorized shares under the 2000 Plan
    that were not subject to outstanding awards as of May 18,
    2006, were canceled on May 18, 2006. The 2000 Plan will
    remain in effect as to outstanding equity awards granted under
    the plan prior to May 18, 2006.

Amended
    and Restated 1996 Stock Plan

The 1996 Plan provided for the granting of incentive stock
    options to employees and nonstatutory stock options to
    employees, directors, and consultants. On November 3, 2005,
    the Board adopted an amendment to the 1996 Plan to add the
    ability to issue RSUs under the 1996 Plan. Options granted under
    the 1996 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year
    period beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of
    ten years. The Company had authorized 164,623,039 shares of
    common stock for issuance under the 1996 Plan. Effective
    May 18, 2006, additional equity awards under the 1996 Plan
    were discontinued and new equity awards are being granted under
    the 2006 Plan. Remaining authorized shares under the 1996 Plan
    that were not subject to outstanding awards as of May 18,
    2006, were canceled on May 18, 2006. The 1996 Plan will
    remain in effect as to outstanding equity awards granted under
    the plan prior to May 18, 2006.

Plans
    Assumed Upon Acquisition

In connection with past acquisitions, the Company assumed
    options and restricted stock under the stock plans of the
    acquired companies. The Company exchanged those options and
    restricted stock for Juniper Networks’ options and
    restricted stock and, in the case of the options, authorized the
    appropriate number of shares of common stock for issuance
    pursuant to those options. As of December 31, 2009, there
    were approximately 2.0 million shares of common stock
    subject to outstanding awards under plans assumed through past
    acquisitions. There was no restricted stock subject to
    repurchase as of December 31, 2009, and 2008. There were no
    restricted stock repurchases during 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In April 1999, the Board approved the adoption of Juniper
    Networks 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “1999
    Purchase Plan”). The 1999 Purchase Plan permits eligible
    employees to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock
    through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10% of base
    compensation. Each employee may purchase no more than
    6,000 shares in any twelve-month period, and in no event,
    may an employee purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
    determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time
    such option is granted, in one calendar year. The 1999 Purchase
    Plan is implemented in a series of offering periods, each six
    months in duration, or a shorter period as determined by the
    Board. The price at which the common stock may be purchased is
    85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company’s
    common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period
    or on the last day of the applicable offering period. As a
    result of the Company’s failure to file its Quarterly
    Reports on

Form 10-Q

for the second and third quarters of 2006, the Company had
    suspended its employee payroll withholdings for the purchase of
    its common stock under the 1999 Purchase Plan from August 2006
    through March 2007. In January 2007, the Board approved a delay
    of the start of the offering period from February 1, 2007,
    to April 1, 2007. Such offering period ended on
    July 31, 2007.

In May 2008, the Company’s stockholders approved the
    adoption of the Juniper Networks 2008 Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan (the “2008 Purchase Plan”), which replaced the
    1999 Purchase Plan. The Board has reserved an aggregate of
    12,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for
    issuance under the 2008 Purchase Plan. The 2008 Purchase Plan is
    generally similar to the 1999 Purchase Plan, except that under
    the 2008 Purchase Plan, any increases to the number of shares
    reserved for issuance must be approved by the Company’s
    stockholders. The first offering period of the 2008 Purchase
    Plan commenced on the first trading day after February 1,
    2009.

Employees purchased approximately 3.2 million,
    1.6 million, and 0.6 million shares of common stock
    through the 2008 Purchase Plan and 1999 Purchase Plan at an
    average exercise price of $12.16, $22.57, and $17.08 per share
    during fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009, approximately 1.6 million shares
    had been issued under the 2008 Purchase Plan, and
    10.4 million shares remained available for future issuance
    under the 2008 Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2008,
    approximately 8.1 million shares had been issued since
    inception, and 12.3 million shares remained available for
    future issuance under the 1999 Purchase Plan. Effective
    February 1, 2009, immediately following the conclusion of
    the offering period ended January 30, 2009, the 1999
    Purchase Plan was discontinued, and no shares remained available
    for future issuance under such plan.

Common
    Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had reserved an
    aggregate of approximately 104.8 million shares of common
    stock for future issuance under its stock awards plans and the
    2008 Purchase Plan.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Expense

The Company has elected to use the BSM option-pricing model,
    which incorporates various assumptions including volatility,
    risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield to
    calculate the fair value of stock option awards and common
    shares issues under the 1999 and 2008 Purchase Plans. The
    expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market
    traded options on the Company’s common stock, adjusted for
    other relevant factors including historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock over the most recent period
    commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
    Company’s stock options. The expected life of an award is
    based on historical

experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards
    granted to employees, as well as the potential effect from
    options that had not been exercised at the time.

In 2007, the government of India implemented a new fringe
    benefit tax that applies to equity awards granted to India
    taxpayers. This fringe benefit tax is payable by the issuer of
    the equity awards; however, the issuer is allowed to recover
    from individual award holders the fringe benefit taxes the
    issuer paid on their applicable equity awards. Beginning in
    January 2008, the Company amended its equity award agreements
    for future stock-based awards made to its employees in India to
    provide for the Company to be reimbursed for fringe benefit
    taxes paid in relation to applicable equity awards. The Company
    elected to use a BSM option-pricing model that incorporated a
    Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the fair value of
    stock-based awards issued under the amended equity award
    agreements. In August 2009, the government of India repealed the
    fringe benefit tax that applied to equity awards granted to
    India taxpayers. As of the effective date of the repeal, the
    Company discontinued the Monte Carlo simulation into its BSM
    option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based
    awards granted to its India employees subsequent to the repeal.

Extension
    of Stock Option Exercise Periods for Former Employees

The Company could not issue any securities under its
    registration statements on

Form S-8

during the period in which it was not current in its SEC
    reporting obligations to file periodic reports under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, during parts of
    2007, options vested and held by certain former employees of the
    Company could not be exercised until the completion of the
    Company’s stock option investigation and the Company’s
    public filings obligations had been met (the “trading
    black-out period”). The Company extended the expiration
    date of these stock options to April 7, 2007, the end of a

30-day

period subsequent to the Company’s filing of its required
    regulatory reports. As a result of the extensions, the fair
    values of such stock options had been reclassified to current
    liabilities subsequent to the modification and were subject to
    mark-to-market provisions at the end of each reporting period
    until the earlier of final settlement or April 7, 2007.
    Stock options covering approximately 660,000 shares of
    common stock were scheduled to expire and could not be exercised
    as a result of the trading black-out period restriction during
    the first quarter of 2007. The Company measured the fair value
    of these stock options using the BSM option valuation model and
    recorded an expense of approximately $4.3 million in the
    first quarter of 2007. In addition, the Company recorded an
    expense of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2007
    associated with the approximately 1,446,000 shares covered
    by such options which had exercise periods extended in 2006 as a
    result of the trading black-out period restriction. As of
    December 31, 2007, all of these extended stock options were
    either exercised or expired un-exercised. All previously
    recorded liabilities associated with such extensions were
    reclassified to additional paid-in capital by the second quarter
    of 2007.

Amendment
    of Certain Stock Options

In 2007, the Company completed a tender offer to amend certain
    options granted under the 1996 Plan and the 2000 Plan that had
    original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair
    market value per share of the common stock underlying the option
    on the option’s grant date, as determined by the Company
    for financial accounting purposes. Under this tender offer,
    employees subject to taxation in the United States and Canada
    had the opportunity to increase their strike price on affected
    options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the
    date of grant so as to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under
    United States Internal Revenue Code Section 409A
    (“409A issue”) or Canadian tax laws and regulations.
    In exchange for increasing the strike price of these options,
    the Company committed to make a cash payment to employees
    participating in the offer so as to make employees whole for the
    incremental strike price as compared to their original option
    exercise price. In connection with this offer, the Company
    amended options to purchase 4.3 million shares of its
    common stock and committed to make aggregate cash payments of
    $7.6 million to offer participants and recorded such amount
    as operating expense in 2007.

In addition, the Company entered into a separate agreement with
    two executives in 2007 to amend their unexercised stock options
    covering 0.1 million shares of the Company’s common
    stock in order to cure the 409A issue associated with such stock
    options. As a result, the Company committed to make aggregate
    cash payments of $0.4 million and recorded this payment
    liability as operating expense in 2007.

401(k)
    Plan

Juniper Networks maintains a savings and retirement plan
    qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
    of 1986, as amended. Employees meeting the eligibility
    requirement, as defined, may contribute up to the statutory
    limits of the year. The Company has matched employee
    contributions since January 1, 2001. The Company currently
    matches 25% of all eligible employee contributions. All matching
    contributions vest immediately. The Company’s matching
    contributions to the plan totaled $11.9 million,
    $10.7 million, and $9.5 million in 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan

In July 2008, the Company formed a non-qualified deferred
    compensation (“NQDC”) plan, which is an unfunded and
    unsecured deferred compensation arrangement. Under the NQDC
    plan, officers and other senior employees may elect to defer a
    portion of their compensation and contribute such amounts to one
    or more investment funds. The plan assets are included within
    investments and offsetting obligations are included within
    accrued compensation on the consolidated balance sheet. The
    investments are considered trading securities and are reported
    at fair value. The realized and unrealized holding gains and
    losses related to these investments are recorded in interest and
    other income, net, and the offsetting compensation expense are
    recorded operating expenses in the consolidated statements of
    operations. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, the deferred
    compensation liability under this plan was approximately
    $4.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.

Segment
    Information

The Company’s chief operating decision maker
    (“CODM”) allocates resources and assesses performance
    based on financial information by the Company’s business
    groups. The Company’s operations are organized into two
    reportable segments: Infrastructure and SLT. The Infrastructure
    segment includes products from the E-, M-, MX-, and T-series
    router product families, EX-series switching products, as well
    as the circuit-to-packet products. The SLT segment consists
    primarily of Firewall virtual private network
    (“Firewall”) systems and appliances, SRX services
    gateways, secure socket layer (“SSL”) virtual private
    network (“VPN”) appliances, intrusion detection and
    prevention (“IDP”) appliances, the J-series router
    product family and wide area network (“WAN”)
    optimization platforms.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The primary financial measure used by the CODM in assessing
    performance of the segments is segment operating income, which
    includes certain cost of revenues, R&D expenses, sales and
    marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses. The
    CODM does not allocate certain miscellaneous expenses to its
    segments even though such expenses are included in the
    Company’s management operating income.

For arrangements with both Infrastructure and SLT products and
    services, revenue is attributed to the segment based on the
    underlying purchase order, contract, or sell-through report.
    Direct costs and operating expenses, such as standard costs,
    research and development (“R&D”), and product
    marketing expenses, are generally applied to each segment.
    Indirect costs, such as manufacturing overhead and other cost of
    revenues, are allocated based on standard costs. Indirect
    operating expenses, such as sales, marketing, business
    development, and general and administrative expenses are
    generally allocated to each segment based on factors including
    headcount, usage, and revenue. The CODM does not allocate
    stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible
    assets, restructuring and impairment charges, gains or losses on
    equity investments, other net income and expense, income taxes,
    as well as certain other charges to the segments.

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, the Company had a
    valuation allowance on its U.S. domestic deferred tax
    assets of approximately $112.8 million and
    $41.5 million, respectively. The balance at
    December 31, 2009, consisted of approximately
    $70.7 million against certain California deferred assets
    and approximately $42.1 million relates to capital losses
    that will carry forward to offset future capital gains. The
    valuation allowance increased $71.3 million in the year
    ended December 31, 2009. The 2009 increase was primarily
    due to changes in California income tax law which impacted the
    future taxable income within California and the tax rates that
    will apply to taxable income for the years in which the deferred
    tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The valuation
    allowance increased $7.2 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2008, primarily due to investment losses
    currently disallowed for income tax purposes.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had federal and
    California net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $11.8 million and $21.2 million, respectively. The
    Company also had California tax credit carry-forwards of
    approximately $120.0 million. Approximately
    $12.5 million of the benefit from the California tax credit
    carry-forwards will be credited to additional paid-in capital
    when utilized on the Company’s income tax returns since
    they have not met the utilization criteria of ASC Topic 718.
    Unused net operating loss carry-forwards will expire at various
    dates beginning in the year 2012. The California tax credit
    carry-forwards will carry forward indefinitely.

The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are
    considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
    The Company has made no provision for U.S. income taxes on
    approximately $902.9 million of cumulative undistributed
    earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through
    December 31, 2009, because it is the Company’s
    intention to permanently reinvest such

earnings. If such earnings were distributed, the Company would
    accrue additional income taxes expense of approximately
    $274.5 million. These earnings are considered indefinitely
    invested in operations outside of the U.S., as we intend to
    utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of our
    international operations.

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, the total amount of
    gross unrecognized tax benefits was $183.6 million and
    $113.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009,
    approximately $118.6 million of the $183.6 million
    gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the
    effective tax rate.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the
    Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008 is as follows (in

As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, the Company had accrued
    interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $23.5 million and $8.7 million,
    respectively, within other long-term liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with the
    Company’s accounting policy, accrued interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a
    component of tax expense in the consolidated statements of
    operations. The Company recognized net interest and penalties
    expense of $14.8 million and $2.9 million in its
    consolidated statements of operations during the years ending
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

The Company engages in continuous discussion and negotiation
    with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various
    jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that the
    amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change
    within the next 12 months. However, an estimate of the
    range of possible change cannot be made at this time due to the
    high uncertainty of the resolution

and/or

closure on open audits. The Company does not expect complete
    resolution of any IRS audits or other audits within significant
    foreign or state jurisdictions within the next 12 months.

During 2009, the Company recorded unrecognized tax benefits
    related to share-based compensation due to a decision reached by
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“the
    Court”) in Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner. On
    January 13, 2010, the Court withdrew their decision in a
    one-line order. The Court indicated that it will be taking
    further actions on this case, but did not indicate what actions
    it intended to take or the timing of such actions. There are
    several possible actions that the Court may take including:
    (a) issue another order that affirms the lower Tax
    Court’s decision; (b) issue a new opinion that either
    affirms the Tax Court decision or reverses the Tax Court
    decision (e.g., based on different analysis); or (c) grant
    Xilinx’s petition for a rehearing en banc, or for a
    re-hearing by the same three-judge panel that issued the
    original Ninth Circuit Court ruling. At this time, the Company
    has no indication as to which of these options the Court will
    pursue. Given the holding articulated in the Court’s now
    withdrawn opinion, it is possible that the Court will pursue a
    course of action that will ultimately hold against Xilinx. As a
    result, the Company’s judgment has not changed with regard
    to this particular unrecognized tax benefit. Should the Court
    conclude on this matter within the next 12 months, it is
    reasonably possible that the Company’s unrecognized tax
    benefits will change by approximately $73 million.



Juniper

The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, Juniper
    Networks or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax
    returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state
    and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business the
    Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities
    throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as
    Ireland, Hong Kong, U.K., France, Germany, The Netherlands,
    Japan, China, Australia, India, and the U.S. With few
    exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to
    U.S. federal, state and local, and

non-U.S. income

tax examinations for years before 2004, although carry-forward
    attributes that were generated prior to 2004 may still be
    adjusted upon examination by the IRS if the attributes either
    have been or will be used in a future period.

The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the
    2004 through 2006 tax years. The Company is also subject to two
    separate ongoing examinations by the India tax authorities for
    the 2004 and 2004 through 2008 tax years, respectively, and has
    received an inquiry from the Hong Kong tax authorities for the
    2002 through 2006 tax years. Additionally, the Company has not
    reached a final resolution with the IRS on an adjustment it
    proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years. The Company is not
    aware of any other examination by taxing authorities in any
    other major jurisdictions in which it files income tax returns
    as of December 31, 2009.

In 2009, as part of the on-going 2004 IRS audit, the Company
    received a proposed adjustment related to the license of
    acquired intangibles under an intercompany R&D cost sharing
    arrangement. In March 2009, the Company received an assessment
    from the Hong Kong tax authorities specifically related to an
    inquiry of the 2002 tax year. In December 2008, the Company
    received a proposed adjustment from the India tax authorities
    related to the 2004 tax year.

In July 2009, the India tax authorities commenced a separate
    investigation of our 2004 through 2008 tax returns and are
    disputing the Company’s determination of taxable income due
    to the cost basis of certain fixed assets. The Company recorded
    $4.6 million in penalties and interest in 2009 relevant to
    this matter. The Company understands that the India tax
    authorities may issue an initial assessment that is
    substantially higher than this amount. As a result, in
    accordance with the administrative and judiciary process in
    India, the Company may be required to make payments that are
    substantially higher than the amount accrued in order to
    ultimately settle this issue. The Company strongly believes that
    any assessment it may receive in excess of the amount accrued
    would be inconsistent with applicable India tax laws and intends
    to defend this position vigorously.

The Company is pursuing all available administrative procedures
    relative to the matters referenced above. The Company believes
    that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable
    outcomes related to these proposed adjustments and the ultimate
    resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material
    effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of
    operations; however there is still a possibility that an adverse
    outcome of these matters could have a material effect on its
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For

Operating
    Leases

The Company leases its facilities under operating leases that
    expire at various times, the longest of which expires in
    November 2022. Future minimum payments under the non-cancelable
    operating leases, net of committed sublease income, totaled
    $303.3 million as of December 31, 2009. Rent expense
    for 2009, 2008, and 2007 was approximately $56.6 million,
    $58.0 million, and $48.7 million, respectively.

In October 2009, the Company amended three existing leases for
    the Company’s corporate headquarters facilities in
    Sunnyvale, California. Each lease was amended to:
    (i) extend the underlying lease term, and
    (ii) establish new monthly base rent payments for periods
    after November 1, 2009. The new monthly base rent payments
    represent a significant reduction in base rent that would have
    been payable for the previously remaining terms of each of the
    underlying leases.

Purchase
    Commitments

In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate
    component supply, contract manufacturers utilized by the Company
    place non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders
    for components based on the Company’s build forecasts. As
    of December 31, 2009, there were NCNR component orders
    placed by the contract manufacturers with a value of
    $139.5 million. The contract manufacturers use the
    components to build products based on the Company’s
    forecasts and on purchase orders that the Company has received
    from customers. Generally, the Company does not own the
    components and title to the products transfers from the contract
    manufacturers to the Company and immediately to the
    Company’s customers upon delivery at a designated shipment
    location. If the components remain unused or the products remain
    unsold for specified periods, the Company may incur carrying
    charges or obsolete materials charges for components that the
    contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet the
    Company’s forecast or customer orders. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had accrued
    $27.8 million based on its estimate of such charges.

Tax
    Liabilities

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
    $177.0 million included in current and long-term
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized
    tax positions. It is reasonably possible that the Company may
    reach agreement on certain issues and, as a result, the amount
    of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by
    approximately $1.5 million within the next 12 months.
    At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably
    reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to the
    additional $175.5 million in liability due to uncertainties
    in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

Other
    Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2009, other contractual obligations
    consists of an indemnity-related escrow amount of
    $1.3 million, a five-year $36.4 million data center
    hosting agreement, a three-year $22.7 million software
    subscription, and a joint development agreement with a
    third-party for development of network-related technology, which
    requires quarterly payments of $3.5 million through January
    2010. The Company records the quarterly payment to the
    third-party developer as R&D expense in its consolidated
    statements of operations until the technology under development
    has reached technological feasibility. Pursuant to the joint
    development agreement, in exchange for each party’s
    respective contributions to the development effort as well as
    the consideration payable by the Company, each party will obtain
    a license to the technology that result from the development for
    use in certain of their respective product lines. As of
    December 31, 2009, $19.1 million remained unpaid under
    the data center hosting agreement with the remaining commitment
    expected to be paid through the end of April 2013, and
    $15.4 million remained unpaid under the software
    subscription agreement with the remaining commitment expected to
    be paid through the end of January 2011, and $3.5 million
    remained under the joint development agreement.

The Company enters into agreements with customers that contain
    indemnification provisions relating to potential situations
    where claims could be alleged that the Company’s products
    infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party.
    Other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include
    guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees
    related to third-party customer financing arrangements, and
    standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had $34.0 million in
    guarantees and standby letters of credit and recorded a
    liability of $21.9 million related to a third-party
    customer-financing guarantee. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company had not recorded a liability related to its guarantees
    and indemnification arrangements.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in
    the ordinary course of business, such as employment or
    intellectual property claims, including the matters described
    below. The outcome of any such matters is currently not
    determinable. Although the Company does not expect that any such
    legal claims or litigation will ultimately have a material
    adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or
    results of operations, an adverse result in one or more of such
    matters could negatively affect the Company’s consolidated
    financial results in the period in which they occur.

Federal
    Securities Class Action

On July 14, 2006, and August 29, 2006, two purported
    class actions were filed in the Northern District of California
    against the Company and certain of the Company’s current
    and former officers and directors. On November 20, 2006,
    the Court consolidated the two actions as

In re Juniper
    Networks, Inc. Securities Litigation,

No. C06-04327-JW,

and appointed the New York City Pension Funds as lead
    plaintiffs. The lead plaintiffs filed a Consolidated
    Class Action Complaint on January 12, 2007, and filed
    an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint on
    April 9, 2007. The Amended Consolidated Complaint alleges
    that the defendants violated federal securities laws by
    manipulating stock option grant dates to coincide with low stock
    prices and issuing false and misleading statements including,
    among others, incorrect financial statements due to the improper
    accounting of stock option grants. The Amended Consolidated
    Complaint asserts claims for violations of the Securities Act of
    1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of all
    persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Juniper
    Networks’ publicly-traded securities from July 12,
    2001, through and including August 10, 2006. Plaintiffs
    seek unspecified damages in an unspecified amount. On
    June 7, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss
    certain of the claims, and a hearing was held on
    September 10, 2007. On March 31, 2008, the Court
    issued an order granting in



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

part and denying in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss.
    The order dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs’
    section 10(b) claim to the extent it was based on
    challenged statements made before July 14, 2001. The order
    also dismissed, with leave to amend, plaintiffs’
    section 10(b) claim against Pradeep Sindhu. The order
    upheld all of plaintiffs’ remaining claims. Plaintiffs did
    not amend their complaint.

On September 25, 2009, the Court certified a plaintiff
    class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or
    otherwise acquired the Company’s securities from
    July 11, 2003 to August 10, 2006 inclusive, and were
    damaged thereby, including those who received or acquired
    Juniper Networks’ common stock issued pursuant to the
    registration statement on SEC

Form S-4,

dated March 10, 2004, for the Company’s merger with
    NetScreen Technologies Inc.; and purchasers of Zero Coupon
    Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 issued pursuant
    to a registration statement on SEC

Form S-3

dated November 20, 2003. Excluded from the Class are the
    Defendants and the current and former officers and directors of
    the Company, their immediate families, their heirs, successors,
    or assigns and any entity controlled by any such person.

On February 5, 2010, the Company and the lead plaintiffs
    entered into an agreement in principle to settle the claims
    against the Company and each of the Company’s current and
    former officers and directors. The settlement is contingent upon
    approval by the Boards of Trustees of the lead plaintiffs and
    approval by the Court. Under the proposed settlement, the claims
    against the Company and its officers and directors will be
    dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a
    $169.0 million cash payment by the Company. The Company
    considers the proposed payment to be probable and reasonably
    estimable and, therefore, recorded the cash settlement amount as
    a pre-tax operating expense in its consolidated statement of
    operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009.

Calamore
    Proxy Statement Action

On March 28, 2007, an action titled

Jeanne M.
    Calamore v. Juniper Networks, Inc., et al.,

No. C-07-1772-JW,

was filed by Jeanne M. Calamore in the Northern District of
    California against the Company and certain of the Company’s
    current and former officers and directors. The complaint alleges
    that the proxy statement for the Company’s 2006 Annual
    Meeting of Stockholders contained various false and misleading
    statements in that it failed to disclose stock option backdating
    information. As a result, the plaintiff seeks preliminary and
    permanent injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s
    2006 Equity Incentive Plan, including seeking to invalidate the
    plan and all equity awards granted and grantable thereunder. On
    May 21, 2007, the Company filed a motion to dismiss, and
    the plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction. On
    July 19, 2007, the Court issued an order denying the
    plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction and
    dismissing the complaint in its entirety with leave to amend.
    The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on August 27,
    2007, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on
    October 9, 2007. On August 13, 2008, the Court issued
    an order granting the Company’s motion to dismiss with
    prejudice, and entered final judgment in favor of the Company.
    On September 9, 2008, the plaintiff filed a Notice of
    Appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
    Circuit. The plaintiff’s appeal was fully briefed and the
    Court of Appeals heard oral argument on the appeal on
    October 7, 2009. On February 5, 2010, the Ninth
    Circuit issued a memorandum decision affirming the District
    Court’s dismissal with prejudice. On February 19, 2010,
    plaintiff filed a Petition for Rehearing  and Suggestion for
    Rehearing

IPO
    Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First
    Boston Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal
    Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG Cowen Securities
    Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase
    (Hambrecht & Quist LLC), J.P. Morgan
    Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith
    Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
    Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”),
    Juniper Networks and certain of Juniper Networks’ officers.
    This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the
    Company’s common stock in its initial public offering in
    June 1999 and the Company’s secondary offering in September
    1999.



Juniper
    Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that
    the prospectus pursuant to which shares of common stock were
    sold in the Company’s initial public offering and the
    Company’s subsequent secondary offering contained certain
    false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the
    practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation
    of shares of common stock in these offerings and their receipt
    of commissions from customers related to such allocations.
    Various plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar
    allegations concerning the initial public offerings of
    approximately 300 other issuers. These various cases pending in
    the Southern District of New York have been coordinated for
    pretrial proceedings as

In re Initial Public Offering
    Securities Litigation

, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, the
    plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the action
    against the Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act
    of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The defendants
    in the coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In
    October 2002, the Company’s officers were dismissed from
    the case without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation. On
    February 19, 2003, the Court granted in part and denied in
    part the motion to dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims
    against the Company.

In June 2004, a stipulation of settlement and release of claims
    against the issuer defendants, including the Company, was
    submitted to the Court for approval. On August 31, 2005,
    the Court preliminarily approved the settlement. In December
    2006, the Appellate Court overturned the certification of
    classes in the six test cases that were selected by the
    underwriter defendants and plaintiffs in the coordinated
    proceedings (the action involving the Company is not one of the
    six test cases). Because class certification was a condition of
    the settlement, it was unlikely that the settlement would
    receive final Court approval. On June 25, 2007, the Court
    entered an order terminating the proposed settlement based upon
    a stipulation among the parties to the settlement. The
    plaintiffs have filed amended master allegations and amended
    complaints in the six focus cases. On March 26, 2008, the
    Court largely denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the
    amended complaints in the six test cases.

The parties have reached a global settlement of the litigation.
    On October 5, 2009, the Court entered an Opinion and Order
    granting final approval of the settlement. Under the settlement,
    the insurers are to pay the full amount of settlement share
    allocated to the Company, and the Company will bear no financial
    liability. The Company, as well as the officer and director
    defendants who were previously dismissed from the action
    pursuant to tolling agreements, will receive complete dismissals
    from the case. Certain objectors have appealed the Court’s
    October 5, 2009, final order to the Second Circuit Court of
    Appeals.

16(b)
    Demand

On October 3, 2007, a purported Juniper Networks
    shareholder filed a complaint for violation of
    Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which
    prohibits short-swing trading, against the Company’s IPO
    underwriters. The complaint, Vanessa Simmonds v. The
    Goldman Sachs Group, et al., Case

No. C07-015777,

in District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeks
    the recovery of short-swing profits. The Company is named as a
    nominal defendant. No recovery is sought from the Company in
    this matter.

Menlo
    Equities

In December 2008, Menlo Equities Development Company II, LLC
    (“Menlo Equities”) initiated in an arbitration
    proceeding against the Company. Menlo Equities and the Company
    are members of Menlo/Juniper Networks LLC and are parties to an
    Operating Agreement and a Development Services Agreement
    relating to certain real estate in Sunnyvale, California
    purchased in 2000. The dispute related to whether the Company
    would be obligated to pay Menlo Equities certain fees under the
    agreements, if and when the real estate is developed or sold.
    Menlo Equities asserted that it is entitled to immediate payment
    of damages of approximately $29.0 million plus
    attorney’s fees as a result of a repudiation and breach of
    the agreements. The Company denied Menlo Equities’
    allegations. An arbitration hearing was conducted in June 2009,
    and the arbitrator issued an interim decision in September that
    ruled in Menlo’s favor in most areas. On December 28,
    2009, the parties resolved the dispute through an amendment of
    the underlying agreements whereby the Company acquired Menlo
    Equities’ interest in the LLC pursuant to the amended buy
    out provisions of the Operating Agreement for
    $13.0 million, which the

Company recorded as litigation settlement charges within
    operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, and each party was
    relieved of all obligations under the Development Services
    Agreement. In addition, the Company was released from all claims
    and the parties agreed to terminate the arbitration.

IRS
    Notices of Proposed Adjustments

In 2007, the IRS opened an examination of the Company’s
    U.S. federal income tax and employment tax returns for the
    2004 fiscal year. Subsequently, the IRS extended their
    examination of the Company’s employment tax returns to
    include fiscal years 2005 and 2006. As of December 31,
    2009, the IRS has not yet concluded its examinations of these
    returns. In September 2008, as part of its ongoing audit of the
    U.S. federal income tax return, the IRS issued a Notice of
    Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) regarding the
    Company’s business credits. The Company believes that it
    has adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome
    related to this proposed adjustment.

In July 2009, the Company received a NOPA from the IRS claiming
    that the Company owes additional taxes, plus interest and
    possible penalties, for the 2004 tax year based on a transfer
    pricing transaction related to the license of acquired
    intangibles under an intercompany R&D cost sharing
    arrangement. The asserted changes to the Company’s 2004 tax
    year would affect the Company’s income tax liabilities in
    tax years subsequent to 2003. Because of the NOPA, the estimated
    incremental tax liability would be approximately
    $807.0 million, excluding interest and penalties. The
    Company has filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the
    IRS, which will cause the matter to be referred to the Appeals
    Division of the IRS. The Company strongly believes the IRS’
    position with regard to this matter is inconsistent with
    applicable tax laws and existing Treasury regulations, and that
    its previously reported income tax provision for the year in
    question is appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that
    this matter will be resolved in the Company’s favor.
    Regardless of whether this matter is resolved in the
    Company’s favor, the final resolution of this matter could
    be expensive and time-consuming to defend

and/or

settle. While the Company believes it has provided adequately
    for this matter, there is still a possibility that an adverse
    outcome of the matter could have a material effect on its
    results of operations and financial condition.

The Company has not reached a final resolution with the IRS on
    an adjustment the IRS proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years.
    The Company is also under routine examination by certain state
    and

non-U.S. tax

authorities. The Company believes that it has adequately
    provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these
    audits.

Joint
    Venture

In 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to form a joint
    venture to provide a combined carrier Ethernet-based solution
    with NSN. At inception, the Company contributed
    $6.6 million for a 60 percent interest in the joint
    venture. Both NSN and Juniper Networks are entitled to appoint
    two board members to the Board of the joint venture. The Board
    shall consist of four board members at all times.

Given the Company’s majority ownership interest in the
    joint venture, the venture’s financial results have been
    consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a
    noncontrolling interest has been recorded to reflect the
    noncontrolling investor’s interest in the venture’s
    results. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated,
    with the exception of the noncontrolling interest.

Stock
    Repurchases

Subsequent to December 31, 2009, through the filing of this
    report, the Company repurchased 2.1 million shares of its
    common stock, for $55.3 million at an average purchase
    price of $26.28 per share, under its 2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program. As of the filing of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the Company’s 2008 Stock Repurchase Programs had remaining
    authorized funds of $263.3 million. Purchases under this
    program are subject to a review of the circumstances in place at
    the time. Acquisitions under the Company’s share repurchase
    program may be made from time to time as permitted by securities
    laws and other legal requirements. This program may be
    discontinued at any time.

In February 2010, the Company’s Board approved a new stock
    repurchase program which authorized the Company to repurchase up
    to $1.0 billion of its common stock. This new authorization
    is in addition to the Company’s 2008 Stock Repurchase
    Program. Share repurchases under the Company’s stock
    repurchase programs will be subject to a review of the
    circumstances in place at the time and will be made from time to
    time in private transactions or open market purchases as

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Attached as exhibits to this report are certifications of our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
    which are required in accordance with

Rule 13a-14

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”). This “Controls and
    Procedures” section includes information concerning the
    controls and related evaluations referred to in the
    certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the
    certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics
    presented.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures, as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer
    concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this
    report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
    reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
    periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules
    and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

In 2007, we initiated a multi-year implementation to upgrade
    certain key internal systems and processes, including our
    company-wide human resources management system, customer
    relationship management (“CRM”) system, and our
    enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This
    project is the result of our normal business process to evaluate
    and upgrade or replace our systems software and related business
    processes to support our evolving operational needs. There were
    no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
    occurred during the fourth quarter of 2009 that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),
    does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal
    control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
    error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives
    will be met. Our controls and procedures are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that our control system’s objective
    will be met and our CEO and CFO have concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level. The design of a control system must
    reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
    benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
    Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
    systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not
    occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
    within the Company have been detected. These inherent
    limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
    circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
    part on certain assumptions



about the likelihood of future events. Projections of any
    evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are
    subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree
    of compliance with policies or procedures.
