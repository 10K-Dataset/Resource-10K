Overview

We design and sell products and services that together provide our
customers with Internet Protocol (IP) network infrastructure solutions. Our
solutions are incorporated into the global web of interconnected public and
private networks across which a variety of media, including voice, video and
data, travel to and from end users around the world. Our network
infrastructure solutions enable service providers and other network-intensive
businesses to support and deliver services and applications on a highly
efficient and low cost integrated network. As a result, our customers, which
include service providers, government
organizations, cable operators, mobile operators, research and education
institutions and network-intensive businesses, are able to convert networks that provide commoditized, best
efforts services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation and
value and increased reliability and security to end users, both corporate and
residential.

At the close of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, we had generated
annual revenues of $701.4 million. We employed 1,553 employees as of December
31, 2003 and have conducted business in approximately 70 countries.

We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware
in 1997. Our corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California. Our
website address is www.juniper.net.

The Juniper Networks Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to transform the business of networking by
converting bandwidth, which is a commodity, into a dependable, secure and
highly valuable corporate asset. Our technological leadership and problem
solving abilities combined with our experience and fundamental understanding of
the requirements of high performance IP network infrastructure will help us in
meeting our objectives. Key elements of our strategy are described below.

Maintain and Extend Technology Leadership

. Our application-specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) technology, software and network-optimized product
architecture have been key elements to establishing our technology leadership.
We believe that these elements can be leveraged into future products we are
currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our technological
leadership in the network infrastructure market through continued investment to
enhance the feature richness of our products and to develop future
differentiated offerings for our customers.

Leverage Early Lead as Supplier of Purpose-Built Network Infrastructure

.
From inception we have focused on designing and building IP network
infrastructure for service providers and network intensive businesses and have
integrated purpose-built technology into a network optimized architecture that
specifically meets our customers’ needs. We believe that many of these
customers will deploy network infrastructure equipment from only a few vendors.
The purpose-built advantages of our products provide us with a time-to-market
lead, which is a critical advantage in gaining rapid penetration as one of
these selected vendors. Once our products have been widely deployed in a
customer’s network, we create a significant barrier to entry to potential
competitors who do not currently offer commercially-viable next generation
routing solutions.

Be Strategic to Our Customers

. In developing our solutions, we work very
closely with customers to design and build a product specifically to meet their
complex needs. Over time, we have expanded our understanding of the challenges
facing these customers. That increased understanding has enabled us to
subsequently design additional capabilities into our products. We believe our

close relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers have been
key elements in our design wins and rapid deployment to date. We plan to
continue to work very closely with our customers to implement enhancements to
current products as well as to design future products that specifically meet
their evolving needs.



Enable New IP-Based Services

. Our platform enables network operators to
build networks cost effectively and to offer new differentiated services for
their customers more efficiently than conventional products. We believe that
the delivery of IP-based services and applications, including web hosting,
outsourced Internet and intranet services, outsourced enterprise applications
and voice-over IP, will continue to grow and are cost-effectively enabled by
our network infrastructure solutions.

Establish
and Develop Industry Partnerships

. Our customers have diverse
requirements, some of which our products satisfy. Our products are
not intended to satisfy certain other requirements. Therefore we
believe that it is important to build relationships with other industry leaders
in a diverse set of networking technologies in order to fully support
our customers’ requirements.

Markets and Customers

Our customers include network operators in and value added resellers that
sell into the following markets:

Research and education (R&E) networks push the envelope in networking and
applications, continually demanding the most advanced products and technologies
while simultaneously helping shape their development. These networks help
academic researchers and educators transform their vision into reality with
scientific and educational advancements using applications such as
telemedicine, 3D visualization and simulation, grid computing, and
collaborative videoconferencing. Our products are deployed in R&E institutions
and networks worldwide and further those institutions goals by providing:

•

High performance, reliable platforms for leading-edge scientific
and educational applications; and

•

Advanced capabilities including IPv6, multicast, and packet
filtering while maintaining high performance.

Network-Intensive Businesses

Our solutions are designed to meet the reliability and scalability
demanded by the world’s largest and most advanced networks. For this reason,
information intensive enterprises that rely on their networks for the essence
of their business are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in
delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge
applications while:

•

Reducing costs through operational efficiencies in implementing and
managing the network;

•

Driving down capital expenses with sophisticated network
intelligence that is robust, secure and scalable; and

•

Providing enterprises with the control necessary to deliver an
assured user experience to their customers and internal clients.

Fundamental Requirements for High Performance, Low Cost Integrated
Networks

As they work to support dramatic growth in IP traffic and seek to offer
new revenue generating or mission-critical services, service
providers, government organizations, cable operators, mobile operators and
network-intensive businesses require network



infrastructure equipment that is not only feature rich but also delivers
high reliability and performance. Feature richness, high reliability, high
performance, security, scalability, interoperability, and cost effectiveness
are each fundamental requirements in meeting the needs associated with the
growth in IP traffic and the efficient delivery of value-added services to end
users.

Feature Richness.

The importance of increasing revenue streams and
decreasing capital and operational costs for our customers is a significant
priority in the industry. Customers want to sell more revenue generating
services with better cost efficiencies, which is ultimately a function of the
features and capabilities that can be provided on each of the network elements.
Most of the feature richness evolves in software and as the networks advance,
more and more features are required to sell new services as well as to lower
the ongoing costs of operating the network. Next generation routers therefore
need to have flexibility to add new capabilities frequently without
compromising
the performance of the system, which gets increasingly difficult as the network
demands increase.

High Reliability

. As businesses and consumers increasingly rely on IP
networks for mission-critical applications, high network reliability is
essential. As a result, those businesses and consumers expect service
providers to deliver a high degree of reliability in their networks.

High Performance Without Compromising Intelligence

. To handle the rapid
growth in IP traffic, today’s network operators increasingly require network
infrastructure that can operate at higher speeds, while still delivering
real-time services such as security and quality-of-service features. The
processing of data packets at these high speeds requires sophisticated
forwarding technology to inspect each packet and assign it to a destination
based on priority, data type and other considerations. Since a large number of
IP packets, many of which perform critical administrative functions, are small
in size, high performance IP routers need to achieve their specified
transmission speeds even for small packet sizes. Since smaller packets
increase packet processing demands, routing large numbers of smaller packets
tends to be more resource intensive than routing of larger packets. A wire
speed router, which achieves its specified transmission rate for any type of
traffic passing through it, can accomplish this task. Thus, provisioning of
mission-critical services increasingly requires the high performance enabled by
wire speed processing.

High Performance Under Stressful Conditions

. In a large and complex
network, individual components inevitably fail. However, the failure of an
individual device or link must not compromise the network as a whole. In a
typical network, when a failure occurs, the network loses some degree of
capacity and, in turn, a greater load falls on the remaining network routers,
which must provide alternate routes. IP infrastructure must quickly adjust to
the new state of the network to maintain packet forwarding rates and avoid
dropping significant numbers of packets when active routes are lost or when
large numbers of routes change. Routing protocols are used to accomplish this
convergence, a process that places even greater stress on the router. Given
the complexity of IP network infrastructure, the convergence process is far
more complex and places a far greater load on the routing software, thereby
requiring a much more sophisticated device.

Security

. There are more and more issues everyday regarding network
security ranging from simple denial of service attacks to sophisticated,
pervasive and malicious intrusions. The challenge of security is increasing in
awareness within all of our customers and we are continually improving and
evolving the security capabilities on product solutions. It is extremely
important to provide comprehensive network-based security services that are
fully integrated, free of performance trade-offs and scaled to any customer or
market.

Scalability

. Due to the rapid growth in IP traffic, service providers must
continuously expand their networks, both in terms of increased numbers of
access points of presence (PoPs), and also greater capacity per PoP. To
facilitate this expansion process, network infrastructure equipment must be
highly scalable. Next generation routers therefore need to be flexible and
configurable to function within constantly changing networks while incurring
minimal downtime.

Interoperability

. In order to gain acceptance in IP networks, new products
must be compatible with the existing network environment. Given the open and
inter-connected nature of the public network infrastructure, service
providers,
government organizations, cable operators, mobile operators and network-intensive businesses must control and police traffic on their



networks. As a result, the operating system in each router must offer
100% compatibility with the interior protocols and standards used within each
network. The compatibility level must be maintained despite changes to
equipment configuration and network architecture and upgrades to the various
protocol standards. Thus, the operating system must be flexible to support any
necessary revisions. This level of compatibility, in turn, cannot impact the
performance, scalability or reliability of the equipment. Attaining this
sophisticated level of interoperability is highly challenging and requires
significant testing to ensure compatibility.

High Return on Investment in Network Infrastructure

. Continued growth in
IP traffic, price competition in the telecommunications market and increasing
pressure for network operators to attain higher returns on their network
infrastructure investments all contribute to our customers’ desire for solutions that
significantly reduce the capital expenditures required to build and operate
their networks. In addition to the basic cost of equipment, network operators
incur substantial ancillary costs for the space required to deploy the
equipment, power consumed and ongoing operation and maintenance of the
equipment. Network operators therefore want to deploy dense and varied
equipment configurations in limited amounts of rack and floor space.
Therefore, in order to continue to scale their networks toward higher data
speeds in a cost effective manner, network operators need the ability to mix
and match easily many different speed connections at appropriate densities,
without significantly increasing the consumption of space or power and driving
costs higher.

These requirements define a clear need for IP infrastructure solutions
that can support high speeds and offer new IP-based services. At the same
time, network operators are eagerly seeking new solutions that increase the
level of scalability and reliability within their networks and reduce the cost
of their architectures.

Juniper Networks Technology and Products

Early in the Company’s history, we developed, marketed and sold the first
commercially available purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the
specific high performance needs of service providers. As the need for core
bandwidth continued to increase, the need for service rich platforms at the
edge of the network was created. Our products are designed to address the
needs at the core and the edge of the network as well as for wireless and cable
access by combining high-performance packet forwarding technology and rich
software into a network-optimized solution.

Today, as then, our technology is built upon our router architecture,
ASIC and software expertise. Our products offer a full suite of
scalable, tested routing protocols, which are used to control and direct
network traffic, and are critical to a network routing solution. This control
is made more important by the fact that the size and complexity of IP networks
are increasing at a time when service providers are looking to differentiate
themselves through value-added service offerings.

General Product Architecture

We believe that an overview of the physical nature of our products is
helpful in understanding the operation of our business.

Although specific designs vary among our product families, our platforms
are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform.
The chassis contains components that enable and support many of the fundamental
functions of the router, such as power supplies, cooling fans, and components
that run our JUNOS or JUNOSe operating system, perform high-speed packet
forwarding, or keep track of the structure of the network and instruct the
packet forwarding components where to send packets. Each chassis has a certain
number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to
as modules or interfaces.

The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming
packets of data from the network over a variety of transmission media. The
physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to
as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the
functionality and throughput offered by the module. In some cases, modules do
not contain ports



or physically receive packets from the network, but rather enhance the
overall functionality of the router. We refer to these components as service
modules.

Product Families

M-Series and T-Series:

Our M-series platforms are extremely versatile as
they can be deployed at the edge of operator networks, in small and medium core
networks, and in other applications. The M-series product family includes the
M5, M7i, M10, M10i, M20, M40e, M160 and M320 platforms. Our T-series platforms, T320
and T640, are primarily designed for core IP infrastructures. The M-series and T-series products leverage our
ASIC technology and the same JUNOS operating system to ensure continuous and predictable
service delivery, while reducing capital and operational costs.

E-Series:

Our E-series products are a full featured platform with support
for carrier-class routing, broadband subscriber management services and a
comprehensive set of IP services. The E-series family includes the ERX-310,
ERX-705, ERX-710, ERX-1410, and ERX-1440 platforms. Leveraging our JUNOSe
operating system, the E-Series service delivery architecture enables service
providers to easily deploy innovative revenue generating services to their
customers and avoid the costly and limiting piecemeal outcomes that result from
equipment that delivers inconsistent edge services. All E-Series platforms
offer a full suite of routing protocols and provide scalable capacity for tens
of thousands of users.

J-20:

Our J-20 product, developed together with Ericsson A.B., provides a
scalable solution for wireless networks and supports wireless operators in
their evolution from voice-centric networks to the new multimedia-rich
networks.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution Structure

As of December 31, 2003, the Company employed a staff of 434 employees in
our worldwide sales and marketing organizations. These sales employees operate
within their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly
or manage customer opportunities through our strategic distribution
relationships and value-added resellers. Information concerning our revenues
by significant customers and by geographic region can be found in Note 2 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Direct Sales Structure

Our direct sales organization is organized according to theater and within
each theater according to the particular needs in that market. For example,
currently the Americas sales theater is organized into three geographic areas
and two vertical markets. In addition, within the US geographic areas, the
major incumbent carriers are assigned dedicated account teams that operate
separately from the territory teams. The Asia-Pacific sales theater is
organized into four geographic areas, while the EMEA sales theater is organized
into six major account teams, and geographic teams covering all activity
outside of the major accounts.

Our direct relationships with our customers are generally governed either
by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgement of those orders or by
purchase contracts. In instances where we have contracts with our customer,
those contracts set forth only general terms of sale and do not require
customers to purchase specified quantities of our products.

Global Channel System

In our sales and marketing efforts, we also employ a global network of
strategic distribution relationships as well as theater or country-specific
value added resellers. Within each theater, in addition to our direct sales
force, we employ sales professionals to assist with the management of our
various channel partners.



We have strategic distribution relationships with Ericsson A.B., Lucent
Technologies and Siemens A.G. We believe that each of these companies have
significant customer relationships in place and offer products that complement
our product offerings. Our arrangements with each of these partners allow them
to distribute our products on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for
discounts based upon the volume of products sold and specify other general
terms of sale. The agreements do not require these partners to purchase
specified quantities of our products. Each of Ericsson and Siemens accounted
for greater than 10% of our total revenues in 2003.

In addition to these strategic distribution relationships, the Company
maintains relationships with value-added resellers in various theaters. These
resellers tend to be focused on particular theaters or particular countries
within theaters. These resellers have expertise in deploying complex network
infrastructure in their respective markets. Our agreements with these
resellers are non-exclusive, generally limited by theater, and provide
volume-based discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do
not require resellers to purchase specified quantities of our products.

Customer Service and Support

We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the
successful deployment and ongoing support of our products and we have hired
support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services. In
most cases, our customer service and support organization provides front line
product support and is the problem resolution interface to our partners and
direct end users. We offer the following services: 24x7x365 technical
assistance, hardware repair and replacement, professional services and
educational services. We deliver these services directly to major end users
and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of
our partners and third party organizations. We also train our partners in the
delivery of education and support services.

As of December 31, 2003, we employed 190 people in our worldwide customer
service and support organization.

Research and Development

We have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in
the fields of high-end computing, network system design, routing protocols and
embedded software. These individuals have been drawn from leading computer
data networking and telecommunications companies. In addition to building
complex hardware and software systems, the engineering team has experience in
delivering highly integrated ASICs and scalable technology.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to
our strategy of enhancing our core technology, developing additional
applications, incorporating that technology and maintaining the competitiveness
of our product and service offerings. We are leveraging our ASIC technology,
developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customer applications
and continuing to develop next generation technology to support the anticipated
growth in IP network requirements. We continue to expand the functionality of
our products to improve performance and scalability, and to provide an enhanced
user interface.

Our research and development process is driven by the availability of new
technology, market demand and customer feedback. We have invested significant
time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development
projects. This process involves all functional groups and all levels within
the Company. Following an assessment of market demand, our research and
development team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product
specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales
organizations. This process is designed to provide a framework for defining
and addressing the steps, tasks and activities required to bring product
concepts and development projects to market.

As of December 31, 2003, we employed 669 people in our worldwide research
and development organization.



Our research and development expenses totaled $176.1 million, $161.9
million and $155.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operation is outsourced. We currently have
manufacturing relationships with Celestica and Plexus, under which we have
subcontracted our manufacturing activity. This subcontracting activity extends
from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material
procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers and
repairs. We design, specify and monitor all of the tests that are required to
meet internal and external quality standards. These arrangements provide us
with the following benefits:

Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on rolling
forecasts from us about our product needs. Each of the contract manufacturers
procure components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and test
the products according to our specifications. Products are then shipped
directly to our customers. The Company is not the owner of any of the
components and our customers generally take title to our products upon shipment
from the contract manufacturers. In certain circumstances, we may be liable to
our contract manufacturers for carrying and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased
based on our forecasts.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, those
contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract
manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The contracts do not
require them to accept purchase orders from us or to manufacture our
products, on a long-term basis.

Our ASICs are manufactured by IBM who is responsible for all aspects of
the production of the ASICs using our proprietary designs.

Competition

Competition in the network infrastructure market is intense. Cisco
Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) has historically dominated the market, with other
companies such as Nortel Networks and Alcatel S.A. providing products to a
smaller segment of the market. In addition, a number of public and private
companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that
our products address.

Cisco traditionally has been the dominant supplier of solutions to our
markets. We believe this is the result of its early leadership position in the
enterprise router market. As both large public and private networks and
traffic over the Internet has grown rapidly, Cisco has leveraged this position
and has developed a broad product line of routers that support all major local
area and wide area interfaces. We believe that our ability to compete with
Cisco depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in
meeting the needs of our current and potential customers and are extremely
compatible with Cisco’s current and future products. Although we believe that
we are currently among the top providers of IP infrastructure solutions
worldwide, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
with Cisco, currently the leading provider in this market.



We expect that, over time, large companies with significant resources,
technical expertise, market experience, customer relationships and broad
product lines, such as Nortel and Alcatel, will introduce new products which
are designed to compete more effectively in this market. As a result, we
expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with
significantly more resources than we have. Although we believe that our
technology and the purpose-built features of our products make them unique and
will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we cannot assure
you that we will be successful.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Nortel and
Alcatel, have significantly broader product lines than we do and may bundle
their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage
customers from purchasing our products. Also, many of our current and
potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer
bases that could be leveraged. Increased competition could result in price
reduction, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market
share, any of which could seriously harm our operating results.

There are also many small public and private companies that claim to have
products with greater capabilities than our products. Consolidation in this
industry has begun, with one or more of these smaller private companies being
acquired by large, established suppliers of network infrastructure products,
and we believe it is likely to continue. As a result, we expect to face
increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly
more resources than we have.

Several companies also provide solutions that can substitute for some uses
of routers. For example, high bandwidth Asynchronous Transfer Mode (“ATM”)
switches are used in the core of certain major backbone service providers. ATM
switches can carry a variety of traffic types, including voice, video and data,
using fixed, 53 byte cells. Companies that use ATM switches are enhancing
their products with new software technologies such as Multi-Protocol Label
Switching (“MPLS”), which can potentially simplify the task of mixing routers
and switches in the same network. These substitutes can reduce the need for
large numbers of routers.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our
internally developed technology and know-how. Our engineering teams have
significant expertise in ASIC design and we own all rights to the design of the
ASICs, which form the core of many of our products. Our software was developed
internally and is protected by United States and other copyright
laws. We currently have 30 issued U.S. patents expiring
between 2016 and 2021.

While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law to
protect our technology, we also believe that factors such as the technological
and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent
product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to
establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no
assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or
superior to our technology.

Our success will depend upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual
property rights and protect our intellectual property rights. While we have
filed patent applications, we cannot be certain that these applications will
issue into patents, that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual
property rights or that other parties will not contest our intellectual
property rights.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we had 1,553 full-time employees, 260 of whom
were in finance, administration, IT and operations. None of our employees are
represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and
we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued
service of our key technical, sales and senior management personnel, none of
whom is bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined
period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our



future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, train
and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel.
Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that
we can retain our key personnel in the future.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the
ordinary course of business, including the matters described below. The
outcome of these matters is currently not determinable. However, the Company
does not expect that such legal claims and litigation will ultimately have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson
Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG Cowen
Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase
(Hambrecht & Quist LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc.,
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated
(collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Company and certain of the Company’s
officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s
common stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999 and its
secondary offering in September 1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the
prospectus pursuant to which shares of common stock were sold in the Company’s
initial public offering and its subsequent secondary offering contained certain
false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the practices of the



Underwriters with respect to their allocation of shares of common stock in
these offerings and their receipt of commissions from customers related to such
allocations. Various plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar
allegations concerning the initial public offerings of approximately 300 other
issuers. These various cases pending in the Southern District of New York have
been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as In re Initial Public Offering
Securities Litigation, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated
amended complaint in the action against the Company, alleging violations of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in
the coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October 2002, the
Company’s officers were dismissed from the case without prejudice pursuant to a
stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the Court granted in part and denied in part
the motion to dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims against the Company.
A proposal has been made for the settlement and release of claims against the
issuer defendants, including the Company. The settlement is subject to a number
of conditions, including approval of the proposed settling parties and the
court. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation against the Company
continues, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to
defend the case vigorously.

Federal Securities Class Action Suit

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, a number of essentially identical
shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain
of its officers and former officers purportedly on behalf of those stockholders
who purchased the Company’s publicly traded securities between April 12, 2001
and June 7, 2001. In April 2002, the judge granted the defendants’ motion to
consolidate all of these actions into one; in May 2002, the court appointed
the lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of lead counsel and an amended
complaint was filed in July 2002. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants
made false and misleading statements, assert claims for violations of the
federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief. In September 2002, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended
complaint. In March 2003, the judge granted defendants motion to dismiss with
leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint in April 2003 and
the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in May 2003. The hearing
on defendants’ motion to dismiss was held on September 12, 2003. The judge has
not yet ruled on the motion. There has been no discovery to date and no trial
is scheduled. The Company continues to believe the claims are without merit and
intends to defend the action vigorously.

State Derivative Claim Based on the Federal Securities Class Action Suit

In August 2002, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint
purportedly filed on behalf of the Company, captioned In re Juniper Networks,
Inc. Derivative Litigation, Civil Action No. CV 807146, was filed in the
Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. The complaint
alleges that certain of the Company’s officers and directors breached their
fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct
including conduct complained of in the securities litigation described above.
The complaint also asserts claims against a Juniper Networks investor. The
Company is named solely as a nominal defendant against whom the plaintiff seeks
no recovery. In October 2002, the Company as a nominal defendant and the
individual defendants filed demurrers to the consolidated amended shareholder
derivative complaint. In March 2003, the judge sustained defendants’ demurrers
with leave to amend. The plaintiffs lodged their amended complaint in May 2003
and the defendants demurred to the amended complaint and moved to stay the
consolidated action pending resolution of the federal action. On August 25,
2003, the Court sustained defendants’ demurrer with leave to amend and denied
the motion to stay without prejudice. Plaintiffs’ third amended complaint is
due February 24, 2004. There has been limited discovery to date and no trial is
scheduled. The Company continues to believe the claims are without merit and
intends to defend the action vigorously.

Toshiba Patent Infringement Litigation

On November 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit in the United States
District Court in Delaware against the Company, alleging that certain products
infringe four Toshiba patents, and seeking an injunction and unspecified
damages. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims
and intends to defend the suit vigorously.



ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

PART II

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

Our common stock has been quoted on the NASDAQ National Market under the
symbol “JNPR” since June 25, 1999. Prior to that time, there was no public
market for the common stock. All stock information has been adjusted to
reflect the three-for-one split, effected in the form of a stock dividend to
each stockholder of record as of December 31, 1999 and a two-for-one split,
effected in the form of a stock dividend to each stockholder of record as of
May 15, 2000. Juniper Networks has never paid cash dividends on its common
stock and has no present plans to do so. There were approximately 1,520
stockholders of record at January 31, 2004. The following table sets forth the
high and low closing bid prices as reported on NASDAQ:

ITEM 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in
conjunction with Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The information presented below reflects the impact of several accounting
pronouncements, which makes a direct comparison between 2003, 2002 and 2001
difficult. For example, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations,” we have only included
revenue, cost of revenues and operating expenses from Unisphere Networks, Inc.,
which was acquired in July 2002, for the second half of 2002. The results for
2003 include a full year of results for the combined companies. Also, in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we ceased
amortizing goodwill at the beginning of 2002. Furthermore, we issued and
redeemed material amounts of debt securities and we issued material amounts of
equity securities in connection with business combination transactions during
the periods presented below. For a complete description of matters affecting
the results in the tables below, see Note 4 “Long-Term Debt,” Note 5
“Acquisitions” and Note 6 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” of Notes

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Report”), including the “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,
contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future
results of the Company that are based on current expectations, estimates,
forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and
the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the Company. Words such as
’expects,’ ‘anticipates,’ ‘targets,’ ‘goals,’ ‘projects,’ ‘intends,’ ‘plans,’
’believes,’ ‘seeks,’ ‘estimates,’ variations of such words, and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual
results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any
forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such
differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report
under the section entitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere, and in other reports
the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-Q, each as it may be amended
from time to time. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update
publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

The following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to sales returns, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful
accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangible
assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, and
litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Overview of the Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or “we”) was founded in 1996 to
develop and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of
service providers. Today, we are a leading provider of network infrastructure
solutions that transform the business of networking. Our products enable
customers to improve their business models by providing more differentiation
and value to end users as well as increased reliability and security, thereby
making the network a more valuable asset. We sell and market our products
through our direct sales organization and value-added resellers.

Overview of the Results of Operations



To aid in understanding our operating results for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we believe an overview of the significant events that
occurred during those years and a discussion of the nature of the expenses is
helpful.

Significant Events

As a
result of an economic slowdown beginning in 2001 and going into 2003,
many telecommunication service providers cut back capital expenditure
and discretionary spending budgets. These cut backs contributed to the
decrease in our revenues beginning in late 2001 and through 2002.

To help combat the financial impact of the reduction in revenue, we
undertook a series of initiatives. The first initiative was a restructuring in
2001 to better align our operations with the then current market and service
provider industry conditions. This restructuring initiative included a
worldwide workforce reduction, consolidation of excess facilities and
restructuring of certain business functions.

In July 2002, we completed our acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc.
(“Unisphere”), a subsidiary of Siemens Corporation, which is a subsidiary of
Siemens A.G. (“Siemens”). Unisphere developed, manufactured and sold data
networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider
networks. The acquisition enabled us to expand our customer base and add a
complementary product to our existing product line without any need to
reorganize or modify our existing organizational or cost structure. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 141,
“Business Combinations,” we have included in our results of operations for 2002
the results of Unisphere from July 1, 2002. The Unisphere acquisition impacted
revenue, cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of
2002. The results for 2003 include a full year of results of the combined
companies.

In connection with the acquisition of Unisphere, we initiated plans to
eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and
customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating
expenses with existing general economic conditions.

In 2003, we announced that we were no longer developing our G-series CMTS
products and recorded a one-time charge that was comprised of workforce
reduction costs, non-inventory asset impairment, the costs associated with
vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. We
expect this action to facilitate the focus on core competencies and reduce cost
structure.

During
the second calendar quarter of 2003, we issued $400.0 million of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June
15, 2008. Also during 2003, we paid $792.0
million to retire a portion of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
March 15, 2007. These transactions had an effect on our cash, cash
equivalents, investments, interest income and interest expense.

Nature of Expenses

Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations
are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our
cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract
manufacturers. The independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products
using quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls
around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our
facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our
independent contract manufacturers have facilities in Neenah, Wisconsin and
Toronto, Canada. Generally, our contract manufacturers retain title to the
underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take
title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract
manufacturer’s facility.

We realized savings in carrying and obsolete material charges
from 2001 to 2002 and through 2003. The contract manufacturers procure
components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage
is significantly lower than our forecasts,



we may be, and have been in the past, liable
for carrying or obsolete material charges.
During 2001, there was a large expense related to carrying and
obsolete material due to the change in the global
economy and the sudden decrease in product revenues. During the first half of 2002,
the global economy continued to have an adverse effect on our revenues;
however, it began to improve during the second half. In addition, as part of
the Unisphere acquisition, we consolidated our outsourced contract
manufacturing operations from three to two, and incurred additional
carrying and obsolete material charges. Carrying and obsolete charges decreased during 2003 as the
global economy and our product revenue continued to improve.

The primary component of our operating expenses historically has been
employee related costs, which includes items such as wages, commissions,
bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. In addition, the facility and
information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments
based on headcount. Following are descriptions of the unique expense items in
each operating expense class.

We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred.
Research and development expenses include the costs of developing our products
from components to prototypes to finished products, outside services for such
services as certifications of new products, equipment used for testing and
patent related costs. Several components of our research and development
effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new
components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can
cause quarterly variability in our expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and
services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs can vary
quarter-to-quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing
initiatives.

In addition to employee related expenses, general and administrative
expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate
expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and
corporate strategic services.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires us to establish accounting policies that contain
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies include:

•

revenue recognition;

•

the allowance for doubtful accounts, which impacts general and administrative expenses;

•

the valuation of exposures associated with the contract
manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs, both
of which impact cost of product revenues and gross margins; and

•

the provision of income taxes, which would impact our income
tax expense.

We have other important accounting policies and practices. However, once
adopted, these other policies either generally do not require us to make
significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation
of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy itself. We base our
estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe
are standard and reasonable. Despite our intention to establish accurate
estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize product revenue when persuasive



evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed
or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, unless we have future
obligations for such things as network interoperability or customer acceptance,
in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations
are met. In most cases, we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our
customers, including resellers, as it is our policy to ensure an end user has
been identified prior to shipment. Service revenue is recognized as the
services are completed or ratably over the service period.

Beginning July 1,
2003, we recognized revenue on arrangements where products and services were
bundled in accordance with EITF 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.” In applying the concepts of EITF 00-21, we must determine whether the
deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting. We allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the
individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the
residual method, as circumstances dictate. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product
and service revenue recognition. The application of
EITF 00-21 includes judgments whether the delivered item has
value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have
established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the
undelivered items. Our ability to recognize revenue in
the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than
the fair values. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future
will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment
of collectibility. We assess the probability of collection by reviewing our
customers’ payment history, financial condition and credit report. If the
probability of collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until
the payment is collected.

The amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also
impacted by our judgments made in establishing our reserve for potential future
product returns. Although our arrangements do not include any contractual
rights of return, and our general policy is that we do not accept returns,
under unique circumstances we have and may in the future accept product returns
from our customers. Therefore, we do provide a reserve for our estimate of
future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded. Our
estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data
and current economic condition of our customer base. In addition, we get input
from our sales and support organizations on potential product returns relating
to specific customer issues. The amount of revenue we recognize will be
directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential
future product returns.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts
receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In
determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the
creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess
current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of
credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than
previously seen. We also consider our historical level of credit losses. Our
reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. If
actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have
established, our general and administrative expenses would increase.
Conversely, if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our
reserves, our general and administrative expenses would decrease.

Contract Manufacturer Exposures

We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management
operations to our independent contract manufacturers. Accordingly, a
significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our
independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture products
based on our build forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of
future demand for our products. These estimates are based on historical trends
and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for
overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand
are significantly lower than forecast, we have contractual liabilities and
exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs
and obsolete material exposures, that would have an adverse impact on our gross
margins and profitability. Demand for our products and component usage are
largely affected by factors that are outside of our control.

Warranty Reserves

We generally offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products as
well as a 90-day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in
the products. The warranty generally includes parts, labor and 24-hour service
center support. On occasion, the specific terms and conditions of those



warranties vary. We record a liability based on estimates of the costs
that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and charge to cost of
product sales the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized.
Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed
units, our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per
claim. Our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per
claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts. We
periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and
adjust the amounts as necessary. If actual warranty claims are significantly
higher than forecast, or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty
is greater than the forecast, our gross margins could be adversely affected.

Provision for Income Taxes

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax
liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred
tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. We
regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized
from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on
the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets
to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax
assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization
of these assets, in part, due to the potential impact of future stock option
deductions. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves
dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We
recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the
extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts
ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result
in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the
liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is
less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would
result.

Our net revenues for each of the last three years have primarily changed
as a result of the changes in the global economy, which caused fluctuations in
our customers’ capital expenditure budgets. Beginning in mid-2001, the overall
global economy deteriorated and most of our customers reduced their capital
expenditure budgets. We began to see these factors improve in 2003, as was
evidenced by the change in chassis revenue units and ports shipped, as
summarized in the table below.

Our platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the
base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are
available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces.
The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming
packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection
between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The
number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and
throughput offered by the module.



Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was
recognized during the period. Chassis revenue units and ports shipped are
tracked to analyze customer trends and are used as indicators for potential
network growth.

The increase in product net revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 was due
primarily to an increase in the demand for our products resulting from our
customers expanding their networks for new applications and users, partially
offset by a shift in product mix to less expensive products. We did not
experience any unusual pricing pressure in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease
in product net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 was due primarily to a
decrease in the demand for our products that resulted from the generally
unfavorable economic conditions throughout 2002 and a shift in product mix to
less expensive products.

Service net revenues increased each of the last two years as a result of a
larger installed base of customers and products. A majority of service revenue
is from customers who previously purchased our products and enter into a
service contract. In addition to service contracts, service revenue is
generated from providing professional and educational services. Service
contracts are typically for one-year renewable periods and revenue is
recognized ratably over the service period.

Two customers individually accounted for 15% and 13% of total net revenues
in 2003. For 2002, one customer accounted for 17% of net product revenues,
compared to 2001, where one customer accounted for 14%, a second
customer accounted for 13% and a third customer accounted for 11% of net product revenues. Management began including service revenue in its
calculation of significant customers in the second half of 2002.

We experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net
revenues from the Americas region to Europe and Asia during the last two years
as the capital spending market in the United States declined at a greater rate
than the international market. We expect the split among the Americas and
international regions to remain relatively consistent during 2004.

The increase in product gross margins from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due
to savings in outsourced manufacturing costs as a result of improved
efficiencies and cost cutting initiatives at our contract
manufacturers. The increase in product gross margins
was also due to a 62% decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges from 2002
to 2003. In
addition, 2002 included a one-time charge of $5.1 million related to the
Unisphere acquisition for backlog orders and an inventory write-up adjustment.



Product gross margins were flat at 62% for 2002 and 2001 as a result of
operational costs being cut as the demand for our products decreased. The
decrease in absolute dollars for cost of product revenue from 2001 to 2002 was
directly related to the decrease in product revenue, which was primarily a
result of unfavorable economic conditions many customers experienced throughout
2002, as well as to a 37% decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges.

Service gross margins increased from 2002 to 2003 as a result of the 25%
increase in service revenue as compared to only a 13% increase in cost
of service revenues. We were able to grow service revenue at a faster rate than cost
of service revenues due to improved efficiencies and economies of scale that
were a direct result of a larger install base, and thus a more leveraged
service organization. This increased leverage is evidenced by the fact that
total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue
from 29% for 2002 to 27% for 2003, however, in absolute dollars employee
related expenses increased slightly. In addition, in absolute dollars, the
costs associated with spare parts increased by 39% year over year.

Service gross margins increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a
larger installed base of customers and products combined with realized savings
in our service organization for personnel and other related costs associated
with our restructuring activities.

Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and
Administrative Expenses

The following table shows research and development, sales and marketing
and general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage

Research and development expenses increased $14.2 million in 2003 compared
to 2002, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in
absolute dollars was primarily due to a 16% increase in employee related
expenses as a result of a full year of operations after the acquisition of
Unisphere. In addition, we stopped paying bonuses in 2002 as part of our
overall corporate cost cutting initiatives; however, we started to accrue
employee bonuses in the second half of 2003 as our financial results improved.
Offsetting the increase in employee related expenses was a 35% decrease in
consulting and contractor services due to our overall corporate cost cutting
initiatives and a 28% decrease in prototype expenses. Prototype expenses are
closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification
needed before a product can be offered to the public, and the amounts can vary
depending on the product being developed.

Research and development expenses increased $6.4 million and as a percent
of total net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001. The increases were primarily a
result of a 50% increase in headcount related expenses, a 48% increase in the
use of consulting and contractor services, partially offset by 63% savings in
prototype equipment. Headcount related expenses and consulting and contractor
services increased primarily due to the Unisphere acquisition. Prototype
equipment expenses were higher during 2001 because we were preparing for the
release of our high-end T series products, as well as certain M-series and
J-series products, and developing and testing a new family of application
specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

We expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new
products and the enhancement of existing products. We believe that research
and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and
that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of
our customers, we will need to fund investments in several development projects
in parallel.



Sales and marketing expenses increased $19.0 million in 2003 compared to
2002, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The majority of the
increase in absolute dollars was a 32% increase in employee related expenses in
the sales organization as a result of additional headcount and commissions,
resulting from the increase in revenue. In addition, customer facing expenses
such as marketing events and customer programs increased 40%. Offsetting the
increases was a decrease of 41% for demonstration equipment, which is expensed
immediately and is closely tied to product launches. To date, we have not
incurred significant advertising expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased $13.6 million in 2002 compared to
2001, but increased as a percent of net revenues. The decrease in absolute
dollars was a result of a 63% decrease in costs related to employee and partner
events, a 23% reduction in the use of demonstration equipment, and
consolidation of excess facilities, all of which are attributable to our cost
cutting initiatives.

We intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts
across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market
awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers
worldwide. We believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is
critical to our success.

General and administrative expenses decreased $5.8 million and as a
percent of total net revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. The majority of the
decrease was due to a 91% reduction in bad debt expense in 2003 compared to
2002. This reduction was a result of greater than expected collection efforts
and the absence of any significant customer bankruptcies. The decrease in bad
debt expense was partially offset by a 22% increase in professional services
related to certain strategic consulting activities.

General
and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001, but increased as a
percent of total net revenues. The decrease was due
to a 15% savings in employee related expenses and a 12% decrease in the use of
outside services, both of which are attributable to our cost cutting
initiatives.

Restructuring and Other

In the third quarter of 2003, we announced that we are no longer
developing our G-series CMTS products and recorded a one-time charge of
approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs,
non-inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs associated
with termination of contracts and other related costs. Our Board of Directors
approved the restructuring charge and expects that the plan will facilitate the
focus on core competencies and reduce our cost structure. The following table
shows the breakdown of the restructuring charge and the liability remaining as
of December 31, 2003 (in thousands):

The workforce reduction related primarily to the termination of 76
employees that were mainly located in the Americas and Europe regions. We
expect to pay the remaining balance of the severance accrual by the end of the
first quarter of 2004. Non-inventory asset impairment was primarily for
long-lived assets that were no longer needed as a result of our decision to
cease further development of the product line. Facility charges consist
primarily of the cost of vacating facilities that were dedicated to the
development of the G-series CMTS products and the impairment cost of certain
leasehold improvements. The net present value of the facility charge was
calculated using our risk-adjusted borrowing rate. Amounts related to the net
facility charge will be paid over the respective lease term through July 2008.
The difference between the actual future rent payments and the net present
value will be recorded as operating expenses when incurred. Other contractual
commitments and other charges consist primarily of $0.9 million of carrying and obsolete
material charges from our contract manufacturers and suppliers for on-hand and
on-order material related to the G-series CMTS products and $0.9 million of
costs to satisfy end-of-life commitments in certain customer contracts. All of
these costs were included as a charge to the results of operations in the
quarter ended September 30, 2003. Changes to the estimates of executing the
currently approved plans of restructuring will be reflected in results of
operations.

During the third quarter of 2002, in connection with the acquisition of
Unisphere, we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately $14.9 million,
associated primarily with workforce related costs, costs of vacating duplicative
facilities, contract termination costs, non-inventory asset impairment charges
and other associated costs, net of a $2.6 million adjustment due to a change in estimate. As of December 31, 2003, there was $3.1 million
remaining to be paid, entirely related to facility costs to be paid through
April 2009.

We also recognized a charge of approximately $5.3 million during the
quarter ended September 30, 2002 related to the land acquired in January 2001
located in Sunnyvale, California. The charge was primarily for costs of
exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land. We currently
have no plans to continue developing the land in the foreseeable future.

In June 2001, we announced a restructuring program that included a
worldwide workforce reduction, consolidation of excess facilities and
restructuring of certain business functions. As of December 31, 2003, there
was $0.2 million remaining to be paid, entirely related to facility costs to be
paid through August 2006.

Amortization
of Purchased Intangibles and Deferred Stock Compensation

We amortize purchased intangible assets and deferred stock compensation
over their estimated lives. The following table shows the breakdown of the
amortization expenses (in thousands):

Year Ended December 31,

Amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation

$

$

$

The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $6.8 million in
2003 compared to 2002 due to the intangible assets purchased in the Unisphere
acquisition in July 2002. The amortization expense of intangible assets
increased $11.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the intangible assets
purchased in the Unisphere acquisition in July 2002 and a full year of
amortization of the intangible assets purchased in the Pacific Broadband
Communications (“Pacific Broadband”) acquisition in December 2001.

The
amortization expense of deferred stock compensation  was
$2.0 million in 2003, which included a
credit, as required by APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issue to
Employees,” (“APB 25”) of approximately $5.6 million due to employees who
forfeited options for which compensation expense had been recognized on the



graded vesting method, but which were unvested on the date their
employment was terminated. A majority of these employees were a part of the
restructuring plan in 2003.

The amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was $0.4 million
and $74.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary reason for the
decrease was a reversal, as required by APB 25, of $33.5 million in previously
recognized stock compensation expense. This reversal related to the difference
between the expense that had been previously recognized under the
graded-vesting method for former employees and the expense that would have been
recorded using the straight-line method. Finally, the decrease in expense is
also a result of using the graded vesting method, which expenses a larger
percent in the earlier months.

In-Process
Research and Development

In July 2002, we completed the acquisition of Unisphere, a subsidiary of
Siemens. Following the acquisition and during the remainder of 2002, Siemens
was one of our significant resellers. The acquisition resulted in the payment
of $375.0 million cash and the issuance of 36.5 million shares of our common
stock with a fair value of approximately $359.9 million to the former
stockholders of Unisphere. We recorded goodwill of $769.9 million, purchased
intangible assets of $74.0 million, in-process research and development
(“IPR&D”) of $82.7 million and deferred compensation on unvested stock options
of $0.5 million. The intangibles assets, other than goodwill, are being
amortized over their respective useful lives, which we determined to be between
two and six years.

In December 2001, we acquired Pacific Broadband and accounted for the
acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. We allocated $4.2 million
of the $148.3 million purchase price as in-process research and development.
We also originally recorded goodwill of $127.3 million and other intangible
assets of $10.2 million. The intangibles assets have been completely amortized
as of December 31, 2003.

Integration

We incurred integration expenses of approximately $2.5 million in the
quarter ended September 30, 2002 resulting from our acquisition of Unisphere.
Integration expenses are one-time incremental costs directly related to the
integration of the two companies that have no go forward benefit. The
integration expenses consisted principally of workforce related expenses for
individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees.

Amortization
of Goodwill

There was no amortization of goodwill in 2003 and 2002 in accordance with
SFAS 142. Amortization of goodwill was $46.6 million in 2001 from the Micro
Magic, Inc. acquisition, which occurred in 2000.

Interest and other income decreased $23.0 million in 2003 compared to
2002. The decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances
throughout 2003 as we spent $792.0 million to retire a portion of our 4.75%
Convertible Subordinated Notes Due March 15, 2007 (the “Subordinated Notes”),



partially offset by the $392.8 million in net proceeds received from the
issuance of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (the
“Senior Notes”). In addition, interest rates were lower in 2003 as compared to
2002.

Interest and other income decreased $38.3 million in 2002 compared to
2001. The decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances
throughout 2002 as we spent $146.0 million to retire a portion of the
Subordinated Notes and $375.8 million in the Unisphere acquisition. In
addition, interest rates were lower in 2002 as compared to 2001.

Interest and other expenses decreased $16.5 million in 2003 compared to
2002 and $5.8 million in 2002 compared to 2001, almost entirely due to interest
saved from the partial retirement of the Subordinated Notes during each of the
last two years.

During 2003, we paid $792.0 million to retire and redeem a portion of the
Subordinated Notes. These Subordinated Notes had a cost basis of $800.0 million. The retirement resulted in a gain of $14.1 million and the
redemption resulted in a loss of $15.2 million, both of which was the
difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of
their retirement, including unamortized debt issuance costs, and the amount
paid to extinguish such notes.

In the quarter ended September 30, 2002, we paid approximately $146.0
million to retire a portion of the Subordinated Notes. This partial retirement
resulted in a gain of approximately $62.9 million, which was the difference
between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of their
retirement, including unamortized debt issuance costs, and the amount paid to
extinguish such notes.

During the first and second quarters of 2003, we sold some of our
marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale, which had a cost
basis of $4.3 million, and recognized gains of $8.7 million.

We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies
that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we own less than 20%
of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over these companies. We wrote-down these investments $50.5 million
and $53.6 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, for changes in market value
that we believed were other than temporary. There were no such write-downs in
2003.

Equity in net loss of joint venture decreased $2.8 million in 2002
compared with 2001. During the quarter ended June 30, 2001, we entered into a
joint venture agreement with Ericsson A.B., through our respective
subsidiaries, to develop and market products for the wireless Internet
infrastructure market. In addition to this joint venture, Ericsson is also one
of our significant resellers, representing greater than 10% of our revenues in
2003, 2002 and 2001. As of December 31, 2002, we had no further obligations to
fund this joint venture.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes increased to $19.8 million in 2003 from $4.5
million in 2002. The 2003 effective rate was 33.6% and reflects taxes payable
in certain foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of research credits and capital
loss carryforwards and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses.

Provision
for income taxes decreased to $4.5 million in 2002 from
$30.0 million in 2001. The effective tax rates for 2002 and 2001
were

- -3.9% and
181%, respectively. The tax rates for 2002 and 2001 include the effects of
write-downs in equity investments and acquisition related charges for goodwill
and in-process research and development, which are non-deductible.

The IRS is currently auditing the Company’s federal income tax returns for
fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Proposed adjustments have not been received for
these years. Management believes the ultimate outcome of the IRS audits will
not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

Working capital

$

$

438,905

Working capital decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the partial
retirement of the Subordinated Notes, offset by cash provided by operations and
the issuance of common stock through employee stock option exercises and stock
purchase plans. The significant components of our working capital are cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by
accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from
operations will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures,
commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing
operations through at least the next 12 months. In addition, there are no
transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated
entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect
liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources.

As of December 31, 2003, our principal commitments consisted of
obligations outstanding under operating leases, the Subordinated Notes and the
Senior Notes. The contractual obligations under operating leases are primarily
for our facilities. Interest is paid semi-annually on March 15 and September
15 for the Subordinated Notes at an annual rate of 4.75%. Anytime we retire a
portion of the Subordinated Notes, the interest accrued on that portion is due.

The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured
obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and
future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future
debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes, including
our Subordinated Notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible
into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time
prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The
conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of
convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.



We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers.
In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component
supply, the contract manufacturers place non-cancelable, non-returnable
(“NCNR”) orders based on our build forecasts. As of December 31, 2003, there
were NCNR orders valued at $62.5 million. We do not take ownership of the
components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments per
our agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used to
build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers.
The liability for products built by the contract manufacturer is recorded once
they fulfill our customer’s order and the order ships. If the components go
unused, there may be carrying charges or obsolete charges assessed. As of
December 31, 2003, we had accrued $14.6 million for potential exposures with
our contract manufacturers, such as carrying and obsolete material charges.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $178.6 million, $2.4 million
and $292.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for all periods was
due to our net income in 2003 and net losses in 2002 and 2001 adjusted by
ongoing non-cash charges such as:

•

depreciation expense;

•

amortization expenses for intangible assets, deferred compensation and debt costs; and

•

normal fluctuations in accounts receivable, prepaid and other
current assets, long-term assets, accounts payables, accrued
liabilities and deferred revenue.

Unusual and significant adjustments to the net income for 2003 included:

•

a non-cash charge of $3.6 million associated to the impairment of
assets included as part of the restructuring in 2003;

•

the net loss of $1.1 million on the retirement of the Subordinated
Notes;

•

a non-cash tax benefit of $10.8 million related to the exercise of
employee stock options; and

•

a gain of $8.7 million from the sale of investments.

Unusual and significant adjustments to the net losses in 2002 and 2001 include:

Investing Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities was $300.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 and net cash used in investing activities was $295.5
million and $307.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Recurring investing activities included capital expenditures of
$19.4 million, $36.1 million and $241.1 million, respectively. We reduced our
capital expenditures over the past two years as part of our overall corporate
cost cutting initiatives. We have also made investments in securities
classified as available-for-sale and sold investments to fund ongoing
operations, the partial retirement of the Subordinated Notes and the Unisphere
acquisition. We have also made minority equity investments of $0.9 million,
$1.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively, in privately held companies.
Unusual investing activities include (i) an increase of $30.8 million in
restricted cash for the establishment of a trust to secure our indemnification
obligations to certain directors and officers and the purchase of letters of
credit to secure certain facility leases and (ii) $375.8 million paid in 2002
related to the Unisphere acquisition.



Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $307.5 million and $119.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash
provided by financing activities was $58.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2001. We received proceeds during all three years from the issuance of
common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase
plans. We also received $392.8
million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes in 2003 and paid
$792.0 million and $146.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, to retire a
portion of the Subordinated Notes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a
revision to Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46R”). FIN 46R clarifies the
application of ARB No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain
entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support provided by any parties, including the equity holders. FIN 46R
requires the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest
entities (“VIEs”), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary
beneficiary is the entity, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entity’s
expected losses, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns,
or both.

Among other changes, the revisions of FIN 46R (a) clarified some
requirements of the original FIN 46, which had been issued in January 2003, (b)
eased some implementation problems, and (c) added new scope exceptions. FIN
46R deferred the effective date of the Interpretation for public companies to
the end of the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004, except that
all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the
Interpretation to entities that were previously considered “special-purpose
entities” in practice and under the FASB literature prior to the issuance of
FIN 46R by the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15,
2003.

Among the scope exceptions, companies are not required to apply FIN 46R to
an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a “business” as defined in
the Interpretation unless one or more of four named conditions exist. FIN 46R
applies immediately to a VIE created or acquired after January 31, 2003. We do
not have any interests in VIEs.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

We face intense competition that could reduce our market share and
adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.

Competition in the network infrastructure market is intense. This market
has historically been dominated by Cisco with other companies such as Nortel
Networks and Alcatel providing products to a smaller segment of the market. In
addition, a number of other small public or private companies have announced
plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products
address.

If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future
competitors from a product offering standpoint or from potential price
competition by such competitors, we could experience a loss in market share
and/or be required to reduce prices, resulting in reduced gross margins, either
of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results
and financial condition.

The fluctuating economic conditions, combined with the financial condition
of some of our customers, make it difficult to predict revenues for a
particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results.

The recent economic downturn generally, and in the telecommunication
industry specifically, combined with our own relatively limited operating
history in the context of such a downturn, makes it difficult to accurately
forecast revenue.



We have experienced and expect, in the foreseeable future, to continue to
experience limited visibility into our customers’ spending plans and capital
budgets. This limited visibility complicates the revenue forecasting process.
Additionally, many customers funded their network infrastructure purchases
through a variety of debt and similar instruments and many of these same
customers are carrying a significant debt burden and are experiencing reduced
cash flow with which to carry the cost of the debt and the corresponding
interest charges, which reduces their ability to both justify and make future
purchases. The telecommunications industry has experienced consolidation and
rationalization of its participants and we expect this trend to continue.
There have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt
markets for telecommunications industry participants, which have affected their
ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures. In some cases the
significant debt burden carried by these customers has reduced their ability to
pay for the purchases made to date. This has contributed, and we expect it to
continue to contribute, to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of capital
expenditures, further limiting visibility and complicating the forecasting
process. Certain of these customers have filed for bankruptcy as a result of
their debt burdens. Although these customers generally expect that they will
emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings in the future, a bankruptcy proceeding
can be a slow and cumbersome process, further limiting the visibility and
complicating the revenue forecasting process as to these customers. Even if
they should emerge from such proceedings, the extent and timing of any future
purchases of equipment is uncertain. This uncertainty will further complicate
the revenue forecasting process.

In addition, our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated
revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to
be, fixed in the short-term. If we do not achieve our expected revenues, the
operating results will be below our expectations and those of investors and
market analysts, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.

A limited numbers of customers comprise a significant portion of our
revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse
effect on us.

Even though our customer base has increased substantially, we expect that
a large portion of our net revenues will continue to depend on sales to a
limited number of customers. During 2003, Ericsson and Siemens each accounted
for greater than 10% of net revenues. Ericsson was the only customer that
accounted for greater than 10% of net revenues during 2002. Any downturn in
the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly
decrease sales to such customers that could adversely affect our net revenues
and results of operations.

We rely on distribution partners to sell our products, and disruptions to
these channels could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the
sale of our products.

We believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing and
maintaining successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners.
We have entered into agreements with several value added resellers, some of
which also sell products that compete with our products. We cannot be certain
that we will be able to retain or attract resellers on a timely basis or at
all, or that the resellers will devote adequate resources to selling our
products.

Any acquisition we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial
condition if we are not able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and
technologies or if expected benefits of the combination do not materialize.

We have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in
order to enhance our business. For
example, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire NetScreen
Technologies, Inc. in a stock-for-stock acquisition valued at approximately $4
billion at signing. This transaction, if consummated, will dilute our existing
stockholders’ percentage ownership. In addition, some of our results will be negatively impacted due to certain purchase
accounting rules which will result in a write-down of NetScreen’s deferred revenue and other purchase accounting adjustments.
Further, the failure to effectively manage
the acquisition and integration of NetScreen could disrupt our business and
harm our financial results.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including
problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products,
unanticipated costs, diversion of management’s attention from our core
business, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or
limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses,
products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire.



The integration of businesses that we have acquired into our business has
been and will continue to be a complex, time consuming and expensive process.
Failure to operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and
communication system, operating procedures, financial controls and human
resources practices could adversely impact the success of any
business combination. For example, although we completed the
acquisition of Unisphere Networks on July 1, 2002, integration of the products,
product roadmap and operations is a continuing activity and will be for the
foreseeable future. As a result of these activities, we may lose opportunities
and employees, which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results.

We also intend to make investments in complementary companies, products or
technologies. In the event of any such investments or acquisitions, we could
issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership,
incur debt, assume liabilities, incur amortization expenses related to
purchases of intangible assets, or incur large and immediate write-offs.

Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software
or hardware errors, our business could be adversely impacted.

Our products are highly technical and are designed to be deployed in very
large and complex networks. Certain of our products can only be fully tested
when deployed in networks that generate high amounts of IP traffic. As a
result, we may experience errors in connection with such products and for new
products and enhancements. Any defects or errors in our products discovered in
the future could result in loss of or delay in revenue, loss of customers and
increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely impact our
business and our results of operations.

If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks,
installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing
networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple
protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers’
networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over
time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must interoperate
with all of the products within these networks as well as future products in
order to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing
software used in our customers’ networks, we must modify our software to fix or
overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the
existing software and hardware. If our products do not interoperate with those
of our customers’ networks, installations could be delayed, orders for our
products could be cancelled or our products could be returned. This would also
damage our reputation, which could seriously harm our business and prospects.

Traditional telecommunications companies generally require more onerous
terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to
such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may
have an adverse effect on our business.

Traditional telecommunications companies because of their size generally
have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received
more favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous terms and
conditions for their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to this class of
customer, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may
include terms that effect our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse
effect on our business and financial condition.

In addition, many of this class of customer have purchased products from
other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such
functionality and/or had products that caused problems and outages in the
networks of these customers. As a result, this class of customer may request
additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to
deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network
outages that may be caused by our products. These



additional requests and penalties, if we are required to agree to them,
may affect our ability to recognize the revenue from such sales, which may
negatively affect our business and our financial condition.

If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and
product enhancements that meet those needs, or if those products do not gain
market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to
generate revenues will suffer.

We cannot ensure that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or
that we will be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet
such needs or to meet them in a timely manner. If we fail to anticipate the
market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet
those needs, such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and
sales of our present and future products, which would significantly harm our
business and financial results. Even if we are able to anticipate and develop
and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no
assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market
acceptance. Any failure of our future products to achieve market acceptance
could adversely affect our business and financial results.

Our ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed if we are
unable to retain or hire key personnel.

Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive
officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing and support personnel.
None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for
any specific term.

The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to
attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring
required personnel, particularly engineers, could delay the development and
introduction of and negatively impact our ability to develop, market, sell, or
support our products.

If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could
incur additional costs which would harm our results of operations or experience
manufacturing delays which would harm our business.

Our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products for any
specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price, except as
may be provided in a particular purchase order because we do not have long-term
supply contracts with them. In addition, lead times for required materials and
components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific
supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. We
provide to our contract manufacturers a demand forecast. If we overestimate
our requirements, the contract manufacturers may assess charges that could
negatively impact our gross margins. For example, for the quarter ended
September 30, 2001, we recorded a charge for approximately $39.9 million
associated with contractual liabilities and carrying charges on excess material
at our contract manufacturers. If we underestimate our requirements, the
contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt
manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues.

We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several
key components, which make us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations.

With the current demand for electronic products, component shortages are
possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be
limited. We currently purchase several key components, including ASICs, from
single or limited sources. For example, IBM is our ASIC supplier. We may not
be able to develop an alternate or second source in a timely manner, which
could hurt our ability to deliver product to customers. If we are unable to
buy these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver product
to our customers, which would seriously impact present and future sales, which
would, in turn, adversely affect our business.



We currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have
long-term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships, expected or
unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose
revenue and damage our customer relationships.

We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of whom is a third
party manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. We do
not have a long-term supply contract with such manufacturers and if we should
fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or
more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems
in its manufacturing operations, our ability to ship products to our customers
could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and financial
results.

Litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming
and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute or defend, therefore
we may have to expend a substantial amount of resources to make our products
non-infringing and may have to pay a substantial amount of money in damages.

Third parties have and may in the future assert claims or initiate
litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other
intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are
relevant to us. For example, in 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit
against us, alleging that our products infringe certain Toshiba
patents. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include
claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging
infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products.
Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in
costly litigation, require us to develop non-infringing technologies or enter
into license agreements. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court
awards that are not necessarily predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims
may be settled for significant funds. If any infringement or other intellectual
property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail
to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on
commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results
and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

We are a party to lawsuits, which, if determined adversely to us, could
require us to pay damages which could harm our business and financial
condition.

We and certain of our former officers and current and former members of
our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits. There can be no
assurance that actions that have been or will be brought against us will be
resolved in our favor. Regardless of whether they are in our favor, these
lawsuits are, and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party in the
future will likely be, expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve. Any
losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and
cash flow.

The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our
expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead
times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from
quarter to quarter.

A customer’s decision to purchase our products involves a significant
commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification
process. As a result, the sales cycle may be lengthy. Throughout the sales
cycle, we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to
prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even
after making the decision to purchase, customers tend to deploy the products
slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on
the skill set of the customer, the size of the network deployment, the
complexity of the customer’s network environment and the degree of hardware and
software configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers with large
networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis.
Accordingly, we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar
amounts on an irregular basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation
that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead
times, may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and
unexpectedly from quarter to quarter.



Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology and
if licenses of third-party technology do not continue to be available to us or
become very expensive, our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new
products could be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology in certain of our products.
From time to time we may be required to license additional technology from
third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third-party
licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially
reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third party
licenses required in our current products or our inability to obtain
third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product
enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality
or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Due to the global nature of our operations, economic or social conditions
or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales
or increase our costs and expenses, which would have a material adverse impact
on our financial condition.

We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and
indirectly through our resellers in countries outside of the United States and
also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers that are located
outside of the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
we derived approximately 58% and 45% of our revenues, respectively, from sales
outside North America. Accordingly, our future results could be materially
adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors
including, among others, political or social unrest or economic instability in
a specific country or region; trade protection measures and other regulatory
requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from
various countries; service provider and government spending patterns affected
by political considerations; and difficulties in staffing and managing
international operations. Any or all of these factors could have a material
adverse impact on our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition.

If our restructuring initiatives are not sufficient to meet industry and
market conditions and to achieve future profitability, we may undertake further
restructuring initiatives, which may adversely affect our business, operating
results and financial condition.

In response to industry and market conditions, we have restructured our
business and reduced our workforce. The assumptions underlying our
restructuring efforts will be assessed on an ongoing basis and may prove to be
inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future to
achieve certain cost savings and to strategically realign our resources.

While restructuring, we have assessed, and will continue to assess,
whether we should further reduce our workforce and facilities, as well as
review the recoverability of our tangible and intangible assets, including the
land purchased in January 2001. Any such decisions may result in the recording
of additional charges, such as workforce reduction costs, facilities reduction
costs, asset write-downs, and contractual settlements. Additionally, estimates
and assumptions used in asset valuations are subject to uncertainties, as are
accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate
recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including goodwill and other
intangible assets. As a result, future market conditions may result in further
charges for the write down of tangible and intangible assets.

We may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have
undertaken in restructuring our business and, even if successfully implemented,
these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and
market conditions and to achieve future profitability. Furthermore, our
workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future
business objectives. Lastly, costs actually incurred in connection with
restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions
and/or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could
negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.



Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the
United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in non-US currency
exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices
evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and
cash flows.

The majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in US Dollars. We
also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies,
primarily the Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, British Pound and the Euro,
related to our sale and service operations outside of the United States. An
increase in the value of the US Dollar could increase the real cost to our
customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we
sell in US Dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local
operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must
purchase components in foreign currencies.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain
assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically
will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging activities
undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on
certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. Our attempts to hedge
against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our
net income.

Our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to
substantial fluctuations and, as a result we may fail to meet the expectations
of securities analysts and investors, which could adversely affect the trading
price of our common stock.

Our revenues, operating results, book-to-bill ratio and other financial indicators will vary significantly from quarter to
quarter due to a number of factors, including many of which are outside of our
control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate.

The factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly results
include the reduced visibility into customers’ spending plans, the changing
market conditions, which have resulted in some customer and potential customer
bankruptcies, a change in the mix of our products sold, from higher priced core
products to lower priced edge products, and long sales and implementation
cycle.

As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating
results are not a good indication of future performance. It is likely that in
some future quarters, operating results may be below the expectations of
securities analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock
may fall.

If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and
reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business
will be negatively impacted.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business
plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management
process. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and
managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage
our business effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement
improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our business and results
of operations may be negatively impacted.

We sell our products to customers that use those products to build
networks and IP infrastructure and if those networks and IP infrastructure do
not continue to grow then our business, operating results and financial
condition will be adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of IP
infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend
on the continued growth of IP services. As a result of changes in the economy
and capital spending, which have in the past particularly affected
telecommunications service providers, spending on IP infrastructure can vary.
A significant reduction in such spending would adversely affect our business.



Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating
results and future prospects.

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and
financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the
regulations relating to the telecommunications industry. Currently, there are
few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on data
networks. We could be adversely affected by regulation of those networks and
commerce occurring on them in any country where we operate. Such regulations
could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using Internet
Protocol, encryption technology, and access charges for service providers. The
adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products, and at the
same time increase the cost of selling our products, each of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and
maturities. These securities are generally classified as available-for-sale
and, consequently, are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value
with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss).

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact
on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in
interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest earnings of our
investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures.

The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of the
financial instruments held at December 31, 2003 that are sensitive to changes
in interest rates (in thousands):

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than
trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value
arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes
reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or
minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of
the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts.

The majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in US dollars.
However, since we have sales and service operations outside of the US, we do
have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily
the Euro, Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, British Pound and the Australian
Dollar.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and
liabilities denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and
Australian Dollar. These derivatives are not designated as hedges under SFAS
No. 133 (“SFAS 133”), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” At December 31,



2003, the notional and fair values of these
contracts were insignificant. We do not expect gains and losses on these
contracts to have a material impact on our financial results.

We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency
forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses, denominated
primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Australian Dollar.
These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. At
December 31, 2003, the notional and fair values of these contracts were
insignificant. We do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a
material impact on our financial results.

These contracts have original maturities ranging from one to three months.
We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading
purposes. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign
contracts with credit worthy financial institutions.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Juniper
Networks, Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Juniper Networks,
Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respect the information set forth
therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks” or “we”) was founded in 1996 to
develop and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of
service providers. Today, the Company is a leading provider of network
infrastructure solutions that transform the business of networking. Its
products enable customers to improve their business models by providing more
differentiation and value to end users as well as increased reliability and
security, thereby making the network a more valuable asset. The Company sells
and markets its products through its direct sales organization and value-added
resellers.

In July 2002, we completed our acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc.
(“Unisphere”), a subsidiary of Siemens Corporation, which is a subsidiary of
Siemens A.G. (“Siemens”). Following the acquisition and during the remainder
of 2002, Siemens, itself and through its local country affiliates, was one of
our significant resellers. Unisphere developed, manufactured and sold data
networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider
networks. The acquisition enabled the Company to expand its customer base and
add a complementary product to its existing product line without any need to
reorganize or modify its existing organizational or cost structure. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 141,
“Business Combinations,” the Company has included in its results of operations
for 2002, the results of Unisphere from July 1, 2002.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Juniper
Networks and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Investments in operating companies in which the Company intends to
maintain more than a temporary 20% to 50% interest, or otherwise has the
ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity
method. Investments in operating companies in which the Company has less than
20% interest and/or does not have the ability to exercise significant influence
are carried at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires us to establish accounting policies that contain
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies include revenue
recognition; the allowance for doubtful accounts, which impacts general and
administrative expenses; the valuation of exposures associated with the
contract manufacturing operations; estimating future warranty costs, which
impacts cost of product revenues and gross margins; and provision for income
taxes, which would impact our income tax expense. We base our estimates on our
historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are standard and
reasonable.

We have other equally important accounting policies and practices;
however, once adopted, these other policies either generally do not require us
to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require
implementation of the adopted policy not a judgment as to the policy itself.
Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions, actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Juniper Networks considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist
of money market funds, commercial paper, government securities, certificates of
deposit, and corporate debt securities.



Equity Investments

Juniper Networks has certain minority equity investments in privately held
companies. These investments are included in other long-term assets and are
carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as the Company owns less than 20%
of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over these companies. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying
values of the Company’s minority equity investments in privately held companies
were $5.7 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These investments are
inherently high risk as the market for technologies or products manufactured by
these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by
Juniper Networks and such markets may never be significant. The Company could
lose its entire investment in certain or all of these companies. The Company
monitors these investments for impairment by considering financial, operational
and economic data and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when
necessary.

In addition to the equity investments in privately held companies, the
Company held certain marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale. During 2003, the Company sold all of these investments,
which had a cost basis of approximately $4.3 million, and recognized a gain of
approximately $8.7 million.

The following table summarizes the impairment charges associated with
equity investments recorded by the Company (in thousands):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable approximates fair market value due to the relatively short period of
time to maturity. See Note 7 “Cash Equivalents, Short-Term
and Long-Term
Investments and Restricted Cash” for a discussion on the carrying values of our investment
portfolio. The fair values of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due
March 15, 2007 (the “Subordinated Notes”) and the Zero Coupon Convertible
Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (the “Senior Notes”) are based upon quoted
market rates. See Note 4 “Long-Term Debt” for further
discussion on the Company’s Subordinated and Senior Notes.

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject Juniper Networks to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and
trade accounts receivable. Juniper Networks maintains its cash and cash
equivalents and investments in fixed income securities with high-quality
institutions and only invests in high quality credit instruments. Deposits
held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.
Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear
minimal risk. Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company’s customer
base and their dispersion across different geographic locations throughout the
world. Juniper Networks performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. Juniper
Networks maintains reserves for potential credit losses and historically such
losses have been within management’s expectations.

During 2003, two customers each accounted for 15% and 13% of total net
revenue. For 2002, one customer accounted for 17% of product net revenues,
compared to 2001, where one customer accounted for 14%, a second
customer accounted for 13% and a third customer accounted for 11% of
product net revenues. See Note 12 “Segment Information” for a breakdown of net
revenues by geographic location.



Juniper Networks relies on sole suppliers for certain of its components
such as ASICs and custom sheet metal. Additionally, Juniper Networks relies on
two independent contract manufacturers for the production of all of its
products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply
requirements of Juniper Networks could negatively impact future operating
results.

Derivatives

Juniper Networks enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to
mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain assets and
liabilities denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and
Australian Dollar. These derivatives are not designated as hedges under SFAS
No. 133 (“SFAS 133”), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” For the year ended December 31, 2003, these activities were
insignificant. The Company does not expect gains and losses on these contracts
to have a material impact on its financial results.

Juniper Networks also uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge
foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses,
denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Australian
Dollar. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133.
These activities were insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
Company does not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material
impact on its financial results.

These contracts have original maturities ranging from one to two months.
The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or
trading purposes. The Company does not expect gains and losses on these
contracts to have a material impact on financial results.

Juniper Networks did not hold any derivative instruments and did not
engage in hedging activities during 2001.

For currency forward contracts, effectiveness of the hedge is measured
using spot rates for all strategies to value the forward contract and the
underlying hedged transaction. Any ineffective portions of the hedge, as well
as amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized
currently in interest income or expense. If a cash flow hedge were to be
discontinued because it is probable that the original hedged transaction will
not occur as anticipated, the unrealized gains or losses would be reclassified
into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument
would be recognized in income in each period until the instrument matures, is
terminated or is sold.

During 2003 the portion of hedging instruments’ gains or losses excluded
from the assessment of effectiveness and the ineffective portions of hedges had
an insignificant impact on earnings. There was no significant impact to
results of operations from discontinued cash flow hedges as a result of
forecasted transactions that did not occur.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to US dollars
using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses
are translated using average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency
translation gains and losses were not material for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the lesser of

the estimated useful life, generally three to five years, or the lease term of
the respective assets. The land that was acquired in January 2001 (the “Land”)
is not being depreciated. Property and equipment consist of the following (in
thousands):

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization. The Company adopted SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” on January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 prohibits the amortization of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. For business
combinations consummated before July 1, 2001, goodwill was amortized through
December 31, 2001 using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life
of three years. Goodwill is not amortized for business combinations
consummated after June 30, 2001. Goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company
considered the July 2003 decision to cease further development of the G-series
CMTS product as an impairment indicator and, accordingly, reviewed goodwill to
determine if there was any impairment. Since the Company has one reporting
unit, the Company compared its estimated fair value, as measured by it’s market
capitalization, to its net assets as of July 31, 2003 and since the fair value
was substantially greater than the net assets, the Company concluded that there
was no impairment of goodwill at the time of the CMTS product discontinuance.
The Company also performed its annual impairment review during November 2003
and again determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. Amortization of
purchased intangibles with finite useful lives is computed using the
straight-line method over the expected useful life of two to six years. See
Note 5, “Acquisitions,” for detail of the acquisitions where the Company
acquired goodwill and intangible assets and Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased
Intangible Assets,” for detail of the activity in these accounts during 2003
and 2002.

Revenue Recognition

Juniper Networks recognizes product revenue
when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, unless the Company has
future obligations for such things as network interoperability or customer
acceptance, in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those
obligations are met. In most cases, the Company recognizes product revenue
upon shipment to its customers, including resellers, as it is the Company’s
policy and practice to ensure an end user has been identified prior to shipment
to a reseller.

Juniper Networks also recognizes revenue from service contracts. A vast
majority of the Company’s service revenue is earned from customers who have
purchased its products. Service revenue contracts are typically for one-year
renewable periods and are for services such as 24-hour customer support,
non-specified updates, hardware repairs and consulting services. In addition
to service contracts, the Company also provides professional and educational
services. Service revenue is deferred until the services commence, at which
point the service revenue is recognized as the services are completed or
ratably over the period of the obligation.

Beginning July 1, 2003, we recognized revenue on arrangements where
products and services are bundled in accordance with EITF 00-21, “Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” In applying the
concepts of EITF 00-21, the Company must determine whether the
deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting. The
Company allocates the total fee on such
arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair
values or using the residual method, as circumstances dictate. The
Company then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance
with its policies for product
and service revenue recognition. The adoption
did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.



Amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred
revenue and accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The Company accrues for sales returns and other allowances based on
its best estimate of future returns and other allowances.

Research and Development

Costs to develop the Company’s products are expensed as incurred in
accordance with SFAS No. 2, “Accounting for Research and Development Costs,”
which establishes accounting and reporting standards for research and
development.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred
and the totals have been insignificant to date. Marketing development
obligations for customers are charged to either sales or marketing expense in
the period the related revenue is recognized and the totals have been
insignificant to date.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has employee stock benefit plans, which are described more
fully in Note 10, “Stockholders’ Equity.” The Company’s stock option plans are
accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles
of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
Interpretations. As the exercise price of all options granted under these
plans was equal to the market price of the underlying common stock on the grant
date, no stock-based employee compensation cost, other than acquisition-related
compensation cost, is recognized in net income. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” to employee stock benefits, including shares issued
under the stock option plans and under the Company’s Stock Purchase Plan,
collectively called “options.” Pro forma information, net of the tax effect,

Provision for Income Taxes

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax
liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred
tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. The
Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be
realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income
based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes,” and records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax
assets to the amount that it believes to be more likely than not realizable.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax
assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization
of these assets, in part, due to the potential impact of future stock option
deductions. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves
dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The
Company recognizes potential liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and
the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts
ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result
in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the
liabilities are no longer necessary. If the Company’s estimate of tax
liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to
expense would result.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a
revision to Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 “ (“FIN 46R”). FIN 46R clarifies the
application of ARB No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain
entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support provided by any parties, including the equity holders. FIN 46R
requires the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest
entities (“VIEs”), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary
beneficiary is the entity, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entity’s
expected losses, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns,

or both.

Among other changes, the revisions of FIN 46R (a) clarified some
requirements of the original FIN 46, which had been issued in January 2003, (b)
eased some implementation problems, and (c) added new scope exceptions. FIN
46R deferred the effective date of the Interpretation for public companies to
the end of the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004, except that
all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the
Interpretation to entities that were previously considered “special-purpose
entities” in practice and under the FASB literature prior to the issuance of
FIN 46R by the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15,
2003.

Among the scope exceptions, companies are not required to apply FIN 46R to
an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a “business” as defined in
the Interpretation unless one or more of four



named conditions exist. FIN 46R applies immediately to a VIE created or
acquired after January 31, 2003. The Company does not have any interests in
VIEs.

Note 3. Restructuring and Other Operating Charges

The following restructuring charges are based on Juniper Networks’
restructuring plans that have been committed to by management. Any changes to
the estimates of executing the approved plans will be reflected in Juniper
Networks’ results of operations.

2003 Plan

In the third quarter of 2003, the Company announced that it is no longer
developing its G-series CMTS products and recorded a one-time charge of $14.0
million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non-inventory asset
impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs associated with termination of
contracts and other related costs. The Company’s Board of Directors approved
the restructuring charge and expects that the plan will facilitate the focus on
core competencies and reducing cost structure. These charges are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 146, “Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The following table shows the
breakdown of the restructuring charge and the liability remaining as of
December 31, 2003 (in thousands):

The workforce reduction related primarily to the termination of 76
employees that were mainly located in the Americas and Europe regions. We
expect to pay the remaining balance of the severance accrual by the end of the
first quarter of 2004. Non-inventory asset impairment was primarily for
long-lived assets that were no longer needed as a result of our decision to
cease further development of the product line. Facility charges consist

primarily of the cost of vacating facilities that were dedicated to the
development of the G-series CMTS products and the impairment cost of certain
leasehold improvements. The net present value of the facility charge was
calculated using our risk-adjusted borrowing rate. Amounts related to the net
facility charge will be paid over the respective lease term through July 2008.
The difference between the actual future rent payments and the net present
value will be recorded as operating expenses when incurred. Other contractual
commitments and other charges consist primarily of $0.9 million of carrying and obsolete
material charges from our contract manufacturers and suppliers for on-hand and
on-order material related to the G-series CMTS products and $0.9 million of
costs to satisfy end-of-life commitments in certain customer contracts. All of
these costs were included as a charge to the results of operations in the
quarter ended September 30, 2003. Changes to the estimates of executing the
currently approved plans of restructuring will be reflected in results of
operations.

2002 Plans

Restructuring Plan Related to Unisphere Acquisition

During the third quarter of 2002, in connection with the acquisition of
Unisphere, Juniper Networks’ Board of Directors approved and management
initiated plans to restructure operations to eliminate certain duplicative
activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost
structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general
economic conditions. Consequently, Juniper Networks recorded restructuring
expenses of approximately $14.9 million associated primarily with workforce
related costs, costs of vacating
duplicative facilities, contract termination costs, non-inventory asset
impairment charges and other associated costs, net of a $2.6 million adjustment for
costs that were not going to be incurred due to a change in estimate. The adjusted worldwide
workforce reduction



charge of $9.0 million related principally to the termination of 220
employees across many regions, business functions and job classes.
Non-inventory asset impairment of $0.9 million was primarily for long-lived
assets that were no longer needed as a result of the Unisphere acquisition.
Adjusted facility charges of $5.0 million consisted primarily of the cost of
vacating duplicate facilities and the impairment cost of certain leasehold
improvements. These costs are accounted for under EITF Issue No. 94-3 (“EITF
94-3”), “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and
Other Costs to Exit an Activity” and have been included as a charge to the
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

As of December 31, 2003, the balance of the accrued restructuring charge
recorded in conjunction with the restructuring of the Juniper Networks
organization in the third quarter of 2002 consisted of the following (in

Company’s estimated costs to exit these facilities are based on available
commercial rates for potential subleases.

Acquisition Costs Related to Unisphere Acquisition

Juniper Networks also recorded $14.8 million of similar restructuring
costs in connection with restructuring the Unisphere organization. These costs
are accounted for under EITF Issue No. 95-3 (“EITF 95-3”), “Recognition of
Liabilities in Connection with Purchase Business Combinations.” These costs
were recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business combination and
included in the allocation of the cost to acquire Unisphere and, accordingly,
have been included as an increase to goodwill. As of December 31, 2003, there
was $6.6 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facilities, which will be
paid over the respective lease terms through 2009, and professional services.

Other

The Company recognized a charge of $5.3 million during the quarter ended
September 30, 2002 related to the Land acquired in January 2001 located in
Sunnyvale, California. The charge was primarily for costs of exiting certain
contractual obligations associated with the Land and was included in operating
expenses under “Restructuring and other.” The Company has no plans to continue
to develop the Land in the foreseeable future.

2001 Plan

In June 2001, Juniper Networks announced a restructuring program in an
effort to better align its business operations with the current market and
service provider industry conditions. The restructuring program included a
worldwide workforce reduction, consolidation of excess facilities and
restructuring of certain business functions. The costs associated with the
restructuring program totaled $12.3 million and were recorded during the three
months ended June 30, 2001 as operating expenses. As of December 31, 2003,
there was $0.2 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facilities, which
will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2006.

Note 4. Long-Term Debt



In June 2003, Juniper Networks received $392.8 million of net proceeds
from an offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Zero Coupon
Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior
Notes are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with
all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior
to all of the Company’s existing and future debt that expressly provides that
it is subordinated to the notes, including the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated
Notes due March 15, 2007 (the “Subordinated Notes”). The Senior Notes are
convertible into shares of Juniper Networks common stock, subject to certain
conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper
Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal
amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company paid
approximately $381.2 million to retire a portion of the Subordinated Notes.
This partial retirement resulted in a gain of $14.1 million for the difference
between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of their
retirement, including unamortized debt issuance costs, and the amount paid to
extinguish such Subordinated Notes.

During October 2003, the Company called for the redemption on November 26,
2003, of $400.0 million principal amount of its Subordinated Notes. Prior to
November 26, 2003, holders could convert their Subordinated Notes called for
redemption into shares of Juniper Networks common stock at a price of
approximately $163.9559 per share, or 6.0992 shares of Juniper Networks common
stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Subordinated Notes. Upon redemption,
holders received a total of $1,036.508 per $1,000 principal amount of the
Subordinated Notes (consisting of the redemption price of $1,027.14 per $1,000
principal amount of the Subordinated Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon from September 15, 2003 up to but not including November 26, 2003, of
$9.368 per $1,000 principal of the Subordinated Notes). The Company paid
$410.9 million related to this redemption, which resulted in a loss of $15.2
million for the difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes
at the time of their retirement, including unamortized debt issuance costs, and
the amount paid to extinguish such Subordinated Notes. There was a small
amount of the called notes that were converted to shares of the Company’s
common stock worth $2,000.

On or after the third business day after March 15, 2003, Juniper Networks
has the option to redeem the Subordinated Notes at the following redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of principle amount):

Note 5. Acquisitions



In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Juniper Networks allocates the purchase
price of its business acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as in-process research and
development, based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price
over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on
estimates and assumptions provided by management, and other information
compiled by management, including valuations that utilize established valuation
techniques appropriate for the high technology industry.

Unisphere Business Combination

In July 2002, Juniper Networks completed its acquisition of 100% of
Unisphere, a subsidiary of Siemens. The acquisition of Unisphere will enable
Juniper Networks to supply edge applications expertise to the leading service
providers, carriers, and postal, telegraph and telephone providers (PTTs)
throughout the world. Below is a summary of the total purchase price (in

days after the date the transaction was announced. Juniper Networks also
assumed all of the outstanding stock options of Unisphere with a fair value of
approximately $151.2 million. The options were valued using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the inputs of 0.8 for volatility, 2 years for
expected life, 4% for the risk-free interest rate and a market value of $9.86
per share as described above. The total purchase price has been allocated as

In the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company reversed approximately
$2.8 million to goodwill, primarily related to the valuation of certain assets
where we were awaiting further information when we originally allocated the
purchase price. During 2003, the Company reversed approximately $4.3 million
to goodwill, primarily related to liabilities that were accrued at the time of
the acquisition and certain acquisition costs that were not realized.

Amortizable Intangible Assets

Of the total purchase price, approximately $74.0 million has been
allocated to amortizable intangible assets, including completed technology,
service contract relationships, non-compete agreements and order backlog.
Completed technology, which consists of products that have reached
technological feasibility, includes products in Unisphere’s product line,
principally the ERX product. Service contract relationships represent the
potential additional source of revenue from customers with existing service
contracts. Both completed technology and the service contract relationships
were valued using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. This method
calculates the value of the intangible asset as being



the present value of the after tax cash flows potentially attributable to
it, net of the return on fair value attributable to tangible and other
intangible assets. Juniper Networks is amortizing the fair value of the
completed technology and service contract relationships on a straight-line
basis over weighted average remaining useful lives of approximately 5 years and
6 years, respectively.

Non-compete agreements represent the value of the non-compete and
non-solicit agreements signed by key executives from Unisphere. The
non-compete agreements were valued using the lost profits method, which
estimates the value of the future cash flows that would be lost due to customer
defections. The non-solicit agreements were valued using the avoided cost
method, which estimates the avoided costs of replacing solicited employees.
Juniper Networks is amortizing the fair value of these assets on a
straight-line basis over a weighted average useful life of approximately 2
years.

Order backlog represents the value of the standing orders for both
products and services. The order backlog was valued using the avoided cost
method, which estimates the avoided selling expenses due to the fact that
Unisphere had firm purchase orders in place at the time of acquisition.
Juniper Networks amortized the fair value of these assets over the three-month
period ended September 30, 2002 to cost of product revenues.

In-process Research and Development

Of the total purchase price, approximately $82.7 million has been
allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in
the quarter ended September 30, 2002. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent
those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no
alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being
equivalent to a beta-phase working prototype in which there is no remaining
risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, Unisphere had
multiple IPR&D efforts under way for certain current and future product lines.
These efforts included developing new cards and modules for different
bandwidths and various software developments. The Company utilized the DCF
method to value the IPR&D, using rates ranging from 30% to 35%. In applying
the DCF method, the value of the acquired technology was estimated by
discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by
the products with which the technology is associated, over the remaining
economic life of the technology. To distinguish between the cash flows
attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to
other assets available for generating product revenues, adjustments were made
to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working capital and other assets
that provide value to the product lines. At the time of acquisition, it was
estimated that these development efforts were 55% complete and would be
completed over the next six to twelve months. These development efforts were
completed as of December 31, 2003.

Deferred Compensation

Unvested stock options with an intrinsic value of approximately $0.5
million at the time of acquisition have been allocated to deferred compensation
in the purchase price allocation and are being amortized to expense using the
graded vesting method. Options assumed in conjunction with the acquisition had
exercise prices ranging from $5.65 to $14.73 per share, with a weighted average
exercise price of $5.81 per share and a weighted average remaining contractual
life of approximately 9 years. Juniper Networks assumed approximately 13.5
million vested options and approximately 12.5 million unvested options.

Asset Purchase

In 2002, Juniper Networks entered into a Note Purchase Agreement valued at
$2.5 million with third party lenders whereby Juniper Networks purchased
certain secured indebtedness of a private company (the “debtor”) held by the
lenders. The debtor defaulted on the indebtedness and, therefore, Juniper
Networks took possession of the underlying collateral, which included
approximately $1.7 million of fixed assets and approximately $0.8 million of
IPR&D. The Company treated these assets as being acquired in a transaction
other than a business combination in accordance with SFAS No. 142. The Company
capitalized the fixed assets and is depreciating them over their useful lives
and expensed the IPR&D upon acquisition.



Pacific Broadband Business Combination

On December 14, 2001, Juniper Networks acquired 100% of the outstanding
stock of privately held Pacific Broadband Communications, (“Pacific
Broadband”), a developer of standards-based next-generation cable modem
termination systems (CMTS) in which Juniper Networks previously held a minority
interest. As a result of the acquisition, Juniper Networks gained access into
the cable market of the new public network, a new market to Juniper Networks at
the time of acquisition.

The initial purchase price, including the prior investment of $4.0
million, was approximately $148.3 million consisting of an exchange of
approximately 4,612,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value
of approximately $109.8 million, assumed stock options with a fair value of
approximately $30.5 million, and other acquisition related expenses of
approximately $4.0 million consisting of workforce reduction costs, excess
facilities costs, filing fees, as well as payments for professional fees. The
terms of the acquisition also included an earn-out provision, payable in shares
of the Company’s common stock, wherein the former stockholders and employee
option holders of Pacific Broadband could receive additional consideration of
up to $59.0 million, upon achieving certain product development milestones and
revenue targets during 2002. The fair value of the common stock given was
determined using the average market price of the Company’s common stock over
the period including two days before and after the terms of the acquisition
were agreed to and announced. The fair value of the options given was
determined using the Black-Scholes option model.

acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (in thousands):

The $4.2 million assigned to research and development assets was written
off as in-process research and development at the date of acquisition in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4 “Applicability of FASB Statement No.
2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method.” The
applications from the in-process technology project have been integrated into
Juniper Networks’ products. The efforts required to complete the acquired
in-process technology included the completion of all planning, designing and
testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product can be
produced to meet its design requirements, including functions, features and
technical performance requirements. The value of the acquired in-process
technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of 30% on
the anticipated income stream of the related product revenues. The discounted
cash flow analysis was based on management’s forecast of future revenues, cost
of revenues, and operating expenses related to the products and technologies
purchased from Pacific Broadband. The calculation of value was then adjusted
to reflect only the value creation efforts of Pacific Broadband prior to the
close of the acquisition. At the time of the acquisition, the product was
approximately 75% complete. The majority of the costs to complete the project
was incurred in 2002 and was not material. The resultant value of in-process
technology was further reduced by the estimated value of core technology. The
project was complete as of December 31, 2002.

The fair value of the intangible assets was determined based upon a
valuation using a combination of methods, including an income approach for the
core technology and a cost approach for the supply agreements. The goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net



tangible and intangible assets acquired, none of which is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. In accordance with SFAS 142 goodwill was not and
will not be amortized. The deferred compensation charge relates to the
intrinsic value of unvested stock options and restricted stock assumed in the
transaction. The deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of
stockholders’ equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the
applicable options or restricted stock using the graded vesting method.

Under the terms of the Pacific Broadband acquisition, there was an
earn-out provision, payable in shares of the Company’s common stock, wherein
the former stockholders and employee option holders of Pacific Broadband could
receive additional consideration of up to $59.0 million upon achieving certain
product development milestones and revenue targets during 2002. The milestones
achieved to date have a value of $16.5 million, all of which was recorded as
additional goodwill. There are no potential earn-out events remaining. In
addition to the increases in the value of the goodwill acquired through the
Pacific Broadband acquisition, the goodwill was reduced by $4.9 million for
certain liabilities that were accrued for at the time of acquisition that were
not realized.

Note 6. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

The following table presents details of the Company’s total purchased
intangibles assets (in thousands):

The table does not include intangible assets that were purchased and
completely amortized during the three-month period ended September 30, 2002 to

$20.7 million, $13.9 million and $2.7 million were included in operating
expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

year ended December 31, 2001 the net loss would have decreased by
$46.6 million or $0.14 per share.

Note 7. Cash Equivalents, Short-Term and Long-Term Investments and Restricted
Cash

Cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments consist of the following (in thousands):

The Company recognized realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale
securities of $12.0 million, $0.4 million and $5.5 million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The gain in 2002 is net of a $5.0 million impairment
charge on available-for-sale securities recognized in the quarter ended
September 30, 2002 for declines in value that were deemed to be other than
temporary. The cost of a security sold is based on the specific identification
method.



The Company had restricted cash of $30.8 million as of December 30, 2003
related to the establishment of a trust to secure our indemnification
obligations to certain directors and officers and lines of credits for facility
leases. The Company established a trust in the amount of $25.0 million to
secure its indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers
arising from their activities as such in the event that the Company does not
provide or is financially incapable of providing indemnification. The Company
can terminate the trust at the five-year anniversary of establishment and each
five-year anniversary thereafter. Upon termination, the Company has the right
to any amounts remaining in the trust. The trust corpus is restricted cash and
is reported as a long-term asset. The $25.0 million is invested per the
Company’s investment policy and the investments are classified as
available-for-sale; therefore, any changes in valuation are reflected on the
balance sheet.

Note 8. Warranties

Juniper Networks generally offers a one-year warranty on all of its
hardware products as well as a 90-day warranty on the media that contains the
software embedded in the products. The warranty generally includes parts,
labor and 24-hour service center support. The specific terms and conditions of
those warranties may vary depending on the products sold and the locations into
which they are sold. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred
under its warranty obligations and records a liability in the amount of such
costs at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s
warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and
anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. The Company
periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and
adjusts the amounts as necessary.

Stock Option Plans

Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan



The Company’s Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan (the “1996
Plan”) provides for the granting of incentive stock options to employees and
nonstatutory stock options to employees, directors and consultants. Incentive
stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less than the fair value
per share of the common stock on the date of grant. Nonstatutory stock options
may be granted at an exercise price of not less than 85% of the fair value per
share on the date of grant; however, no nonstatutory stock options have been
granted for less than fair market value on the date of grant. Vesting and
exercise provisions are determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted
under the 1996 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period
beginning on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1996 Plan have a
maximum term of ten years. Options granted to consultants are in consideration
for the fair value of services previously rendered, are not contingent upon
future events and are expensed in the period of grant. Juniper Networks has
authorized 146,623,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1996 Plan.
At December 31, 2003, 33,133,000 shares were available for future option
grants or stock sales under the 1996 Plan.

The 1996 Plan also provides for the sale of shares of common stock to
employees and consultants at the fair value per share of the common stock.
Shares issued to consultants are for the fair value of services previously
rendered and are not contingent upon future events. Shares sold to employees
are made pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements containing provisions
established by the Board of Directors. These provisions give Juniper Networks
the right to repurchase the shares at the original sales price upon termination
of the employee. This right expires at a rate determined by the Board of
Directors, generally at the rate of 25% after one year and 2.0833% per month
thereafter. No shares were issued under the 1996 Plan in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, zero and 24,000 shares were subject to
repurchase rights under the 1996 Plan, respectively. At December 31, 2003 and
2002, 3,905,000 and 3,896,000 shares, respectively, had been repurchased under
the 1996 Plan in connection with employee terminations.

2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan

In July 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the Juniper Networks 2000
Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”). The 2000 Plan provides for
the granting of nonstatutory stock options to employees, directors and
consultants. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted at an exercise price of
not less than 85% of the fair value per share on the date of grant; however, no
nonstatutory stock options have been granted for less than fair market value on
the date of grant. Vesting and exercise provisions are determined by the Board
of Directors. Options granted under the 2000 Plan generally become exercisable
over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant. Options granted under
the 2000 Plan have a maximum term of ten years. Options granted to consultants
are in consideration for the fair value of services previously rendered, are
not contingent upon future events and are expensed in the period of grant. As
of December 31, 2003, Juniper Networks had authorized 44,362,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan. At December 31, 2003, 10,804,000
shares were available for future option grants under the 2000 Plan.

Micro Magic, Inc. 1995 Stock Option Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan

In connection with the acquisition of Micro Magic, Inc. in December 2000,
the Company assumed all outstanding options under the Micro Magic, Inc. 1995
Stock Option Plan and the Micro Magic, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the “MMI Plans”). The MMI Plans have been terminated except
with respect to the options outstanding at the time of the acquisition.
Options under the MMI Plans generally become exercisable over a four-year
period beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum term of 10 years.
Juniper Networks has authorized an aggregate of 626,000 shares of common stock
for issuance under the MMI Plans. No shares are available for future option
grants under the MMI Plans. As of December 31, 2003, 111,000 shares were
outstanding under the MMI Plans.

Pacific Broadband Communications, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and 2000
Subplan

In connection with the acquisition of Pacific Broadband Communications,
Inc. (“PBC”) in December 2001, the Company assumed all outstanding options
under the PBC 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and 2000 Subplan (collectively, the
“PBC Plans”). Options under the PBC Plans generally become exercisable



over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant and have a maximum
term of 10 years. Juniper Networks has authorized an aggregate of 1,443,000
shares of common stock for issuance under the PBC Plans. No shares are
available for future option grants under the PBC Plans. As of December 31,
2003, 307,000 shares were outstanding under the PBC Plans.

Unisphere Networks, Inc. 1999 Stock Incentive Plan

In connection with the acquisition of Unisphere in July 2002, the Company
assumed all outstanding options under the Unisphere Amended and Restated 1999
Incentive Plan (the “Unisphere Plan”). Options under the Unisphere Plan
generally become exercisable over a four-year period beginning on the date of
grant and have a maximum term of 10 years. Juniper Networks has authorized an
aggregate of 26,051,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Unisphere
Plan. No shares are available for future option grants under the Unisphere
Plans. As of December 31, 2003, 12,123,000 shares were outstanding under the
Unisphere Plan.

Option activity under all option plans is summarized as follows:

exercisable at an average exercise price of $14.12.

Stock Option Exchange Program

On October 25, 2001, the Company announced a voluntary stock option
exchange program for its employees. Under the program, Juniper Networks
employees were given the opportunity, if they chose, to cancel certain
outstanding stock options previously granted to them with an exercise price
equal to or



greater than $10.00 in exchange for an equal number of replacement options
to be granted at a future date, at least six months and one day from the
cancellation date, which was November 26, 2001. Options granted to certain
employees in two 50% increments in April 2001 and July 2001 were not eligible
for exchange and, if an employee who received such grants elected to
participate in the exchange program, those options were cancelled in their
entirety as a condition to exchanging eligible options for replacement options.
In addition, those employees electing to participate in the exchange program
were required to exchange all options granted to such employees during the
six-month period prior to the cancellation date (except for those options
grants cancelled as described above). Under the exchange program, options for
23,827,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were tendered and canceled, of
which 21,054,000 were eligible for replacement option grants. Each participant
employee received, for each eligible option included in the exchange, a
one-for-one replacement option. The exercise price of each replacement option
was the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on date of grant. The
replacement options had terms and conditions that are substantially the same as
those of the canceled options. The exchange program did not result in any
additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In April 1999, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of Juniper
Networks 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”). The Purchase
Plan permits eligible employees to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock
through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10% of base compensation. Each
employee may purchase no more than 6,000 shares in any twelve-month period, and
in no event, may an employee purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock,
determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time such option is
granted, in one calendar year. The Purchase Plan is implemented in a series of
offering periods, each six months in duration; provided, however, that the
first offering period was approximately thirteen months in duration, ending on
July 31, 2000. The price at which the common stock may be purchased is 85% of
the lesser of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first
day of the applicable offering period or on the last day of the respective
offering period.

During 2003, 1,475,000 shares of common stock were purchased through the
Purchase Plan at an average exercise price of $6.74 per share. As of December
31, 2003, a total of 3,062,000 shares had been issued under the Purchase Plan
at an average price of $7.27 per share, and 8,938,000 shares remained available
for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has elected to follow APB 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock-based compensation plans. Because the
exercise price of the Company’s employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.

The Company has disclosed the pro forma fair value stock-based
compensation information required by SFAS 123 in Note 2, “Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies.” The fair value of each option granted or
assumed through December 31, 2003 was estimated on the date of grant or date of
assumption using the minimum value (before the Company went public) or the
Black-Scholes method. The following shows the assumptions used to calculate
the fair value of the Company’s stock-based awards:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company’s stock-based awards have characteristics significantly
different from those in traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards. The weighted
average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2003,
2002, and 2001 was $8.17, $4.85, and $24.42 per share, respectively. The
weighted average estimated fair value of shares granted under the Purchase Plan
during 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $3.08, $10.44, and $56.30, respectively.

Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

At December 31, 2003, Juniper Networks had reserved an aggregate of
141,994,000 shares of common stock for future issuance under all its Stock
Option Plans, the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and for future issuance
upon conversion of convertible subordinated notes.

Note 11. 401(k) Plan

Juniper Networks maintains a savings and retirement plan qualified under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. All employees
are eligible to participate on their first day of employment with Juniper
Networks. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to 60% of their pretax
salaries per year but not more than the statutory limits. Beginning January 1,
2001 Juniper Networks began matching employee contributions. The matching
formula is $0.50 on the dollar up to 6% of eligible pay (up to an annual
maximum of $2,000). All matching contributions vest immediately. The
Company’s matching contributions to the plan totaled $2.0 million, $2.0 million
and $1.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Note 12. Segment Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” established standards for reporting information about operating
segments in the Company’s financial statements. Operating segments are defined
as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or
decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company operates as one operating segment; however, it tracks
revenue by geographic region. The following table shows net revenues by
geographic region (in thousands):

United States of $28.1 million, $31.1 million and $42.8 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Note 13. Net Income (Loss) Per Share



The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net
income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):

For 2002 and 2001, Juniper Networks excluded 11,510,000 and 16,570,000
common stock equivalents, respectively, consisting of outstanding stock options
and shares subject to repurchase from the calculation of diluted loss per share
because all such securities are antidilutive in that period due to the net
loss. Employee stock options to purchase approximately 13,065,000 shares,
41,271,000 shares and 25,277,000 shares in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share because the exercise price of the stock options was greater than the
average share price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would have
been antidilutive. For 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Subordinate Notes were also
excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because the effect of
the assumed conversion of the notes is antidilutive. In addition, the Senior
Notes were excluded from the calculation of the diluted loss per share in 2003
because the Senior Notes were not convertible by their terms.

Pretax income from foreign operations was $21.2 million, $7.4 million, and
$13.8 million for fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryforward
items and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as follows (in thousands):



Unused net operating loss and research and development tax credit
carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the years 2021 and
2012, respectively. The Company has provided a valuation allowance on its net
deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to
tax losses caused by employee stock option exercises. The net valuation
allowance increased by $28 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, and by
$7.9 million in 2002. At December 31, 2003, approximately $162 million of the
valuation allowance referenced above relates to the tax benefits of stock
option deductions that will be credited to equity when realized. Of the
remaining balance, $36.5 million relates to capital losses that will carry
forward to offset future capital gains, and $9.4 million relates to acquired
net operating losses that will be credited to goodwill when realized.

The provision for income taxes differs from the provision calculated by
applying the federal statutory tax rate to income (loss) before taxes because

The IRS is currently auditing the Company’s federal income tax returns for
fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Proposed adjustments have not been received for
these years. Management believes the ultimate outcome of the IRS audits will
not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

Note 15. Joint Venture

During the quarter ended June 30, 2001, Juniper Networks and Ericsson
A.B., through their respective subsidiaries, entered into a joint venture
agreement to develop and market products for the wireless Internet
infrastructure market and Juniper Networks began recording its 40% share of the
joint venture’s loss. During 2002, the Company’s share of the joint venture’s
loss totaled approximately $1.3 million, and is recorded as a single line item
in the other income section of the statement of operations. As of December 31,
2002, the Company has no further obligations to fund this joint venture.

Note 16. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to legal claims and litigation arising in the
ordinary course of business, including the matters described below. The
outcome of these matters is currently not determinable.



However, the Company does not expect that such legal claims and litigation
will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson
Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG Cowen
Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase
(Hambrecht & Quist LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc.,
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated
(collectively, the “Underwriters”), the Company and certain of the Company’s
officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s
common stock in the Company’s initial public offering in June 1999 and its
secondary offering in September 1999.

Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the
prospectus pursuant to which shares of common stock were sold in the Company’s
initial public offering and its subsequent secondary offering contained certain
false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the practices of the
Underwriters with respect to their allocation of shares of common stock in
these offerings and their receipt of commissions from customers related to such
allocations. Various plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar
allegations concerning the initial public offerings of approximately 300 other
issuers. These various cases pending in the Southern District of New York have
been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as In re Initial Public Offering
Securities Litigation, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, plaintiffs filed a consolidated
amended complaint in the action against the Company, alleging violations of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Defendants in
the coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. In October 2002, the
Company’s officers were dismissed from the case without prejudice pursuant to a
stipulation. On February 19, 2003, the Court granted in part and denied in part
the motion to dismiss, but declined to dismiss the claims against the Company.
A proposal has been made for the settlement and release of claims against the
issuer defendants, including the Company. The settlement is subject to a number
of conditions, including approval of the proposed settling parties and the
court. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation against the Company
continues, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to
defend the case vigorously.

Federal Securities Class Action Suit

During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, a number of essentially identical
shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain
of its officers and former officers purportedly on behalf of those stockholders
who purchased the Company’s publicly traded securities between April 12, 2001
and June 7, 2001. In April 2002, the judge granted the defendants’ motion to
consolidate all of these actions into one; in May 2002, the court appointed
the lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of lead counsel and an amended
complaint was filed in July 2002. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants
made false and misleading statements, assert claims for violations of the
federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief. In September 2002, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended
complaint. In March 2003, the judge granted defendants motion to dismiss with
leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint in April 2003 and
the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in May 2003. The hearing
on defendants’ motion to dismiss was held on September 12, 2003. The judge has
not yet ruled on the motion. There has been no discovery to date and no trial
is scheduled. The Company continues to believe the claims are without merit and
intends to defend the action vigorously.

State Derivative Claim Based on the Federal Securities Class Action Suit

In August 2002, a consolidated amended shareholder derivative complaint
purportedly filed on behalf of the Company, captioned In re Juniper Networks,
Inc. Derivative Litigation, Civil Action No. CV 807146, was filed in the
Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. The complaint
alleges that certain of the Company’s officers and directors breached their
fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct
including conduct complained of in the securities litigation described above.
The complaint also asserts claims against a Juniper Networks investor. The
Company



is named solely as a nominal defendant against whom the plaintiff seeks no
recovery. In October 2002, the Company as a nominal defendant and the
individual defendants filed demurrers to the consolidated amended shareholder
derivative complaint. In March 2003, the judge sustained defendants’ demurrers
with leave to amend. The plaintiffs lodged their amended complaint in May 2003
and the defendants demurred to the amended complaint and moved to stay the
consolidated action pending resolution of the federal action. On August 25,
2003, the Court sustained defendants’ demurrer with leave to amend and denied
the motion to stay without prejudice. Plaintiffs’ third amended complaint is
due February 24, 2004. There has been limited discovery to date and no trial is
scheduled. The Company continues to believe the claims are without merit and
intends to defend the action vigorously.

Toshiba Patent Infringement Litigation

On November 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit in the United States
District Court in Delaware against the Company, alleging that certain products
infringe four Toshiba patents, and seeking an injunction and unspecified
damages. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims
and intends to defend the suit vigorously.

Note 18. Subsequent Events



In February 2004, Juniper Networks signed an agreement to acquire
NetScreen Technologies, Inc., in a stock-for-stock merger transaction. Based
upon Juniper Networks closing stock price of $29.47 on February 6, 2004, the
deal has an approximate value of $4 billion. If the transaction is completed,
Juniper Networks stock will be exchanged for NetScreen Technologies stock at a
fixed exchange ratio of 1.404 shares of Juniper Networks common stock for each
outstanding share of NetScreen Technologies common stock.

The
acquisition is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2004 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by
the stockholders of both companies and regulatory approvals.
