PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

We design, develop, and sell innovative products and services that together provide our customers with high-performance network infrastructure

built on simplicity, security, openness and scale. We ser

ve the high-performance networking requirements of global service providers, enterprises, and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success. We believe we are well positioned in the networking industry based on our core competencies in architecture, silicon design, and our open cross-network software platform that includes the Junos® operating system (“Junos OS”), Junos Space network application platform, and Junos Pulse integrated network client. We offer a broad product portfolio that spans routing, switching, security, application access, and mobility device security, which is designed by management to provide performance, choice, and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership. In addition, through strong industry partnerships, we are fostering innovation across the network.

Our operations are organized into two reportable segments: Infrastructure and Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”). Our Infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used to control and direct network traffic from the core, through the edge, aggregation, and the customer premise equipment level. Infrastructure products include our Internet Protocol (“IP”) routing, carrier Ethernet routing portfolio, and Ethernet switching portfolio. Additionally, the Infrastructure segment offers a complete wireless local area network ("WLAN") solution that provides high reliability, performance, security, and management for mobile applications. Our SLT segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customers' priorities, from protecting the users, applications and data on the network itself to providing network services across a distributed infrastructure. Both segments offer worldwide services, including technical support and professional services, as well as educational and training programs to our customers. Together, our high-performance product and service offerings help our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation, value, and increased performance, reliability, and security to end-users. See Note 13,

Our Strategy

Our objective and strategy is to be the leading provider of high-performance network infrastructure by transforming the experience and economics of networking.

Our strategy is centered on innovation and customer value. Key elements of our strategy are described below.

Maintain and Extend Technology Leadership

We are recognized around the world as the innovation leader in networking. Our Junos OS, application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) technology, and network-optimized product architecture have been key e

lements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership. We believe that these elements can be leveraged for future products that we are currently developing. We intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership in the service provider and enterprise markets primarily through innovation and continued investment in research and development (“R&D”), supplemented by external partnerships, including strategic alliances and strategic acquisitions that would allow us to deliver a broad range of products and services to customers in target markets.



Leverage Position as Supplier of High-Performance Network Infrastructure

We are a pure play in high-performance networking. From inception, we have focused on designing, developing, and building high-performance network infrastructure for demanding service provider and enterprise networking environments and have integrated purpose-built technology into a network-optimized architecture that specifically meets customer needs. We believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors, and that the performance, reliability, and security of our products will provide us with a competitive advantage, which is critical to be selected as one of these vendors.

Be Strategic to Our Customers

In developing our Infrastructure and SLT solutions, we work very closely with customers to design and build best-in-class products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs. Over time, we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers, which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products. We believe our close relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date. We plan to continue to work hand-in-hand with our customers to implement product enhancements, as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace, while enabling customers to reduce costs. We are committed to investing in R&D at a level that drives our innovation agenda, enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers.

Enable New IP-Based Services

Our platforms enable network operators to quickly build and secure networks cost-effectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products. We believe that the secure delivery of IP-based services and applications, including web hosting, outsourced Internet and intranet services, outsourced enterprise applications, and voice-over IP, will continue to grow and benefit from cost efficiencies enabled by our high-performance network infrastructure offerings. By enabling these new IP-based services, we have significantly broadened our service provider business over the last several years while also significantly expanding our presence in the enterprise market.

Establish and Develop Industry Partnerships

Our customers have diverse requirements. Wh

ile our products meet certain requirements of our customers, our products are not intended to satisfy all of their requirements. Therefore, we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers. These partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services, whether through technology integration, joint development, resale, or other collaboration, in order to better support a broader set of our customers' requirements. In addition, we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements, while enabling them to reduce costs.

Markets and Customers

We sell our high-performance network products and service offerings through direct sales and through distributors, value-added resellers, and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners to end-users in the following markets:

Service Providers

Service providers include wireline, wireless, and cable operators, as well as major Internet content and application providers. We support most major service provider networks in the world and our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance, reliability, and security that service providers demand. We believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by:

•

Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple services over the same network using our high density and highly reliable platforms;

•

Creating new or additional revenue opportunities by enabling new services to be offered to new market segments based on our product capabilities;

•

Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by enabling consumers to self-select automatically provisioned service packages that provide the quality, speed, and pricing they desire; and



•

Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on investment as their networks can scale to multi-terabit rates based on the capabilities of our platforms.

While many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline, wireless, or cable operators, in recent years, we have seen a move towards convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships. We believe these strategic developments are made technically possible as operators invest in the build out of next generation networks capable of supporting voice, video, and data traffic on to the same IP-based network. This convergence relies on IP-based traffic processing and creates the opportunity for multi-service networks and offer service providers significant new revenue opportunities.

We believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions. These trends include significant growth in IP traffic on service provider networks because of peer-to-peer interaction, broadband usage, video, an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our IP customers and of their enterprise customers, the advent of datacenter "clouds" that concentrate business applications in large, IP network connected facilities, and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including notebooks, netbooks, smartphones, and tablets.

The IP infrastructure market for service providers includes: products and technology at the network core; the network edge to enable access; the aggregation layer; security to protect from the inside out and the outside in; the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs; and the management, service awareness, and control of the entire infrastructure.

Enterprise

Our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance, reliability, and security requirements of the world's most demanding businesses. Enterprises and public sector organizations, such as governments and research and education institutions, that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge applications. In addition, our solutions:

•

Assist in the consolidation and delivery of existing services and applications;

•

Accelerate the deployment of new services and applications;

•

Offer integrated security to assist in the protection and recovery of services and applications; and

•

Offer operational improvements that enable cost reductions, including lower administrative, training, customer care, and labor costs.

As with the service provider market, innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market. High-performance enterprises require networks that are global, distributed, and always available. Network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance, reliability, and security with best-in-class open solutions for maximum flexibility. We offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers, branch and campus applications, distributed and extended enterprises, and Wide Area Network (“WAN”) gateways.

As customers increasingly view the network as critical to their success, we believe that customers will increasingly demand fast, reliable, and secure access to services and applications over a single IP-based network. This is partly illustrated by the success of our SRX Services Gateways that consolidate switching, routing, and security services in a single device, Integrated Security Gateway (“ISG”) products that combine firewall/virtual private network (“VPN”) and intrusion detection and prevention (“IDP”) solutions in a single platform, and Secure Services Gateway (“SSG”) platforms that provide a mix of high-performance security with Local Area Network (“LAN”)/WAN connectivity for regional and branch office deployments. We will continue to invest to develop these and other converged technologies and solutions.

Customers with Ten Percent of Net Revenues or Greater

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total net revenues for 2011. Verizon Communications, Inc. accounted for greater than 10% of our total net revenues in 2010. AT&T, Inc., accounted for greater than 10% of our total net revenues in 2009.



Our Products and Technology

Early in our history, we developed, marketed, and sold the first commercially available purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the specific high-performance requirements of service providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to increase, the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created.

Our Infrastructure products are designed to address the needs at the core and the edge of the network, as well as for wireless access, by combining high-performance packet forwarding technology and robust operating systems into a network-optimized solution. In addition, as enterprises continue to develop and rely upon more sophisticated and pervasive internal networks, we believe the need for products with high-performance routing and switching technology is expanding to a broader set of customers, and we believe our expertise in this technology well positions us to address this growing market opportunity.

Additionally, our SLT segment offers a broad family of network security solutions that deliver high-performance, cost-effective security for enterprises, service providers, and government entities, including integrated firewall and VPN solutions, secure sockets layer (“SSL”) VPN appliances, and IDP appliances. We also offer complementary products and technologies to enable our customers to provide additional IP-based services and enhance the performance and security of their existing networks and applications.

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for an analysis of net product revenues by segment.

Platform Strategy

In addition to our major product families, our extended software portfolio, known as Junos Platform, is a key technology element in our strategy to be the leader in high-performance networking. The Junos Platform enables our customers to expand network software into the application space, deploy software clients to control delivery, and accelerate the pace of innovation with an ecosystem of developers. The Junos Platform includes:

•

Junos OS

- At the heart of the Junos Platform is Junos OS. We believe Junos OS is fundamentally superior to other network operating systems in not only its design, but also in its development capabilities. The advantages of Junos OS include:

◦

One modular operating system with single source base of code and a single, consistent implementation for each control plane feature;

◦

One software release train extended through a highly disciplined and firmly scheduled development process; and

◦

One common modular software architecture that scales across all Junos-based platforms.

Junos OS is designed to maintain continuous systems and improve the availability, performance, and security of business applications running across the network. Junos OS helps to automate network operations by providing a single consistent implementation of features across the network in a single release train that seeks to minimize the complexity, cost, and risk associated with implementing network features and upgrades. This operational efficiency



allows network administrators more time to innovate and deliver new revenue-generating applications, helping to advance the economics of high-performance networking.

The security and stability of Junos OS, combined with its modular architecture and single source code base, provides a foundation for delivering performance, reliability, security, and scale at a lower total cost of ownership than multiple operating code base environments. With an increasing number of our platforms able to leverage Junos OS, including routing, switching, and security products, we believe Junos OS provides us a competitive advantage over other major network equipment vendors.

Our Junos Space network management platform offers an open, Service-Oriented Architecture-based ("SOA") platform for creating organic and third party network management applications to drive network innovation.  Junos Space includes applications for network infrastructure management and automation that help customers reduce operational cost and complexity and scale services. These include Network Activate, Ethernet Design, Route Insight, Security Design, Virtual Control, Service Now and Service Insight.

•

Junos Pulse -

Junos Pulse is a dynamic, integrated network client that delivers unified location-aware, identity-enabled network security, connectivity, access, and acceleration. It simplifies mobility and streamlines fast network and application access regardless of location, while supporting select third-party application development and integration.

Major Product Development Projects

During 2011, we introduced our network architecture and fabric technology for the data center, QFabric, that enables customers to scale their network faster and achieve significant improvement in performance, and released the three core components of QFabric-the Node, Interconnect and Director.  We unveiled Converged Supercore solution, the PTX Series, an integrated packet transport system that enables service and content providers to accommodate new levels of peak bandwidth demand. We expect to begin shipping our PTX Series switches toward the end of the first quarter of 2012.  We also released the T4000 Core Router, a multi-chassis capable system that delivers 4Tbps of traffic in a single half rack routing node.  Our software is a key differentiator that drives customer adoption of our solutions. We introduced our MobileNext software, releasing the GGSN and P Gateway and S Gateway for mobile operators. We also announced Junos Pulse Mobile Security Suite support on Android devices, Apple iOS devices, the vGW Virtual Gateway virtualized security solution for private and public clouds and the integration of vGW with our SRX platform, as well as the Security Design application on Junos Space platform for developing and deploying network applications. Additionally, we launched Junosphere, a cloud offering that allows network operators to create and run networks on-demand, and delivered an OpenFlow application built on the Junos Software Developer Kit to expand the available toolset for enhancing network flexibility and programmability.

Customer Service

In addition to our Infrastructure and SLT products, we offer support, professional, and educational services. We deliver these services directly to end-users and utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our partners and third-party organizations, as appropriate.

We also train our channel partners in the delivery of support, professional, and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered.

As of December 31, 2011, we employed

1,289

people in our worldwide customer service and support organization. We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products, and we have hired support engineers with proven network experience to provide those services.

Manufacturing and Operations

As of December 31, 2011, we employed


people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor and manage product testing and quality.

We have subcontracted the majority of our manufacturing activity with Celestica Incorporated, Flextronics International LTD, Plexus Corporation, and Accton Technology. Our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers in the United States, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and Taiwan.



Our contract manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers, and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers, we design, specify, and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards. These arrangements provide us with the following benefits:

•

We can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing and drop-shipment capabilities;

•

We gain economies of scale by leveraging our buying power with our contract manufacturers when we purchase large quantities of components;

•

We operate with a minimum amount of dedicated space for Manufacturing Operations; and

•

We can reduce our costs by reducing what would normally be fixed overhead expenses.

Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts. Each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to our specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors, value-added resellers, or end-users. Generally, we do not own the components, and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components remain unused or the products remain unsold for specified period, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer may accept purchase orders from us. The contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long-term basis.

We also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to ensure adequate component supplies. The majority of our inventory is production components. As a result, we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges, particularly in light of current macroeconomic conditions and the resulting uncertainties in future product demand.

Our ASICs are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources, such as International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), each of which is responsible for all aspects of ASICs production using our proprietary designs.

By working collaboratively with our suppliers, we have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain. To this end, we have adopted, and promote other to adoption, the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (“EICC”). The EICC outlines standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, workers are treated with respect and dignity, and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.

Research and Development

We have assembled a team of skilled engineers with extensive experience in the fields of high-end computing, network system design, ASIC design, security, routing protocols, software applications and platforms, and embedded operating systems. As of December 31, 2011, we employed

4,138

people in our worldwide R&D organization.

We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology, developing additional applications, integrating that technology, and maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of our product and service offerings. In our Infrastructure and SLT products, we are leveraging our software ASIC and systems technology, developing additional network interfaces targeted to our customers' applications, and continuing to develop technology to support the anticipated growth in IP network requirements. We continue to expand the functionality of our products to improve performance reliability and scalability, and to provide an enhanced user interface.

Our R&D process is driven by the availability of new technology, market demand, and customer feedback. We have invested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for all product development projects. Following an assessment of market demand, our R&D team develops a full set of comprehensive functional product specifications based on inputs from the product management and sales organizations. This process is designed to provide a framework for defining and addressing the steps, tasks, and activities required to bring product concepts and development projects to market. Expenditures for R&D were

$1,026.8 million

,

$917.9 million

, and

$741.7 million

in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.



Sales and Marketing

As of December 31, 2011, we employed

2,568

people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization. These sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers.

Our sales organization, with its structure of sales professionals, system engineers, and marketing and channel teams, is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers. Within each team, sales team members serve the following three geographic regions: (i) Americas (including United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America), (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and (iii) Asia Pacific (“APAC”). Within each region, there are regional and country teams, as well as major account teams, to ensure we operate close to our customers.

See Note 13,

Segment Information

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information concerning our revenues by geographic regions and by significant customers, which is incorporated herein by reference. Our operations subject us to certain risks and uncertainties associated with international operations. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” for more information.

Our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below.

In the United States and Canada, we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers. Almost all of our sales outside the United States and Canada are made through our channel partners.

Direct Sales Structure

Our sales team engages with customers with which we have direct relationships.  The terms and conditions of these arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts.  The direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products.  We directly receive and process customer purchase orders.

Channel Sales Structure

A critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we do the majority of our sales. We employ various channel partners, including but not limited to:

•

A global network of strategic distribution relationships, as well as region-specific or country-specific distributors who in turn sell to local value-added resellers who sell to end-user customers. Our distribution channel partners mainly sell our SLT products plus certain Infrastructure products that are often purchased by our enterprise customers. These distributors tend to be focused on particular regions or countries within regions. For example, we have substantial distribution relationships with Ingram Micro in the Americas and with NEC in Japan. Our agreements with these distributors are generally non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require our distributors to purchase specified quantities of our products.

•

Direct value-added resellers, including our strategic worldwide resellers referenced below, resell our products to end-users around the world. These direct value-added resellers buy the products and services directly from us and have expertise in deploying complex networking solutions in their respective markets. Our agreements with these direct value-added resellers are generally non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require our direct value-added resellers to purchase specified quantities of our products. Increasingly, our service provider customers also resell our products to their customers or purchase our products for the purpose of providing managed services to their customers.

•

Strategic worldwide reseller relationships with Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. ("NSN"), Ericsson Telecom A.B. (“Ericsson”), and IBM. These companies each offer services and products that complement, but in some cases compete with, our own product offerings and act as a fulfillment partner for our products. Our arrangements with these partners allow them to resell our products on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for product discounts, and specify other general terms of sale. These agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products.



•

OEM relationships with Dell Corporation and IBM. Our OEM arrangements with these partners allow them to rebrand and resell certain of our product lines on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for product discounts, and specify other general terms of sale. These agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products.

In addition to our sales that are direct to customers or that are made entirely through channel partners, we have a “direct touch” sales team that works directly with channel partners on key accounts in order to maintain a direct relationship with our more strategic end-user customers while at the same time supporting the ultimate fulfillment of product through our channel partners.

Backlog

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers. At any given time, we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped. Because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty, we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results. As of December 31, 2011, and 2010, our total product backlog was approximately

$301 million

and

$330 million

, respectively. Our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers, generally within the next six months,

and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sell-through to end-users, certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals, sales return reserves, service revenue allocations, and early payment discounts.

Seasonality

Many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the first and third quarters. In addition, our SLT segment generally experiences seasonally strong customer demand in the fourth quarter. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance.

Competition

Infrastructure Business

In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") has historically been the dominant player in the market. However, other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. ("Brocade"), Extreme Networks, Inc., Hewlett Packard Company ("HP"), and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. ("Huawei") are also our principal competitors.

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, HP, and Huawei bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors, can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, negatively affecting our operating results.

SLT Business

In the market for SLT products, Cisco generally is our primary competitor with its broad range of products. In addition, there are a number of other competitors for each of the product lines within SLT, including Check Point Software Technologies, F5 Networks, In

c., Palo Alto Networks, Inc., and R

iverbed Technology, Inc. These additional competitors tend to be focused on single product line solutions and, therefore, may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line. In addition, a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address. We believe that our ability to compete with Cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers.

For both product groups, we expect that over time, large companies with significant resources, technical expertise, market experience, customer relationships, and broad product lines, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei, will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market. There are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products. There continues to be consolidation in this industry, with smaller companies being acquired by larger, established suppliers of network infrastructure products. We believe this trend is likely to continue.



As a result, we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have. Although we believe that our technology and the purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful.

Environment

We are subject to regulations that have been adopted with respect to environmental matters, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”), Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations adopted by the European Union. In addition, we participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”). CDP is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors. It hosts one of the largest registries of corporate greenhouse gas data in the world at www.cdproject.net. We continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis. We believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world.

To date, compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

In addition, we are committed to the environment by our effort in improving the energy efficiency of key elements in our high-performance network product offerings. For example, our T1600 router consumes substantially less energy than competitive products. The environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise.

While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark law to protect our technology, we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology.

In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time, we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. There can be no assurance that third-party licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed, that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights.

As of December 31, 2011, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 1,300 patents.  Patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing.  As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary.

Employees

As of December 31, 2011, we had

9,129

full-time employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. We believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.

Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical, sales, and senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time. The loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, train, and retain highly qualified technical, sales, and managerial personnel. Competition for suc

h key personnel is intense, and in order to attract and retain these



personnel, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and share-based compensation. Our share-based incentive awards include stock options, restricted stock units and performance share awards, some of which contain conditions relating to our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such share-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could be weakened. There can be no assuran

ce that we can retain our key personnel in the future.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Investments in our securities involve significant risks. The market price of our stock has historically reflected a higher multiple of earnings than many other companies. Accordingly, even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings, whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results, changes in the mix of the products and services sold, acquisitions, industry changes, or other factors, could trigger, and have triggered in the past, significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. Investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the following factors, that could affect our stock price.

Our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations, and, as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate.

The factors that may cause our quarterly results to be unpredictable include, but are not limited to: limited visibility into customer spending plans, changes in the mix of products and services sold, changes in geographies in which our products and services are sold, changing market and economic conditions, current and potential customer consolidation, competition, customer concentration, long sales and implementation cycles, regional economic and political conditions, and seasonality. For example, many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending, particularly in the first and third quarters.

As a result of these risk factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely that in some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock may decline. Such a decline could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenues and/or earnings guidance.

Fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results.

Our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have resulted in certain historical periods, and may in the future result in decreased revenues and earnings and could make it difficult to forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses. In addition, economic weakness, particularly in the United States and Europ

e, concerns over the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the European Union, the downgrade by Standard and Poor's (S&P) of the U.S. long-term sovereign credit rating, as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions, which could lead to reduced demand for our products and/or higher costs of production. Continued economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers, an increase in customer bad debt, restructuring initiatives and associated expenses, and impairment of investments. Furthermore, the continued weakness and uncertainty in worldwide credit markets, including the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the European Union, may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures, which could lead to delays

or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services. In addition, our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is, and will continue to be, fixed in the short and medium term.

Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Future or continued economic weakness, failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness, customer financial difficulties, increases in costs of production, and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

A limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenues from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results.



A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners. Changes in the business requirements, vendor selection, financial prospects, capital resources, and expenditures, or purchasing behavior (including product mix purchased) of our key customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services, which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, in recent years, there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry (for example, the acquisitions of Global Crossing and Qwest Communications and AT&T's failed acquisition of T-Mobile) and that consolidation trend has continued. If our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or other unforeseen cons

equences could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we receive product orders late in a quarter, we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period, which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues.

Generally, our Infrastructure products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and configurations required by our customers, and we generally build such products as orders are received. In recent years, the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter has generally continued to increase but remains unpredictable. If orders for certain products are received late in any quarter, we may not be able to build, ship, and recognize revenue for these orders in the same period, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter. Additionally, we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term. As a result, a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter-to-quarter.

The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.

A customer's decision to purchase certain of our pro

ducts, particularly new products, involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the sales cycle may be length

y. In particular, customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders. Throughout the sales cycle, we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer, the size of the network deployment, the complexity of the customer's network environment, and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter-to-quarter.

We face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results.

Competition is intense in the markets that we address. The Infrastructure market has historically been dominated by Cisco with competition coming from other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade, Extreme Networks, Hewlett Packard Company, and Huawei. In the SLT market, we face intense competition from a broader group of companies such as Check Point, Cisco, F5 Netwo

rks, Palo Alto Networks, and Riverbe

d. In addition, a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address.

In addition, actual or speculated consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and/or resellers by competitors, can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions. In this regard, Ericsson acquired Redback in 2007, and Brocade acquired Foundry Networks in 2009. A number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price, we could experience a loss in market share and revenues and/or be required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins, and which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



We expect our gross margins to vary over time, and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable.

We expect our product gross margins to vary from quarter-to-quarter, and the gross margins we have recently achieved may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors, including product mix shifts, increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete, increases in material or labor costs, excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers, increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately forecast product demand, warranty related issues, or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures.

We rely on value-added and other resellers, as well as distribution partners, to sell our products, and disruptions to, or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products.

Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of value-added and other reseller and distribution partners, including our worldwide strategic partners such as Ericsson, IBM, and NSN. The majority of our revenues are derived through value-added resellers and distributors, most of which also sell our competitors’ products. Our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners. The loss of or reduction in sales to our value-added resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues. For example, in 2006, one of our largest resellers, Lucent, was acquired by Alcatel, a competitor of ours. As a result of the merger, Lucent became a competitor, their resale of our products declined, and we ultimately terminated our reseller agreement with Lucent. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products. If we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners, fail to develop new relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new markets, or expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets, fail to manage, train or motivate existing value-added resellers and distributors effectively, or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations would suffer.

In addition, we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sell-through model using information provided by our distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted.

Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage. For example, in 2009, we entered into an OEM agreement with IBM pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios. These types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement, maintain and manage. Our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products.

Our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or other partners, as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties. If our systems, the systems and processes of those third parties, or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail, our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted, and our financial results could be harmed.

Some of our business processes depend upon our information technology ("IT") systems, the systems, and processes of third parties, and on the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties. For example, our order entry system feeds information into the systems of our contract manufacturers, which enables them to build and ship our products. If those systems fail or are interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all. This could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business, and our financial results could be harmed. For example, although it did not adversely affect our shipments, an earthquake in late December of 2006 disrupted our communications with China, where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs.

We also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products. If those systems and processes experience interruption or delay, our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed. For example, as we have expanded our contract manufacturing base to China, we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturer was not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us. If we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed, our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed.



Telecommunications companies and our other large customers generally require more onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them. As we seek to sell more products to such customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues.

Telecommunications service provider companies and other large companies, because of their size, generally have greater purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received more favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions from us.

France Telecom-Orange and Deutsche Telekom AG have formed a company for the purpose of  purchasing products from, and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with, suppliers. As we seek to sell more products to this class of customer, we may be r

equired to agree to such terms and conditions, which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms.

For example, customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality and/or had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers. As a result, this class of customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we are required to agree to them, may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain, and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future.

During periods of high demand for electronic products, component shortages are possible, and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited. Any future growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner, and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. For example, from time to time, including the first quarter of 2008, we experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments. We currently purchase numerous key components, including ASICs, from single or limited sources. The development of alternate sources for those components is time-consuming, difficult, and costly. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. If we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver product to our customers, which would seriously affect present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, the development, licensing, or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business.

System security risks, data protection breaches, and cyber-attacks  could compromise our proprietary  information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our security products, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price.

In the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners on our networks.  The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.  Increasingly, companies, including Juniper Networks are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. Despite our security measures, Juniper Networks' information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers and hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.  Any such breach could compromise our networks, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products, and the information stored on our networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks.



If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our security products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers, many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded, to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques. This could impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. In addition, the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker, which are often difficult to identify.

Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects.

The traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the Internet telecommunications industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on IP networks, but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the Internet and Internet service provider access charges. We could be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service or content providers. Regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or content providers could adversely affect those customers' needs for products designed to enable a wide range of such services or business models. For instance, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has issued regulation

s governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks; these regulations might impact service provider and content provider business models and as such, providers' needs for Internet telecommunications equipment and services. In addition, many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security, privacy and data protection, which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment.

In addition, environmental regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations may impact our business and financial condition adversely. For instance, the European Union has adopted WEEE, ROHS and REACH regulations. In addition, some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards. Similar regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business.

The adoption and implementation of such regulations could decrease demand for our products, increase the cost of building and selling our products and impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner. Any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues.

The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring certification, notifications, review of source code, or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys. For example, Russia and China recently have implemented new requirements relating to products containing encryption and India has imposed special warranty and other obligations associated with technology deemed critical. Governmental regulation of encryption or IP networking technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues. In addition, failure to comply with such regulations could result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or government funded projects.

If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities, and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs and opportunities, or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all. If we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those needs in a timely manner, it could cause us to lose customers and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no



assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance.

For example, in connection with the acqui

sitions of Altor and Trapeze in 2010, we are now offering a virtualization security product and a WLAN product. Additionally, in 2011, we announced our new data center product, the QFabric™ solution, our mobility solutions with our MobileNext software and our Converged Supercore product, which converges the optical and packet layers of the network. If these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth, our ability to meet future financial targets may be

adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to achieve market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth, our ability to meet future financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the market in a timely manner, it could adversely affect the market acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position and our business and financial results.

Our ability to develop, market, and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive, engineering, sales and marketing, and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas, or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets, is limited and competition for such individuals is intense. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers and sales people, and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees, could delay the development and introduction of new products, and negatively impact our ability to market, sell, or support our products.

Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by: earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; expiration of, or lapses in, the R&D tax credit laws applicable to us; transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions, including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement; tax effects of share-based compensation; costs related to intercompany restructurings; or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial

condition, and results of operations.

From time to time, we receive preliminary notices of deficiency or notices of proposed adjustments from the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and possible penalties. For example, we received a preliminary notice of deficiency in 2011 and one in 2009 for prior tax years based on transfer pricing transactions related to the license of acquired intangibles under an intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement. As a result of the preliminary notices of deficiency received in 2011 and 2009, the incremental tax liability would be approximately $92.0 million and $807.0 million excluding interest and penalties, respectively. We believe the IRS' position with regard to these matters is inconsistent with applicable tax laws, judicial precedent and existing Treasury regulations, and that our previously reported income tax provisions for the years in question are appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in our favor. Regardless of whether these matters are resolved in our favor, the fin

al resolution of these matters could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and/or settle. While we believe we have provided adequately for these matters, there is a possibility that an adverse outcome of these matters individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which would harm our business.

We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers and the manufacturers order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts. If we overestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may assess charges, or we may have liabilities for excess inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. Conversely, because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms, and the demand for each component at a given time, if we underestimate our requirements, as we did in the third quarter of 2010 with respect to certain components, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time, materials, and/or components required to produce our products, which could increase costs or could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and



result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues.

We are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long-term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships.

We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of which is a third-party manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long-term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is time-consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them experiences delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations, or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management. Moreover, an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in China and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Upgrades to key internal systems and processes, and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with, and therefore harm, our business and operations.

We previously initiated a multi-year project to upgrade certain key internal systems and processes, including our company-wide human resources management system, our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system and enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. In the first quarter of 2010, we implemented a major upgrade of our CRM system. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes. Any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes, particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide service and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations, record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner, file SEC reports in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. Even if we do not encounter these adverse effects, the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned, or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more costly than anticipated, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

We are a party to lawsuits, proceedings, and other disputes, which are costly to defend and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay damages or prevent us from taking certain actions, any or all of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We, and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our Board of Directors, are subject to various lawsuits. We have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters, commercial transactions and patent infringement as well as securities laws, a description of the securities lawsuits can be found in Note 15,

Commitments and Contingencies,

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the heading “Legal Proceedings.” There can be no assurance that these or any actions that have been or may in the future be brought against us, our officers, and our directors will be resolved favorably or that tentative settlements will become final. Regardless of whether they are resolved, these lawsuits are, and any future lawsuits or threatened legal proceedings to which we, our officers, or our directors may become a party will likely be, expensive and time-consuming to defend, settle, and/or resolve. Legal proceedings, threatened legal proceedings or investigations, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation. Costs of defense, as well as any losses resulting from these claims or settlement of these claims, could significantly increase our expenses and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights, resolution of which may be time

-

consuming and expensive, as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute, defend, or make our products non-infringing.

Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, partners, or customers, alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they have been and can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, and may require us to develop non-infringing technologies or enter into license



agreements. Furthermore, because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third-party is successful, if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. In periods of market expansion, we have increased investment in our business by, for example, increasing headcount and increasing our investment in R&D, sales and marketing, and other parts of our business as we have in the 2010 fiscal year and in the first quarter of 2011. Conversely, during 2009, in response to downward trending industry and market conditions, we restructured our business, rebalanced our workforce, and reduced our real estate portfolio. Many of our expenses, such as real estate expenses, cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted because of fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees. Moreover, rapid changes in the size of our workforce could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives.

We are subject to risks arising from our international operations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations, and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and value-added resellers in c

ountries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the United States. In addition, a portion of our R&D and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the United States. In some countries, we may experience reduced intellectual property protection.

As a result of our international operations, we are affected by economic, regulatory, social, and political conditions in foreign countries, including changes in general IT spending, the imposition of government controls, including critical infrastructure protection, changes or limitations in trade protection laws, other regulatory requirements, which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries, service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws, natural disasters, epidemic disease, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions, misappropriation of intellectual property, military actions, acts of terrorism, political and social unrest and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. For example, revenue attributable to our customers in Japan generally accounts for five percent to eight percent of our revenue. Although we did not experience a significant negative impact to our revenue during fiscal year 2011, the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan may continue to adversely and unpredictably affect our customers and spending patterns in Japan in the short term. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for others t

o engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States regulations applicable to us. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, or agents could result in financial reporting problems, fines, penalties, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

The majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in U.S. Dollars. We also have some transactions that are denominated



in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the United States. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States in which we sell in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. However, no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances, including long-term declines in the value of the U.S. Dollar. If our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful, or if long-term declines in the value of the U.S. Dollar persist, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.

We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to enhance our business. For example, in December 2010 we acquired Altor and Trapeze, in July 2010 we acquired SMobile, and in April 2010 we acquired Ankeena. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs, diversion of management's attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, and potential loss of key employees. There can be no assu

rance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business. If we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources practices, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders, assume liabilities, record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.

If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process. We will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected.

Our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives.

We are required to test annually and review on an interim basis, our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, including the goodwill associated with past acquisitions and any future acquisitions, to determine if impairment has occurred. As of December 31, 2011, our goodwill was

$3,928.1 million

. If such assets are deemed impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. This would result in incremental expenses for that quarter, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred. For example, such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below certain levels for a sustained period, or if the portions of our business related to companies we have acquired fail to grow at expected rates or decline. In the second quarter of 2006, our impairment evaluation resulted in a reduction of $1,280.0 million to the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet for the SLT operating segment, primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately nine months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in forecasted future cash flows. In recent years, economic weakness contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that reduced the market price of many technology company stocks,



including ours. Future declines in our stock price, as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or gross margins, increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets.

Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors or do not meet customer quality expectations, our business could be adversely affected, and we may need to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services.

Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks, and, in the case of our security products, provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information. Our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors, defects, malware, or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by end-customers. Any errors, defects, malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, loss of future business and reputation, penalties, and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, in the event an error, defect, malware, or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a third-party vendor, we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention. If our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate, or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be harm

ed. Moreover, if our products fail to satisfy our customers' quality expectations for whatever reason, the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected.

If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our products do

not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation, and seriously harm our business and prospects.

Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology, and if licenses of third-party technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third-parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. The failure to comply with the terms of any license may result in our inability to continue to use such license. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements, could require us, if possible, to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and IP infrastructure, and if the demand for network and IP systems does not continue to grow, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure IP infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of IP services. As a result of changes in the economy capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand, all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers, spending on IP infrastructure can vary, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build out of their next generation networks. During the decision-making period when the customers are determining the design



of those networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks, such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure IP infrastructure. Such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers, can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and, even where our products are ultimately selected, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

While we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that, our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions may be adversely affected if our financial statements are not reliable and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.

The investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks, which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.

At December 31, 2011, we had

$2,910.4 million

in cash and cash equivalents and

$1,382.0 million

in short- and long-term investments. We have invested these amounts primarily in U.S. government securities, government-sponsored enterprise obligations, foreign government debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortg

age defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues at many financial institutions. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes.

In March

2011, we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate princi

ple amount of $1.0 billion. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the notes, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations, refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Based upon current levels of operations, we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, including the senior notes. However, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt (including the senior notes) or obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

The indenture that governs the senior notes also contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:

•

incur liens;

•

incur sale and leaseback transactions; and

•

consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person

As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business. A failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of an acceleration, we may not have or



be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments, including those under the senior notes.

Uninsured losses could harm our operating results.

We self-insure against many business risks and expenses, such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs, where we believe we can adequately self-insure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed cost-effective or is not available. We also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location, depending on availability, cost, and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles, policy limits, and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Properties

We lease approximately

2.5 million

square feet worldwide, with approximately


percent in North America. Our corporate headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California, and consists of buildings totaling approximately

1.1 million

square feet. Each building is subject to an individual lease or sublease, which provides various option, expansion, and extension provisions. The leases for our primary corporate headquarters buildings expire between January 2013 and November 2022. We also own approximately 80 acres of land adjacent to our leased corporate headquarters location. To support our growth in a cost-effective manner, we have begun a phased office campus build-out on land we own adjacent to our current headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. This will result in net facilities-related capital expenditures between $240 million and

$260 million

over the next 7 quarters. Additionally, we lease an approximately

0.2 million

square foot facility in Westford, Massachusetts, under leases that expire in March 2018.

In addition to our offices in Sunnyvale and Westford, we also lease offices in various locations throughout the United States, Canada, South America, EMEA, and APAC regions, including offices in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.

Our leases expire at various times through November 30, 2022. Our current offices are in good condition and appropriately support our business needs.

ITEM 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Report”), including the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future results of Juniper Networks, Inc. ("we," "us," or the “Company”) that are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about our business, our results of operations, the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “would,” “could,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the SEC, specifically our most recent reports on Form 10-Q. While forward-looking statements are based on reasonable expectations of our management at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of share-based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section included in this “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.



Business and Market Environment

At Juniper Networks, we

focus on architecting the new network. We design, develop, and sell products and services that together provide our customers with a high-performance network infrastructure built on simplicity, security, openness, and scale. We serve the high-performance networking requirements of global service providers, enterprises, governments, and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success. Our broad product portfolio spans routing, switching, security, application acceleration, identity policy and control, and network management to provide customers high performance, greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership.

We do business in three geographic regions: Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”), and our operations are organized into two reportable segments: Infrastructure and Service Layer Technologies (“SLT”). Our Infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used to control and direct network traffic from the core, through the edge, aggregation, and the customer premise equipment level, as well as a complete wireless local area network ("WLAN") solution that provides high reliability, performance, security, and management for mobile applications. Our SLT segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customers' priorities, from protecting the network itself and data on the network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed network. Both segments offer worldwide services, including technical support under maintenance contracts and professional services, as well as educational and training programs to our customers.

Over the past two years we have aligned our organization around a common vision for the new network. Together, our high-performance product and service offerings help our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation, value, and increased performance, reliability, and security to end-users. We remain dedicated to uncovering new ideas and innovations that will serve the exponential demands of the networked world and we will continue to build solutions that center on simplification, automation, and open innovation.

During 2011, we continued to experience a challenging macroeconomic environment. The effect of the increased macro volatility escalated especially over the second half of the year due to sovereign debt concerns in Europe as well as slow down of the economies in APAC and in the Americas. A number of our largest U.S. customers, including Tier 1 service providers and financial service firms, reduced their spend toward the end of the year. Additionally, our customers held off their core routing purchases in anticipation of the T4000 Series launch as we entered into a new product cycle. Despite the impact from the near-term challenges, our revenue grew in 2011. The investments we have made in R&D are delivering on a wave of new products, from our new offerings in the data center, QFabric, to enterprise mobility and to our Converged Supercore routing technology. The three core components of QFabric-the Node, Interconnect and Director were released; the next wave of MobileNext features including the S Gateway for mobile operators were announced during the year; our Converged Supercore solution, PTX Series switches, are expected to begin shipment in the first quarter of 2012; and the T4000 Core Router commenced shipment in the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, we have put the right organization structure in place to effectively drive our innovative portfolio and support our customers' next-generation network requirements.

In the coming year, we will remain focused on balancing the longer-term needs of the business while remaining agile and prudent with our spending in the short term. We believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remain healthy and we are focused on executing our strategy to address the market trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing. We believe our strategy aligns well with the driving forces of the Network. We believe innovation will drive long-term value creation in the networking industry, as customers forgo the complexity and unnecessary costs of old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across the multiple dimensions of network growth. With our strategy, our innovation pipeline, and the deeper penetration in both service provider and enterprise markets, we plan to navigate the challenging near-term environment in 2012 based on the following five operating principles:

•

Assume continued uncertainty in the near-term macro environment;

•

Grow faster than the markets we serve by focusing on new product introductions to accelerate growth as we exit 2012;

•

Maintain investments that deliver innovation and our product roadmap;

•

Focus on prudent cost management; and

•

Generate good cash flows to support our strategic needs and maintain a strong balance sheet.



Financial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview

The following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages):



•

Net Revenues:

Our net revenue increased across all three geographic regions and in both service provider and enterprise markets for year ended

December 31, 2011

, compared to the prior year. These increases were primarily driven by increases in revenue from routing and switching products as well as higher service revenue across both the Infrastructure and SLT segments, partially offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product revenue.

•

Gross Margin:

Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased for year ended

December 31, 2011

, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower product and service gross margin percentages and a higher proportion of service revenue for which gross margin is generally lower than product margin. Product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue declined due to a shift in geographic mix, increased overhead and increased inventory related costs. Service gross margin as a percentage of service revenue declined mainly due to the investment in resources to support our expanded product portfolio.

•

Operating Income:

Our operating income decreased as a percentage of revenues in the year ended

December 31, 2011

, compared to 2010, primarily due to slower revenue growth relative to the increase of investments in Sales and Marketing and Research and Development ("R&D") expenses as we continue to invest in our innovative portfolio and increase sales coverage for our new products. In addition, we recorded restructuring and other charges of

$30.6 million

in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily related to workforce reduction activities and asset impairments.

•

Net Income Attributable to Juniper Networks and Net Income Per Share Attributable to Juniper Networks Common Stockholders:

The decrease in net income attributable to Juniper Networks in the year ended

December 31, 2011

, compared to 2010, reflects the lower operating income discussed above as well as higher interest expense of

$49.5 million

primarily attributable to interest on our long-term debt issued in March 2011.

•

Operating Cash Flows:

Operating cash flows in December 31, 2011 increased compared to 2010. Operating cash flows in the prior year included a $169.3 million litigation settlement payment.

•

Deferred Revenue:

Total deferred revenue increased

$82.6 million

to

$967.0 million

as of

December 31, 2011

, compared to

$884.4 million

as of

December 31, 2010

, due to an increase in deferred service revenue driven by product sales and renewals, slightly offset by a small decrease i

n deferred product revenue. Total deferred service revenue increased

$86.1 million

compared to

December 31, 2010

, primarily due to an increase in new service contracts and renewal of existing contracts. Deferred gross product revenue as of

December 31, 2011

, decreased

$15.4 million

compared to

December 31, 2010

, primarily due to the release of approximately $62.7 million from various product commitments made as of December 31, 2010 and delivered during 2011, partially offset by new product commitments and other deferrals.



•

DSO

: DSO as of December 31, 2011 was relatively flat compared to the prior year. DSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days.

•

Book-to-Bill

: Book-to-bill was one for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, and greater than one for the quarter ended

December 31, 2010

. Book-to-bill represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period. Product orders exclude certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals, sales return reserves, and service revenue allocations, and early payment discounts.

•

Stock Repurchase Plan Activity:

Under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased approximately

17.5 million

shares of our common stock at an average price of

$30.93

per share for an aggregate purchase price of

$541.2 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2011

.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operations may be affected.

•

Revenue recognition.

Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. Changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.

Under our revenue recognition policies, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, or estimated selling price (“ESP”) if neither VSOE nor Third Party Evidence ("TPE") is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. ESP is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles. When determining ESP, we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles. We do not use TPE as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors' products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years. We apply ESP to the majority of our product revenue and VSOE to our service revenue in 2011 and 2010.

•

Contract Manufacturer Liabilities.

We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers, and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and they procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are our estimates of future demand for our products, based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish a provision for inventory, carrying costs, and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends. Significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand, inventory carrying costs, and obsolete material exposures. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we may incur charges for excess



components, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our contract manufacturer liabilities were

$14.8 million

and

$22.7 million

, respectively.

•

Warranty Reserves.

We generally offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90-day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, labor costs for trouble-shooting and repair, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, if actual product failure rates, use of materials, or service delivery costs differ from estimates, additional warranty costs may be incurred, which could reduce gross margin. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our warranty reserves were

$28.3 million

and

$35.9 million

, respectively.

•

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets.

We make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: (a) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; (b) a substantial decline in our market capitalization, (c) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (d) unanticipated competition; (e) loss of key personnel; (f) a more likely-than-not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof; (g) a realignment of our resources or restructuring of our existing businesses in response to changes to industry and market conditions; (h) testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; or (i) higher discount rate used in the impairment analysis as impacted by an increase in interest rates.

We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of November 1

st

or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment level, by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of forecasted future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting units to values of publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business. If the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. When the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or a indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, operating trends, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocated shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. As of

December 31, 2011

, Goodwill recorded for our SLT segment and Infrastructure segment was

$2,282.6 million

and

$1,645.5 million

, respectively. A

hypothetical decrease of 5% in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would result in excess fair value over carrying value of approximately nil for our SLT segment to $7.3 billion for our Infrastructure segment.

We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the



underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the i

mpairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

•

Share-Based Compensation.

We recognize share-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards including employee stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance share awards ("PSAs"), and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") based on each award's fair value on the grant date.

We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options and ESPP. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected award life, and risk-free interest rate. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options. The expected life of an award is based on historical experience, the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees, and the potential effect from options that have not been exercised. We determ

ine the fair value of RSUs and PSAs based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. In addition, we use significant judgment in estimating share-based compensation expense for our PSAs based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set.

The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Additionally, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as judgment and recognize expense only for those expected-to-vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded share-based compensation expense could be different.

•

Income Taxes.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates may differ from the statutory rate due to factors such as, but not limited to, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, tax audit settlements, changes in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets, non-deductible compensation, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 25.7%, 20.4%, and 63.1% for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as t

he closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties, if applicable.

Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized through the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and future income, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. In the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance is reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with



a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

•

Loss Contingencies.

We use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood

of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. For a discussion of current litigation, please see under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in Note 15,

Our net product revenue increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in sales of our Infrastructure routing products, particularly the MX Series routers, to service provider and enterprise customers across all regions, reflecting our competitive position and customers' demand for our edge products. Our switching products, including EX Series, QFabric and WLAN products, increased due to strength in our EX Series products, both in data center and campus deployments. We also recorded initial revenues from the first deployment of our QFabric solution. The increase in Infrastructure revenue was partially offset by the decline in revenue from the M and T Series routers primarily attributable to weaker overall demand from service providers driven by uncertain macroeconomic environment as well as an expected pause as we introduce the T4000 router. SLT product revenue also had a slight decrease in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily attributed to the decline in our high-end product lines influenced by the timing of our high-end SRX service provider deployments and the transition from older enterprise security products to our new security product portfolio. Service revenue increased in 2011, primarily attributable to sales of our MX Series routers and EX Series switches,

primarily attributable to sales and contract renewals for our MX Series routers, EX Series switches and High-End SRX products.

Our net product revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in Infrastructure product sales to service provider and enterprise customers across all regions, SLT product sales to enterprise customers across all regions and



SLT product sales to service provider customers in the Americas. The increased revenue was the result of increased demand for our most recent product lines, the MX Series routers, EX Series switches, and SRX service gateways, as well as the improved macroeconomic environment as compared to 2009. Additionally our net service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in sales to enterprise customers across all regions and to service provider customers in the EMEA and APAC regions, which was primarily driven by growth in the installed base and continued strength in contract renewals for support services.

Net Revenues by Market and Customer

The following table presents the total net revenues by market (in millions, except percentages):

We sell our high-performance network products and service offerings from our Infrastructure and SLT segments to two primary markets – service provider and enterprise. Determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customer's industrial classification code, but may also include judgmental factors such as the intended use of the product. The service provider market generally includes wireline, wireless, and cable operators, as well as major Internet content and application providers, including those that provide social networking and search engine services. The enterprise market generally comprises businesses; federal, state, and local governments; and research and education institutions.

Net revenue increased in 2011 attributable to the increase in sales to the service provider market across all three geographic regions, specifically in the Americas and EMEA regions. The increase was largely attributable to customers' adoption of our Infrastructure products, including the MX Series routers, EX Series switches and WLAN products, across all three regions, slightly offset by a decline in the SLT products in the Americas.

Net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in absolute dollars in 2010 compared 2009, primarily due to our customers’ increased investment in new network build-outs and purchases of additional networking capacity to support network growth.

Revenues from sales to the enterprise market also increased in 2011, compared to


, reflecting demand for routing and switching products including the MX Series routers, EX Series switches, and WLAN products driven by the value proposition we offer to customers as well as our strategy of expanding presence in the enterprise market. The increase in enterprise revenues in 2011, was experienced across all three geographic regions. Net revenues from sales to the enterprise market increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to our expanded portfolio of products and our continued investments to expand our footprint in the enterprise market.

No customers accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. Verizon Communications, Inc., accounted for 10.6% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. AT&T, Inc., accounted for 10.4% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Net Revenues by Geographic Region

The following table presents the total net revenues by geographic region (in millions, except percentages):



Net revenues in the Americas increased in absolute dollars during 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to increased sales in the United States attributable to the demand for our routing and switching products and services from enterprise and service provider customers. Net revenues in the Americas decreased as a percentage of total revenue from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to the relative strength in EMEA.

Net revenues in the Americas region increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased demand in the United States. In the United States, net revenues increased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of total net revenues, in 2010 compared to 2009, due to the relative strength of the enterprise and service provider markets in the United States.

Net revenues in EMEA increased, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues, in 2011, compared to 2010, driven by service provider and enterprise demand for our routing and switching products and related services, in both service provider and enterprise markets. The increases were largely attributable to Sweden, Eastern Europe, and the Netherlands. In addition, we initiated the first revenue from a top service provider in Eastern Europe spanning a broad range of our product portfolio.

Net revenues in EMEA increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased demand in Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This increase was largely driven by product sales to both the enterprise and service provider markets.

Net revenues in APAC increased in 2011, compared to 2010, due to the increase in revenues from our routing, switching, and SLT products and services, in both service provider and enterprise markets.  Revenue increased in Southeast Asia and Australia, partially offset by continued weakness in Japan and push out of some demand in China. Net revenues as a percentage of total revenues remain relatively flat in 2011 compared to 2010.

Net revenues in APAC increased in absolute dollars in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased demand in Japan, China, and Australia. This increase was primarily driven by product sales to enterprise customers and service sales to service provider customers.

Gross Margins

The following table presents gross margins (in millions, except percentages):



Product gross margin percentage decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to a lower proportion of router revenue, a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from Americas, increased fixed overhead and inventory-related costs. As of December 31, 2011, and 2010, we had


and


employees, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our independent contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, orchestrate new product introductions, and monitor and manage product testing and quality.

Product gross margin and product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in 2010 compared to 2009 increased primarily due to a change in product mix that favored higher margin products and our continued efforts to manage costs.

Service gross margin increased in absolute dollars in 2011, compared to 2010, mainly attributed to the 16% growth in service revenue. Service gross margin percentage decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to a growth in headcount of

21%

to

1,289

employees as of December 31, 2011, compared to

1,064

employees as of December 31, 2010.The higher headcount was due to the increase both service and support resources for our expanded product portfolio.

Service gross margin increased in 2010 compared to 2009 in absolute dollars primarily due to increased service revenues, and service gross margin as a percentage of service revenues decreased primarily due to a shift in mix that was driven by an increase in value-added service related revenue.

Operating Expenses

The following table presents operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

Personnel-related costs, including wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits, share-based compensation, and travel, have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses, and we expect this trend to continue. Facility and information technology (“IT”) departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount. Facility and IT related headcount was


,


, and


as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We had

9,129

,

8,772

, and

7,231

employees as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The year-over-year increase in 2011 was due to growth across all of our organizations as a result of our efforts to grow the business.

R&D expenses increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses of $75.7 million. Also contributing to the increase was higher consulting, facilities and IT costs associated with our R&D projects to support our new product initiatives including the data center, mobility,and core solutions. This increase was partially offset by lower variable compensation in 2011. Our R&D headcount was relatively flat at 4,138 as of December 31, 2011, compared to the prior year, as a result of our restructuring activities in the second half of 2011.

R&D expenses increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to additional headcount and strategic initiatives to expand



our product portfolio. In particular, we focused on delivering optical capabilities and a packet-optimized transport system that will help service providers better support packet and IP-based services, such as video, mobility and cloud computing. Personnel-related costs increased $111.6 million in 2010, primarily due to a 25% increase in headcount in our engineering organization, from 3,308 to 4,132 employees, to support product innovation intended to capture anticipated future network infrastructure growth and opportunities. Additionally, our outside consulting, facilities, and IT costs related to R&D expenses increased to support our R&D efforts.

Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2011, compared to


, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses of $128.5 million. Additionally, contributing to the increase in 2011 was an increase in commission expense driven by higher revenue and an increase in outside services incurred to support our sales and marketing activities. As a result of our restructuring activities in the second half of 2011, sales and marketing headcount increased only

4%

from

2,466

employees as of December 31, 2010 to

2,568

employees as of December 31, 2011.

Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to our 2010 advertising campaign, events for new product launches, and an increase in personnel-related costs of $95.8 million. The increase in personnel-related costs was primarily due to a 17% increase in our sales and marketing headcount from 2,101 to 2,466 employees, an increase in variable compensation driven by growth in our revenues, and an increase in outside services to support our sales and marketing programs. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in 2010 due to our focus on managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales activities.

General and administrative ("G&A") expense was relatively flat in 2011, compared to 2010, as costs associated with the G&A headcount growth of

3%

from


at December 31, 2010 to


at December 31, 2011, were largely offset by lower variable compensation.

G&A expenses increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, G&A expenses decreased slightly in 2010 due to our continued focus on managing expenses. Personnel-related costs increased $25.0 million in 2010, primarily due to a 14% increase in headcount, from 393 to 449 employees in our worldwide G&A functions to support expected future growth of the business, as well as higher variable compensation driven by growth in revenues. Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to our G&A infrastructure increased to support our growing business.

Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in, 2011, compared to 2010, due to the addition of intangible assets from acquisitions during 2011 and 2010. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to certain purchased intangible assets reaching the end of their amortization period during 2009. We had no impairment of our goodwill or our purchased intangible assets in 2011 and 2010.

We incurred

$30.6 million

of net restructuring and other charges in 2011 primarily related to a restructuring plan (the "2011 Restructuring Plan") implemented in the third quarter of 2011 to align our business operations with macroeconomic and other market conditions. Restructuring charges of $17.1 million was primarily related to workforce reductions. Remaining liabilities in the 2011 Restructuring Plan, are expected to be paid out in the first half of 2012. As we complete the alignment over the next two quarters, we may incur additional severance and facility costs. Such costs, primarily facility related, may range from $14 million to $21 million. Included in other charges, was a $13.5 million charge related to the impairment of an abandoned in-process internal use software project.

In 2010 and 2009, we recorded $10.8 million and $19.5 million, respectively, as a result of a restructuring plan to reduce our real estate portfolio and workforce in targeted areas of the Company. As of December 31, 2011, the 2009 Restructuring Plan was complete. See Note 9,

Other Financial Information

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information regarding our restructuring liabilities.

In 2011 and  2010, we recorded

$7.1 million

and $6.3 million, respectively, in direct and indirect acquisition-related costs such as financial advisory, legal, due diligence, and integration costs from acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010.

In 2009, we recorded litigation settlement charges of $182.3 million, which included $169.0 million related to our agreement in principle reached in February 2010, to settle the securities class action litigation pending against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors, $13.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute in connection with certain real estate in Sunnyvale California purchased in 2000 and $0.3 million related to another settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Of these amounts, $181.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. See Note 15,

Commitments and Contingencies

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information. No such charges were incurred in 2010 and 2011.



Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense associated with stock options, employee stock purchases, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and performance share awards ("PSAs") was recorded in the following cost and expense categories (in millions, except percentages):

Share-based compensation expense increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to the increase in award grants driven by headcount growth and higher fair value of equity awards attributable to the increase in the market value of our common stock for those awards. Share-based compensation expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in RSU and PSA grants during the period primarily resulting from an increase in the number of participants.

Other Income and Expense, Net and Income Tax Provision

The following table presents other income and expense, net and income tax provision (in millions, except percentages):

Interest income primarily includes interest income from our cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Interest expense increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to the $37.7 million interest expense on the debt issued in March 2011. Other typically consists of investment and foreign exchange gains and losses and other non-operational income and expense items. In 2011, other included certain legal expenses unrelated to current or recent operations of approximately

$7.0 million

. In 2010, we recognized a total gain of $8.7 million, primarily due to acquisitions of our privately-held equity investments in Ankeena and Altor.  During 2009 we recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million on our equity investments for changes in fair value that we believed were other-than-temporary.

Our effective tax rates were

25.7%

, 20.4%, and 63.1% in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The effective rate for 2011 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the federal R&D credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for 2011 differed from 2010 as a result of the items referenced below, which were recognized in 2010.

The decrease in overall rate in 2010 compared to 2009, and the federal statutory rate of 35%, was primarily due to the federal R&D credit, the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates, and a $54.1 million income tax benefit in 2010 resulting from a change in the Company's estimate of unrecognized tax benefits due to the taxpayer favorable ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Court”) in

Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner

related to share-based compensation.

The effective tax rate in 2009 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following income tax charges: (i) a $61.8 million discrete and other related charge that resulted from changes in California income tax laws that were enacted during 2009; (ii) a $52.1 million charge that resulted from a change in our unrecognized tax benefits related to share-



based compensation; and (iii) a $4.6 million charge which related to an investigation by the India tax authorities. The effective rate impact from these charges was partially offset by the federal R&D credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates.

For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of

35%

and further explanation of our income tax provision, see Note 14,

Select segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, is as follows (in millions, except percentages and units):

Infrastructure

_______________________________

(1)

Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Excludes modular and fixed configuration EX Series Ethernet switching products, circuit-to-packet products, and timing servers.

A reconciliation of total segment operating income to income before taxes and noncontrolling interest can be found in Note 13,

Segments,

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

In 2011, Infrastructure products revenue increased across all three regions in both the service provider and enterprise markets. These increases were primarily from sales of our routing and switching products such as MX Series routers, EX Series switches and WLAN. The increase in Infrastructure service revenue in 2011, was primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services and increased installed base from our Infrastructure product sales.

Infrastructure operating income decreased as a percent of Infrastructure revenue in 2011, compared to 2010, was largely due to the decline in product margins and higher operating expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation in 2011.

We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Most of our Infrastructure product platforms are modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units



represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. Infrastructure chassis revenue units  increased in 2011, compared to


, primarily due to the increase in shipments of our MX Series routers, particularly the mid-range MX product lines.  The increase in shipments of the mid-range MX product lines, which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis, drove the higher number of ports shipped in 2011, compare to 2010.

In 2010, Infrastructure products revenue experienced growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions compared to 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our MX Series routers and EX Series switches.  The increased demand for our products was primarily due to growing network demand attributable to increased reliance on digital devices connected to the network, and to a lesser extent, the improved macroeconomic environment.

Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which was commensurate with Infrastructure product revenue growth during the year. Infrastructure port shipments increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the continued growth in sales of MX Series products, which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis.

A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers that purchase our products and enter into support services contracts for support. Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which was primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales and strong contract renewals for support services. From a geographical and market perspective, the increase in Infrastructure service revenues was primarily due to an increase in enterprise business across all regions and service provider business in the EMEA and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in service revenue in the Americas service provider market.

Infrastructure operating income increased as a percent of Infrastructure revenue in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage, which was attributable to changes in product mix that favored higher margin products.  Additionally, although Infrastructure sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers, they decreased as a percentage of Infrastructure revenues.

SLT

_______________________________

A reconciliation of total segment operating income to income before taxes and noncontrolling interest can be found in Note 13,

Segments,

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

SLT product revenues decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, which was largely driven by a decrease in revenue from our High-End SRX, High-End Firewall and Branch Firewall products, partially offset by an increase in our Branch SRX revenue. The decline was primarily experienced in the Americas service provider market. Although SLT product revenue decreased in 2011, revenue units increased due to the higher sales of our lower priced branch products.

The increase in SLT service revenue in 2011, compared to 2010, was primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services in both the service provider and enterprise markets across all regions.

SLT operating income decreased as a percent of revenue in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to decline in revenue and shift to lower margin products.



We experienced an increase in SLT product revenue in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased demand for our branch and high-end SRX service gateway products. From a geographical and market perspective, we experienced revenue growth in the Americas service provider market and across all regions in the enterprise market in 2010.

SLT revenue units increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which was commensurate with growth in SLT product revenue. The percentage increase in SLT revenue units was less than the increase in SLT product revenues due to a product mix that favored higher average selling prices.

The increase in SLT service revenue in 2010 compared to 2009, was primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales and strong contract renewals for support services. From a geographical and market perspective, the increase in SLT service revenues was due to growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions.

SLT operating income increased as a percent of revenue in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of SLT revenue as we continued our efforts to carefully manage costs. Additionally, the increase was attributable to higher gross margin percentage resulting from changes in product mix and efficiencies achieved from the higher 2010 revenues.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and the issuance of our common stock, and more recently, the issuance of long-term debt. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions, except percentages and days sales outstanding):

________________________________

N/M - Not meaningful

The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and short-term deferred revenue. Working capital increased by

$1,230.6 million

in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to a higher cash and cash equivalent balance as a result of our $1.0 billion debt offering in March 2011.

Summary of Cash Flows

As of

December 31, 2011

, our cash and cash equivalents increased by

$1,098.5 million

from

December 31, 2010

. This increase was mainly the result of cash generated by our operating and financing activities of

$986.7 million

and

$819.0 million

, respectively, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of

$707.2 million

.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was

$986.7 million

,

$812.3 million

, and

$796.1 million

, for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Cash flows from operations increased by $

174.4 million

in 2011, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the one-time litigation settlement payment of

$169.3 million

in 2010 which did not occur in 2011. The increase was partially offset by lower consolidated net income in 2011. For 2010, operating cash flows increased by $16.2 million from 2009, primarily due to higher consolidated net income, partially offset by litigation settlement payments, prepaid taxes, and higher accounts



receivable.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was

$707.2 million

,

$532.8 million

, and

$948.3 million

, in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. During 2011, we invested the proceeds from our March 2011 debt offering in available-for-sale securities and purchased property and equipment for the build-out of our new headquarter campus in Sunnyvale, CA. The change in net cash used in investing activities from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to net cash paid for acquisitions in 2010.

Financing Activities

Net cash generated in financing activities was

$819.0 million

in 2011, and net cash used were

$72.4 million

, and

$262.2 million

for 2010, and 2009, respectively. We generated additional cash from financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the issuance of our long-term debt on March 5, 2011, partially offset by the repurchase of our outstanding common stock. For further discussion of our long-term debt, see Note 10,

Financing

, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In 2010, we used additional cash in financing activities to repurchase our outstanding common stock through our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by cash proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees as a result of higher stock prices.

Stock Repurchase Activities

In February 2010, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a stock repurchase program (the “2010 Stock Repurchase Program”), which authorized us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. This authorization was in addition to the stock repurchase program approved by the Board in March 2008 (the “2008 Stock Repurchase Program”), which also enabled us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock.

We repurchased and retired approximately

17.5 million

shares of our common stock at an average price of

$30.93

per share for an aggregate purchase price of

$541.2 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2011

, under our 2010 Stock Repurchase Program. As of

December 31, 2011

, there were

no

remaining authorized funds under the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program and

$213.8 million

remaining authorized funds under the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011, and 2010.

Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, tax liabilities, and other contractual obligations. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions):

________________________________

(1)

Our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our non-cancelable operating leases. Rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We occupy approximately

2.5 million

square feet worldwide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires on

November 30, 2022

.

(2)

In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, our contract manufacturers place non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders for components based on our build forecasts. The contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts



and on purchase orders we have received from our customers. Generally, we do not own the components and title to the product transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders. As of

December 31, 2011

, we had accrued

$14.8 million

based on our estimate of such charges. Total purchase commitments as of

December 31, 2011

, consisted of

$150.6 million

of NCNR orders.

(3)

Tax liabilities include

$108.5 million

of long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

(4)

In March 2011, we issued

$300.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.10%

senior notes due


(the "2016 notes"),

$300.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.60%

senior notes due


(the "2021 notes"), and

$400.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

5.95%

senior notes due


(the "2041 notes" and, together with the 2016 notes and the 2021 notes the "notes"). Interest on the notes is payable in cash semiannually. We may redeem the notes, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, subject to a make-whole premium, and, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of the notes at a purchase price equal to

101%

of the aggregate principle amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture that governs the notes also contains various covenants, including limitations on the our ability to incur liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions over certain dollar thresholds.

(5)    O

ther contractual obligations primarily consisted of

$25.1 million

in indemnity-related and service related escrows, required by certain acquisitions completed in 2005, 2010 and 2011,

$30.7 million

in campus build-out obligations, and other miscellaneous commitments.

Guarantees

We have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. We also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, customs and duties guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. As of

December 31, 2011

, and 2010, we had

$19.9 million

and

$21.6 million

, respectively, in bank guarantees and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees.

Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements

Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future. Additionally, if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program, our liquidity may be impacted. As of

December 31, 2011

, 49% of our cash and investment balances are held outside of the U.S., which may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated.

In August 2010, we filed a $1.5 billion shelf registration with the SEC. In March 2011, we issued notes in the amount of $1.0 billion under the shelf registration statement. Therefore, while we have no current plans to do so, we may issue up to $500 million in additional securities under the shelf registration statement. The shelf registration is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions. Any additional offerings of securities under the shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus.

We have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant. Our intention for fiscal year 2011 was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at less than three percent (3%) of our common stock outstanding. Based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options, RSUs, and PSAs (counting only the on-target measure of such PSA

s), we achieved the goal for 2011. We have also managed our equity compensation programs to reduce the overall number of shares subject to outstanding awards over the past two years. The total number of common shares subject to our outstanding option, RSU, and PSA awards was 58.2 million, 63.5 million, and 76.5 million shares as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, reflecting a consecutive decline for the three years ended December 31, 2011.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments (which includes the proceeds of the issuance of the notes), together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next 12 months. We believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including:

•

level and mix of our product, sales, and gross profit margins;

•

our business, product, capital expenditures and R&D plans;

•

repurchases of our common stock;

•

incurrence and repayment of debt and related interest obligations;



•

litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar items related to resolution of tax audits;

•

volume price discounts and customer rebates;

•

accounts receivable levels that we maintain;

•

acquisitions and/or funding of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies;

•

changes in our compensation policies;

•

capital improvements for new and existing facilities;

•

technological advances;

•

our competitors' responses to our products and/or pricing;

•

our relationships with supplies, partners, and customers;

•

possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories;

•

expenses related to future restructuring plans, if any;

•

tax expense associated with share-based awards;

•

issuance of share-based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years;

•

level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and

•

general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. The value of our investments is subject to market price volatility. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, 49% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held in non-U.S. domiciled countries. Our marketable securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. We recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, related to the sales of our investments.

The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2011, and 2010, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions):



These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less.

Our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Approximately 76% of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and/or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by non-U.S. Dollar denominated operating expense and costs. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates. We record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1%, 1%, and 2% in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly changes by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would change by less than 1%, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.

Equity Price Risk

Our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities and our non-qualified deferred compensation (“NQDC”) plan, which may



also hold publicly-traded equity securities, are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. Our publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments under the NQDC plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not purchase our publicly-traded equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2011, and 2010, the total investments under the NQDC plan were

$9.3 million

and $8.1 million, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change on the total investments under the NQDC plan as of December 31, 2011, and 2010 would result in an immaterial loss.

We have also invested in privately-held companies. These investments are carried at cost. In 2011, there were impairment charge of

$1.8 million

on our investments in privately-held companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in Note 5,

Fair Value Measurements

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There were no such charges in 2010. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately-held companies was

$51.8 million

and $22.1 million as of December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited Juniper Networks, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Juniper Networks, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. as of December 31, 2011, and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, of Juniper Networks, Inc. and our report dated February 24, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework.

Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company's consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report preceding this report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation

Description of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc (the “Company” or “Juniper”) designs, develops, and sells products and services that together provide customers with a high-performance network infrastructure built on simplicity, security, openness, and scale. The Company serves the high-performance networking requirements of global service providers, enterprises, governments, and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements, which include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

As of

December 31, 2011

, the Company owned a

60 percent

interest in a joint venture with Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. (“NSN”). Given the Company's majority ownership interest in the joint venture, the accounts of the joint venture have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the noncontrolling investor's interests in the net assets and operations of the joint venture. In July 2011, NSN and the Company entered into an agreement to cease operation of and terminate the joint venture and subsequently NSN has assumed the activities of the joint venture. The Company is in the process of winding down this joint venture and the termination of this joint venture is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Foreign Currency Translations

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations with non-U.S. Dollar functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars using average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency translation gains and losses were

not material

for the years ended December 31, 2011,  2010 and 2009.

Reclassifications

In the first quarter of 2010, the Company reclassified certain selling and marketing costs that were previously reported as cost of service revenues as sales and marketing expense. Accordingly,

$25.1 million

of costs reported in the year ended December 31, 2009, have been reclassified from cost of service revenues to sales and marketing expense to conform to the current period's presentation. The reclassification did not impact the Company's previously reported net revenues, segment results, operating income, net income, or earnings per share.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operation may be affected.

Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it transacts, and considers assumptions that market participants would use



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. These inputs are valued using market based approaches.

Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions. These inputs, if any, are valued using internal financial models.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, highly liquid investments in money market funds, commercial paper, government securities, certificates of deposit, and corporate debt securities, which are readily convertible into cash.

Investments in Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities

Investments with stated maturities of greater than three months are classified as short-term or long-term investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date.

The Company's investments in publicly-traded debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at cost and periodically adjusted to fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company recognizes an impairment charge for available-for-sale investments when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is determined to be other than temporary. The Company considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time the investment has been in a loss position, the extent to which the fair value has been less than the Company's cost basis, the investment's financial condition, and near-term prospects of the investee. If the Company determines that the decline in an investment's fair value is other than temporary, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss in its consolidated statements of operations.

The Company's non-qualified compensation plan, which invests in mutual funds are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The realized and unrealized holding gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations.

Privately-Held Investments

The Company has investments in privately-held companies. These investments are included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets and are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as the Company does not have a controlling interest and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. These investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be significant. The Company measures the fair value of privately-held investments using an analysis of the financial conditions and near term prospects of the investees, including recent financing activities and their capital structure. Realized gains and losses, if any, are reported in the consolidated statements of operations.

Derivatives



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its market exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other (expense) income, net. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such derivatives are classified as operating activities. These foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of

one

year or less.

The Company also uses foreign currency forward or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of

less than one year

. These derivatives are carried at fair value and the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the operating expense line item to which the hedged transaction relates. The Company records any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during 2011, 2010, and 2009, in other (expense) income, net, on its consolidated statements of operations. Cash flows from such hedges are classified as operating activities.

Concentrations

Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. The Company invests only in high-quality credit instruments and maintains its cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments in fixed income securities, and money market funds with several high-quality institutions. Deposits held with banks, including those held in foreign branches of global banks, may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk.

Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across different geographic locations throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Company maintains reserves for potential bad debt and historically such losses have been within management's expectations.

No

single customer

accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total net revenues for 2011.

Verizon Communications, Inc.

, and

AT&T, Inc.

, accounted for

10.6%

, and

10.4%

of the Company's total net revenues for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company relies on sole suppliers for certain of its components such as ASICs and custom sheet metal. Additionally, the Company relies primarily on a limited number of significant independent contract manufacturers for the production of all of its products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could negatively impact future operating results.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of

one and half

years to

five

years for computers, equipment and software,

five

years for furniture and fixtures,

seven

to

forty

years for building and building improvements, and

ten

to

forty

years for land improvements. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over lease term, for a maximum of

ten

years. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for their intended use.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill represents the purchase price over estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter. Such goodwill and other intangible assets may also be tested for impairment between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as, but not limited to:  (a) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; (b) a substantial decline in our market capitalization, (c) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (d) unanticipated competition; (e) loss of key personnel; (f) a

more likely-than-not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof; (g) a realignment of our resources or restructuring of our existing businesses in response to changes to industry and market conditions; (h) testing for



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; or (i) higher discount rate used in the impairment analysis as impacted by an increase in interest rates.

The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis at its reporting unit level, which is one level below its operating segment level during the fourth quarter of each year. The fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. In the application of the income and market valuation approaches, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates.

Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business, difficulties or delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of an acquired business. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. An impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

The Company amortizes intangible assets with estimable useful lives on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.

The Company generally relies upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.

•

Delivery has occurred.

The Company uses shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance.

•

Sales price is fixed or determinable.

The Company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.

•

Collectability is reasonably assured.

The Company assesses collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by our credit checks and their payment histories. The Company records accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns, and pricing credits.

In 2010, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2009-13, Topic 605 -

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

(“ASU 2009-13”). ASU 2009-13 changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price. Concurrently with issuing ASU 2009-13, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2009-14, Topic 985 -

Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements

(“ASU 2009-14”). ASU 2009-14 excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software component and the non-software component function together to deliver the tangible products' essential functionality. The Company applied these two standards for new and materially modified arrangements originating after December 31, 2009.

When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements and software and non-software components function together to deliver the tangible products' essential functionality, the Company allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third-party evidence (“TPE”) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (“ESP”) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition. VSOE of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. In determining VSOE, the Company requires that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

trends for specific products and services. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. However, as the Company's products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and its solutions offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as the Company is unable to reliably determine what competitors products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, the Company is not typically able to determine TPE. The ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles.

In multiple element arrangements where software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.

The Company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer-specific return or refund privileges. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value and there are no customer-negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements. If the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered item, and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In circumstances when the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements, and the allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition is determined for the combined unit as a single unit. Allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit's relative selling price. The new standards do not generally change the units of accounting for the Company's revenue transactions.

Prior to 2010, and for current software sales, the Company allocated revenue to each element using the residual method when the VSOE of fair value of the undelivered items for arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include services and software, exists. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. If VSOE of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of: (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period.

The Company accounts for multiple agreements with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement. For sales to direct end-users, value-added resellers, and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") partners, the Company recognizes product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is the Company's practice to identify an end-user prior to shipment to a value-added reseller. For the Company's end-users and value-added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return. The Company's agreements with its OEM partners may allow future rights of returns or pricing credits. A portion of the Company's sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return. Product revenue on sales made through these distributors is recognized upon sell-through as reported by the distributors to the Company. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell-through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria outlined in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time.

Service revenues include revenue from maintenance, training, and professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally

one to three years

. Revenue from training and professional services is recognized as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is generally

one year or less

.

The Company sells certain interests in accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis as part of customer financing arrangements



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

primarily with one major financing company. Cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as a secured borrowing within other current liabilities.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company's assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews its receivables that remain outstanding past their applicable payment terms and establishes allowance and potential write-offs by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.

Warranty Reserves

The Company generally offers a

one

-year warranty on all of its hardware products and a


-day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. Warranty costs are accrued as part of the Company's cost of sales based on associated material costs, labor costs, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material costs are estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Labor and overhead costs are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support customer cases within the warranty period.

Contract Manufacturer Liabilities

The Company outsources most of its manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to its independent contract manufacturers, and a significant portion of its cost of revenues consists of payments to them. The independent contract manufacturers produce the Company's products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards established by the Company, and they procure components and manufacture the products based on the Company's demand forecasts. These forecasts are the Company's estimates of future demand for its products, based upon historical trends and analysis from the Company's sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. The Company establishes a provision for inventory, carrying costs, and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends.

Research and Development

Costs to research, design, and develop the Company's products are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. Generally, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. As a result, costs incurred between achieving technological feasibility and product general availability have not been significant, and all software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Advertising expense was

$17.2 million

,

$17.1 million

, and

$11.4 million

, for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Loss Contingencies

The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Management considers the likelihood of loss related to an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company records a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model in order to estimate  the fair value of its share-



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

based payment awards on the date of grant. Share-base compensation expense for expected-to-vest share-based awards is valued under the single-option approach and and amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, and RSUs and PSAs are amortized on a ratable basis, net of estimated forfeitures. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.

The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions that represents management's best estimates of volatility, expected option life, and risk-free interest rate. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options. The expected life of an award is based on historical experience, the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees, as well as the potential effect from options that have not been exercised at the time.

Provision for Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that the Company believes any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized through the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and future income, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets. In the event the Company determines that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes and measures potential liabilities based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company includes the components of comprehensive income (loss) as part of its consolidated statements of changes in equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are excluded from net income, and net foreign currency translations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2011-04, Topic 820 -

Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs

(“ASU 2011-04”), which amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to converge with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and provides increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application by public companies is not permitted. The Company's adoption of ASU 2011-04 will not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Topic 220 -

Presentation of Comprehensive

Income

(“ASU 2011-05”), which requires an entity to present total comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company's adoption of ASU 2011-05 will not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Topic 350 -

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

("ASU 2011-08"), which amends Topic 350 to allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. This guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill tests performed for years beginning after December 15,



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company's adoption of ASU 2011-08 is not expected to have an impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-12, Topic 220 -

Comprehensive Income

("ASU 2011-12"), which indefinitely deferred certain provisions of ASU 2011-05, including the requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented.  This amendment is effective for both annual and interim financial statements beginning after December 15, 2011.  The Company's adoption of ASU 2011-12 will not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Topic 2010 -

Balance Sheet

("ASU 2011-11"), which contains new disclosure requirements regarding the nature of an entity's rights of set off and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments.  Under U.S. GAAP, certain derivative and repurchase agreement arrangements are granted exceptions from the general off-setting model. To facilitate comparison between financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP and IFRS, the new disclosure requirement will provide financial statement users information regarding both gross and net exposures.  This guidance is effective for annual and interim financial statements beginning on or after January 1, 2013.  Retrospective application is required.  The Company does not set off related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. Its adoption of ASU 2011-11 is not expected to have an impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Note 3. Net Income per Share

The Company computed basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Juniper Networks common stockholders as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Basic net income per share is computed using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, employee stock purchase plan, vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and vesting of performance share awards ("PSAs").

The Company excludes both outstanding stock options with exercise prices that are greater than the average market price and

RSUs with grant date fair market value that are greater than the average market price

from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. The Company includes the common shares underlying PSAs in the calculation of diluted net income per share when they become contingently issuable and excludes such shares when they are not contingently issuable. Potentially dilutive common shares of approximately

17.4 million

,

14.0 million

, and

38.9 million

shares were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

There were no material realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale and trading securities in 2011, 2010, and 2009. The Company generated cash proceeds of

$1,926.6 million

,

$1,624.4 million

, and

$683.8 million

from maturities and sales of our available-for-sale investments during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

The Company had


and


investments in unrealized loss positions as of

December 31, 2011

, and

December 31, 2010

, respectively. The gross unrealized losses related to these investments were primarily due to changes in market interest rates. For the fixed income securities that have unrealized losses, the Company determined that (i) it does not have the intent to sell any of these investments and (ii) it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. The Company did not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of

December 31, 2011

, and

December 31, 2010

. The Company reviews its investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment. The Company aggregates its investments by category and length of time the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position to facilitate its evaluation.

Restricted Cash and Investments

The Company classifies cash and investments as restricted cash and investments on its consolidated balance sheet for: (i) amounts held in escrow accounts, as required by certain acquisitions; (ii) the India Gratuity Trust and Israel Retirement Trust, which cover statutory severance obligations in the event of termination of the Company's India and Israel employees, respectively; and (iii) the Directors and Officers ("D&O") indemnification trust. During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, the Company distributed approximately

$42.0 million

of restricted cash, mainly related to the 2010 acquisitions.

In 2010, the Company increased its restricted cash and cash investments by

$261.9 million

, primarily for the escrow accounts required by the acquisitions completed in 2010, and to a lesser extent for the Israel Retirement Trust established in the first quarter of 2010. The increases in restricted cash were partially offset by distributions of approximately

$196.5 million

, mainly related to the 2010 acquisitions.

In connection with the 2010 acquisition of Ankeena Networks, Inc. ("Ankeena"), the Company agreed to pay from escrow a total amount of

$10.7 million

, representing the cash value of unvested restricted shares of Ankeena common stock as of April 8, 2010, held by certain former Ankeena employees. Through

Privately-Held Investments

The Company reviews its investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment. The Company adjusts its privately-held equity investments for any impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the respective assets on an other-than-temporary basis.

As of

December 31, 2011

, and

December 31, 2010

, the carrying values of the Company’s privately-held and other equity investments of

$51.8 million

and

$22.1 million

, respectively, were included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company invested a total of

$33.1 million

,

$13.3 million

, and

$7.2 million

, respectively, in privately-held equity investments. In 2010, as a result of the acquisitions of Ankeena and Altor Networks, Inc ("Altor"), the Company recognized a gain of

$3.2 million

and

$2.1 million

, respectively, from its minority equity investments in those companies.

In the year ended

December 31, 2011

, the Company recognized a loss of

$1.8 million

from the impairment of a privately-held investment that the Company judged to be other than temporary, partially offset by gains on other privately-held investments. In 2010, the Company determined there were

no

impairments to its privately-held equity investments During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized an impairment loss of

The Company's policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 as of the actual date of the events or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. During the years ended

December 31, 2011

, and 2010, the Company had

no

transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy of its assets or liabilities measured at fair value.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

As of

December 31, 2011

, and

December 31, 2010

, the carrying value of privately-held equity investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was

$0.4 million

and

$0.8 million

, respectively. These privately-held equity investments, which are normally carried at cost, were measured at fair value due to events and circumstances that the Company identified as significantly impacting the fair value of the investments.  The Company measured the fair value of its privately held equity investments using an analysis of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, including recent financing activities and their capital structure.  As a result, the Company recognized an impairment loss of

$1.8 million

and

$5.5 million

, in years ended

December 31, 2011

and 2009, respectively, and classified the investment as Level 3 assets due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.   There were

no

such charges in the year ended December 31, 2010.

The Company had

no

liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of

December 31, 2011

and

December 31, 2010

.

Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value

The carrying amounts of the Company's accounts receivable, financing receivables, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is disclosed in Note 10,

Financing

, and was determined using quoted market prices (Level 1).

Note 6. Derivative Instruments

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its market exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies and does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

The notional amount of Company's foreign currency derivatives are summarized as follows (in millions):

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of services and operating expenses. The derivatives are intended to protect the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the Company's planned cost of services and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Execution of these cash flow hedge derivatives typically occurs every month with maturities of

one year or less

. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the cost of services or operating expense line item to which the hedged transaction relates. The Company records any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments in other (expense) income, net in its consolidated statements of operations. Cash flows from such hedges are classified as operating activities. All amounts within other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified into earnings

within the next 12 months

.

The total fair value of the Company’s derivative assets located in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of

December 31, 2011

and

December 31, 2010

, was

$0.4 million

and

$0.4 million

, respectively. The total fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities located in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of

December 31, 2011

and

December 31, 2010

, was

$9.6 million

and

$2.6 million

, respectively.

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, the Company recognized a loss of

$7.9 million

in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of its derivative instruments and reclassified a gain of

$0.7 million

from other comprehensive income to operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized a loss of

$3.0 million

in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of its derivative instruments and reclassified a loss of

$2.1 million

from other comprehensive income to operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized a gain of

$0.6 million

in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of its derivative instruments and reclassified a gain of

$4.2 million

from other comprehensive income to operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

The ineffective portion of the Company's derivative instruments recognized in its consolidated statements of operations was

immaterial

during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Non-Designated Hedges

The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These hedges do not qualify for special hedge accounting treatment. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income and expense, net. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset within the consolidated statement of operations by re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such derivatives are classified as operating activities. The derivatives have maturities of

one

year or less.

The Company recognized a gain of

$1.5 million

, a loss of

$0.3 million

, and a gain of

$4.9 million

on non-designated derivative instruments within other (expense) income, net, in its consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Note 7. Business Combinations

The Company's consolidated financial statements include the operating results of acquired businesses from the date of each acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented as the financial impact to the Company's consolidated results of operations, both individually and in aggregate, is not material. Additional information existing as of the acquisition dates but unknown to the Company may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date, which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded.

The Company completed two business combinations in 2011 and four business combinations in 2010 for either cash consideration or cash consideration along with vested share-based awards assumed of approximately

$30.5 million

and

$394.5 million

, respectively. There were no acquisitions in 2009.  Total purchase consideration for these acquisitions at the acquisition dates was allocated as follows (in millions):

The Company recognized

$9.6 million

and

$6.3 million

of acquisition-related costs in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These acquisition related charges were expensed in the period incurred and reported in the Company's consolidated statement of operations within cost of revenues and operating expense.

The goodwill recognized for the 2011 acquisitions is attributable primarily to expected synergies.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) consists of existing research and development projects at the time of the acquisition. Projects that qualify as IPR&D assets represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. After initial recognition, acquired IPR&D assets are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Development costs incurred after acquisition on acquired development projects are expensed as incurred. Upon completion of development, acquired IPR&D assets are considered amortizable intangible assets. If the IPR&D project is abandoned, the Company writes off the related purchased intangible asset in the period it is abandoned.

$1.0 billion

of the Company’s common stock.

The Company repurchased and retired approximately

17.5 million

shares of its common stock at an average price of

$30.93

per share for an aggregate purchase price of

$541.2 million

during year ended

December 31, 2011

under its 2010 Stock Repurchase Program. The Company repurchased approximately

19.7 million

shares of its common stock at an average price of

$28.67

per share for a total purchase price of

$563.5 million

in the year ended December 31, 2010 under the two stock repurchase programs. There are

no

remaining authorized funds under the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program and

$213.8 million

remaining authorized funds under the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program as of

December 31, 2011

Share-Based Compensation Plans

The Company’s share-based compensation plans include the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), the 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”), the Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Plan (the “1996 Plan”), various equity incentive plans assumed through acquisitions, the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2008 Purchase Plan”), and the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("1999 Purchase Plan"). Under these plans, the Company has granted (or in the case of acquired plans, assumed) stock options, RSUs, and PSAs.

As of

December 31, 2011

, a total of approximately

105.2 million

shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance upon exercise of stock options and for the future grant of share-based compensation awards under the Company's equity incentive plans and the 2008 Purchase Plan.

The 2006 Plan, adopted and approved by the Company’s stockholders in May 2006, had an initial authorized share reserve of

64.5 million

shares of common stock plus the addition of any shares subject to options under the 2000 Plan and the 1996 Plan that were outstanding as of May 18, 2006, and that subsequently expire unexercised, up to a maximum of an additional

75.0 million

shares. In the second quarters of 2011 and 2010, the Company’s stockholders’ approved amendments to the 2006 Plan that increased the number of shares reserved for issuance thereby increasing the authorized share reserve by

30.0 million

shares in May 2011 and 2010. As of

December 31, 2011

, the 2006 Plan had

58.2 million

shares subject to currently outstanding equity awards and

41.1 million

shares available for future issuance. Options granted under the 2006 Plan have a maximum term of seven years from the grant date, and generally vest and become exercisable over a four-year period. Subject to the terms of change of control severance agreements, and except for a limited number of shares allowed under the 2006 Plan, RSUs or PSAs that vest solely based on continuing employment or provision of services will vest in full no earlier than three years from the grant date, or in the event vesting is based on factors other than continued future provision of services, such awards will vest in full no earlier than one year from the grant date.

In connection with past acquisitions, the Company assumed stock option and RSU awards under the stock plans of the acquired companies. The Company exchanged those awards for Juniper Networks' stock options and RSUs. As of

December 31, 2011

, stock options and RSUs covering approximately

1.4 million

shares of common stock were outstanding under awards assumed through the Company's past acquisitions.

The Company adopted the 2008 Purchase Plan, in May 2008, which replaced the 1999 Purchase Plan. The Board reserves an aggregate of

12.0 million

shares of the Company's common stock for issuance under this plan. The 2008 Purchase Plan is generally similar to the 1999 Purchase Plan, except that under the 2008 Purchase Plan, any increases to the number of shares reserved for issuance must be approved by the Company's stockholders. The 2008 Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock at a

15%

discount to the offering price (as determined in the 2008 Purchase Plan) through periodic payroll deductions of up to

10%

of base compensation, subject to individual purchase limits of

6,000

shares in any

twelve

Note 13. Segments

The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) allocates resources and assesses performance based on financial information by the Company’s business groups. The Company’s operations are organized into two reportable segments: Infrastructure and Service Layer Technology ("SLT"). The Infrastructure segment consists of routing and switching products and servic

es. Routing includes products and services from the E, M, MX, PTX, and T Series router families, and the network application platform, Junos Space. Switching primarily consists of products and services for EX Series and wireless local area network solutions, as well as, QFabric. The SLT segment includes SRX services and vGW virtual gateways, Firewall virtual private network systems and appliances, secure socket layer virtual private network appliances, the J Series router product family, intrusion detection and prevention appliances, wide area network optimization platforms, and Junos Pulse.

The primary financial measure used by the CODM in assessing performance of the segments is segment operating income, which includes certain cost of revenues, research and development (“R&D”) expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses. The CODM does not allocate certain miscellaneous expenses to its segments even though such expenses are included in the Company’s management operating income.

For arrangements with both Infrastructure and SLT products and services, revenue is attributed to the segment based on the underlying purchase order, contract, or sell-through report. Direct costs and operating expenses, such as standard costs, R&D, and product marketing expenses, are generally applied to each segment. Indirect costs, such as manufacturing overhead and other cost of revenues, are allocated based on standard costs. Indirect operating expenses, such as sales, marketing, business development, and G&A expenses are generally allocated to each segment based on factors including headcount, usage, and revenue. The CODM does not allocate share-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring and impairment charges, gains or losses on equity investments, other net income and expense, income taxes, or certain other charges to the segments.

,

$108.9 million

, and

$94.0 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The depreciation expense allocated to the SLT segment was

$32.2 million

,

$37.9 million

, and

$39.0 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

The Company attributes revenues to geographic region based on the customer’s ship-to location. The following table shows net revenues by geographic region (in millions):

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

,

no

single customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues.

Verizon Communications, Inc.

accounted for

10.6%

of the Company's total net revenues for 2010 and

AT&T, Inc.

accounted for

10.4%

of the Company's total net revenues for 2009.

The majority of the Company’s assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents and investments, as of

December 31, 2011

, and

December 31, 2010

, were attributable to U.S. operations. For both of the years ended

December 31, 2011

, and

December 31, 2010

, gross property and equipment held in the U.S., as a percentage of total property and equipment, was approximately

80%

Income Taxes

The components of income before the provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interest are summarized as follows (in millions):

The provision for income taxes is summarized as follows (in millions):

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to income before provision for income taxes as follows (in millions):

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carry-forward items and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

As of December 31, 2011, and 2010, the Company had a valuation allowance on its U.S. domestic deferred tax assets of approximately

$145.2 million

and

$122.2 million

, respectively. The balance at December 31, 2011 consisted of approximately

$94.3 million

and

$9.7 million

against the Company's California and Massachusetts deferred tax assets, respectively, which will not be utilized in the future years, and approximately

$41.2 million

related to losses that are capital in nature and may carry forward to offset future capital gains. The valuation allowance increased

$23.0 million

and

$9.4 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  Approximately

$13.7 million

and

$9.7 million

of the 2011 increase was due to changes in income apportioned to California and Massachusetts, respectively, and approximately

$9.4 million

of the 2010 increase relates to the income apportioned to California. The income apportioned to Massachusetts and California impacts the future taxable income within these states for the years in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be realized or settled.

As of December 31, 2011, the Company had federal and California net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately

$9.6 million

and

$39.6 million

, respectively. The Company also had California tax credit carry-forwards of approximately

$159.8 million

. Approximately

$21.3 million

of the benefit from the California tax credit carry-forwards will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized on the Company's income tax returns. Unused net operating loss carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year 2012. The California tax credit carry-forwards will carry forward indefinitely.

The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. The Company has made no provision for U.S. income taxes on approximately

$1,462.6 million

of cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2011, because it is the Company's intention to permanently reinvest such earnings. If such earnings were distributed, the Company would accrue additional income tax expense of approximately

$447.3 million

. These earnings are considered indefinitely invested in operations outside of the U.S., as we intend to utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of our international operations.

As of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was

$132.2 million

,

$116.4 million

, and

$183.6 million

, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, approximately

$117.2 million

of the

$132.2 million

gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was as follows (in millions):



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

As of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of

$17.3 million

,

$18.9 million

, and

$23.5 million

, respectively, within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized a benefit for net interest and penalties of

$1.6 million

, and

$4.6 million

, and an expense of

$14.8 million

in its consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

The Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of the gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately

$3.5 million

within the next twelve months due to lapses of applicable statutes of limitation in multiple jurisdictions that the Company operated in. However, at this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to the remaining unrecognized tax liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company resolved an audit by a state tax authority for the years from 2002 through 2004.  As the result of the settlement, the Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately

$7.0 million

including interest and penalties.

During 2010, the Company recognized approximately

$73.4 million

of tax benefits related to share based compensation, which the Company had previously recorded as unrecognized tax benefits in 2009.  On March 22, 2010, the Court overturned its May 27, 2009 decision in

Xilinx v. Commissioner

and affirmed the original U.S. Tax Court decision, which held in favor of the taxpayer. While Juniper Networks was not a named party to the case, the Court's decision eliminates the uncertainty regarding the benefit of the tax position taken by the Company in certain years prior to fiscal 2004 relative to the allocable transfer price of share-based compensation related to the Company's intangible development costs. The Court's decision affirms that the value of share-based compensation related to share-based compensation grants made prior to 2004 is not required to be included in cost sharing agreements between related parties. In light of the Court's decision, the Company has determined that the tax benefit recognized under its prior tax position is more likely than not to be sustained.

The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, Juniper Networks or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Ireland, Hong Kong, U.K., France, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, China, Australia, India, and the U.S. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2004, although carry-forward attributes that were generated prior to 2004 may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") if the attributes either have been or will be used in a future period.

The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the 2004 through 2009 tax years. The Company is also subject to two separate ongoing examinations by the India tax authorities for the 2004 tax year and 2004 through 2009 tax years, respectively. Additionally, the Company has not reached a final resolution with the IRS on an adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years. The Company is not aware of any other examination by taxing authorities in any other major jurisdictions in which it files income tax returns as of December 31, 2011.

In May 2011, as part of the 2005 and 2006 IRS audit, the Company received a proposed adjustment related to its intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement for the license of intangibles acquired in 2005. In 2009, as part of the 2004 IRS audit, the



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Company received a similar proposed adjustment related to the license of intangibles acquired in 2004. In December 2008, the Company received a proposed adjustment from the India tax authorities related to the 2004 tax year.

In 2009, the India tax authorities commenced a separate investigation of our 2004 through 2008 tax returns and are disputing the Company's determination of taxable income due to the cost basis of certain fixed assets. The Company accrued

$4.6 million

in penalties and interest in 2009 related to this matter. The Company understands that the India tax authorities may issue an initial assessment that is substantially higher than this amount. As a result, in accordance with the administrative and judicial process in India, the Company may be required to make payments that are substantially higher than the amount accrued in order to ultimately settle this issue. The Company strongly believes that any assessment it may receive in excess of the amount accrued would be inconsistent with applicable India tax laws and intends to defend this position vigorously.

The Company is pursuing all available administrative procedures relative to the matters referenced above. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these proposed adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations; however there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of these matters could have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For more information, please see Note 15,

Commitments and Contingencies

, under the heading “IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustments.”

Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

The following table summarizes the Company’s future principal contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2011

(in millions):

Operating Leases

The Company leases its facilities under operating leases that expire at various times, the longest of which expires on

November 30, 2022

. Future minimum payments under the non-cancelable operating leases totaled

$352.7 million

as of

December 31, 2011

. Rent expense for 2011, 2010, and 2009 was approximately

$65.7 million

,

$55.9 million

, and

$56.5 million

, respectively.

Purchase Commitments

In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, contract manufacturers utilized by the Company place non-cancelable, non-returnable (“NCNR”) orders for components based on the Company’s build forecasts. As of

December 31, 2011

, there were NCNR component orders placed by the contract manufacturers with a value of

$150.6 million

. The contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on the Company’s forecasts and customer purchase orders received by the Company. Generally, the Company does not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to the Company and immediately to the Company’s customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components remain unused or the products remain unsold for specified periods, the Company may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that the contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet the Company’s forecast or customer orders. As of

December 31, 2011

, the Company had accrued

$14.8 million

based on its estimate of such charges.

Tax Liabilities



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

As of

December 31, 2011

, the Company had

$108.5 million

included in long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to the

$108.5 million

due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

Long-Term Debt and Interest Payment on Long-Term Debt

As of

December 31, 2011

, the Company held long-term debt with a carrying value of

$999.0 million

. Of these Notes,

$300.0 million

will mature in


and bears interest at a fixed rate of

3.10%

,

$300.0 million

will mature in


and bears interest at a fixed rate of

4.60%

, and

$400.0 million

will mature in


and bears interest at

5.95%

. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually. See Note 10,

Financing

, for further discussion of the Company's long-term debt.

Other Contractual Obligations

As of

December 31, 2011

, other contractual obligations primarily consisted of

$25.1 million

in indemnity-related and service related escrows, required by certain acquisitions completed in 2005, 2010 and 2011,

$30.7 million

in obligations related to a  office campus build-out adjacent to the Company's headquarters, and other miscellaneous commitments.

Guarantees

The Company enters into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. The Company also has financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, customs and duties guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. As of

December 31, 2011

, and 2010, the Company had

$19.9 million

and

$21.6 million

, respectively, in bank guarantees and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions, including, but not limited to, the matters described below. The Company is aggressively defending its current litigation matters, and while the Company currently believes that there are no existing claims or proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses.

IPO Allocation Case

In December 2001, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Royal Bank of Canada (Dain Rauscher Wessels), SG Cowen Securities Corporation, UBS Warburg LLC (Warburg Dillon Read LLC), Chase (Hambrecht & Quist LLC), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers, Inc., Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (collectively, the “Underwriters”), Juniper Networks and certain of Juniper Networks' officers. This action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company's common stock in its initial public offering in June 1999 and the Company's secondary offering in September 1999. Specifically, among other things, this complaint alleged that the prospectus pursuant to which shares of common stock were sold in the Company's initial public offering and the Company's subsequent secondary offering contained certain false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the practices of the Underwriters with respect to their allocation of shares of common stock in these offerings and their receipt of commissions from customers related to such allocations. Various plaintiffs have filed actions asserting similar allegations concerning the initial public offerings of approximately


other issuers. These various cases pending in the Southern District of New York have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as

In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation

, 21 MC 92. In April 2002, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint in the action against the Company, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The defendants in the coordinated proceeding filed motions to dismiss. On February 19, 2003, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss,



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

but declined to dismiss the claims against the Company.

The parties have reached a global settlement of the litigation. Under the settlement, the insurers are to pay the full amount of settlement share allocated to the Company, and the Company will bear no financial liability. The Company and other defendants will receive complete dismissals from the case. In October 2009, the Court entered an Opinion and Order granting final approval of the settlement. Certain objectors appealed; these appeals have now been dismissed or withdrawn

. As a result, the case is now settled.

2011 Federal Securities Class Action

On August 15, 2011, a purported securities class action lawsuit, captioned

City of Royal Oak Retirement System v. Juniper Networks, Inc., et al.

, Case No. 11-cv-04003-LHK, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California naming the Company and certain of its officers and directors as defendants.  The complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business and prospects.  On January 9, 2012 the Court appointed City of Omaha Police and Fire Retirement System and City of Bristol Pension Fund as lead plaintiff.  Lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on February 13, 2012.  The amended complaint alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements about Juniper's business and future prospects, and failed to adequately disclose the impact of certain changes in accounting rules.  The amended complaint purports to assert claims for violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 on behalf of those who purchased or otherwise acquired Juniper's common stock between July 20, 2010 and July 26, 2011, inclusive.

2011 California State Derivative Lawsuits

Between August 22 and September 9, 2011, four purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, naming certain of the Company's officers and directors as defendants.  The Company is named only as a nominal defendant in the actions.  The actions were consolidated as

In re Juniper Networks, Inc. Shareholder Litigation

, Case No. 1-11-CV-207701 (Lead Case), by order dated September 12, 2011.  The complaints are generally based upon the disclosures and alleged omissions challenged in the securities class action.  The complaints purport to assert claims against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets.  The complaints seek, among other relief, damages in an unspecified amount, restitution, and attorneys' fees and costs.

2011 Federal Derivative Lawsuit

On September 27, 2011 and December 28, 2011, two purported shareholder derivative actions, captioned

Ratinova v. Johnson, et al.

, Case No. 11-cv-04792 and Lisa E. Coppola, ERA v. Johnson, et al., Case No. 11-cv-06667, respectively, were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California naming certain of the Company's officers and directors as defendants.  The Company is named only as a nominal defendant in the action.  Like the state derivative actions, the federal derivative lawsuits are generally based upon the disclosures and alleged omissions challenged in the securities class action.  The complaints purport to assert claims against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment.  The complaints seek, among other relief, damages in an unspecified amount, restitution, and attorneys' fees and costs. By order dated January 30, 2012, the Court consolidated the actions as

In re Juniper Networks, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation

, Master File No. 11-cv-04792-LHK. On February 3, 2012, the parties filed a stipulation in which the parties requested that the Court stay the action until such time as the Court entered an order denying a motion to dismiss in the related federal securities class action described above.  On February 6, 2012, the Court granted the parties' stipulation.

IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustments

In May 2011, as a result of its audit of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2005 and 2006 fiscal years, the IRS issued a Preliminary Notice of Deficiency (“PNOD”) regarding the Company's transfer pricing transactions under its intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement related to the license of intangibles acquired in 2005. The asserted changes would affect the Company's income tax liabilities for tax years subsequent to 2004. Because of the PNOD, the estimated incremental tax liabilities for all relative tax years would be approximately

$92.0 million

, excluding interest and penalties. The Company has filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which is under review by the Appeals Division of the IRS.

In 2009, the Company received a PNOD from the IRS claiming that the Company owes additional taxes, plus interest and possible penalties, for the 2004 tax year based on a transfer pricing transaction related to the license of acquired intangibles



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

under an intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement. The asserted changes to the Company's 2004 tax year would affect the Company's income tax liabilities in tax years subsequent to 2003. In addition, the Company has not reached a final resolution with the IRS on an adjustment the IRS proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years. Because of the PNOD, the estimated incremental tax liability would be approximately

$807.0 million

, excluding interest and penalties. The Company has filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the IRS, which is under review by the Appeals Division of the IRS.

The Company strongly believes the IRS' position with regard to transfer pricing transactions for the Company's 2004 through 2006 fiscal years are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, judicial precedent and existing Treasury regulations, and that the Company's previously reported income tax provisions for the years in question are appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in the Company's favor. Regardless of whether these matters are resolved in the Company's favor, the final resolution of these matters could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and/or settle. While the Company believes it has provided adequately for these matters, there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome from these matters could have a material effect on its results of operations and financial condition.

In September 2008, as part of its ongoing audit of the U.S. federal income tax return for the 2004 fiscal year, the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) regarding the Company's business credits. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to this proposed adjustment.

The Company is also under routine examination by certain state and non-U.S. tax authorities. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these audits.



Note 16. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The table below sets forth selected unaudited financial data for each quarter of the two years ended December 31, 2011 (in millions, except per share amounts):

(1) Restructuring and other charges consisted of restructuring charges and asset impairment charges. In the third quarter of 2011, the Company implemented the 2011 Restructuring Plan for workforce reduction and recorded restructuring charges of

$16.8 million

. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a charge of

$13.5 million

associated with an abandoned in-process internal used software project.

(2) Acquisition-related and other charges comprised of direct and indirect costs such as financial advisory, legal, and due diligence, as well as integration costs related to the acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2011.

(3) Net income per share attributable to Juniper Network stockholders is computed independently. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly net income per share may not equal the total computed for the fiscal year or any cumulative interim period.



(1) Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company implemented a plan that resulted in reduction in workforce and facilities in certain business operations.

(2) Acquisition-related and other charges comprised of direct and indirect costs such as financial advisory, legal, due diligence, and integration costs from the four acquisitions completed in 2010.

(3) Net income per share attributable to Juniper Network stockholders is computed independently. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly net income per share may not equal the total computed for the fiscal year or any cumulative interim period.

Note 17. Subsequent Event

Stock Repurchases

Subsequent to December 31, 2011, through the filing of this report, the Company repurchased

2.4 million

shares of its common stock, for

$51.6 million

at an average purchase price of

$21.75

per share, under its 2010 Stock Repurchase Program. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company's 2010 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of

$162.2 million

. Purchases under the Company's 2010 Stock Repurchase Program are subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and will be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. This program may be discontinued at any time.

Business Acquisition

On February 13, 2012, the Company acquired Mykonos Software, a provider of Intrusion Deception Systems that protect websites and web applications, for cash consideration of approximately

$80.0 million

. This acquisition enables the Company to



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

extend its security portfolio with the intrusion deception system that is capable of detecting an attacker before an attack is in progress. The Company is in the process of determining the net assets acquired and goodwill associated with this acquisition.

Segment Changes

In the first quarter of 2012, the Company has aligned its organization structure to focus on its platform and software strategy. Beginning 2012, the Company will conform its reportable segments to this new business structure.

Controls and Procedures

(a)

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:

Please see "Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" under Item 8 on page 54 of this Form 10-K, which report is incorporated herein by reference.

(b) For the “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,” please see the report under Item 8 on page 53 of this Form 10-K, which report is incorporated herein by reference.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Attached, as exhibits to this report are certifications of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). This “Controls and Procedures” section includes information concerning the controls and related evaluations referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Controls

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of


that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our control system’s objective will be met and our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of these controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over



time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
