PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

At Juniper Networks, we design, develop, and sell products and services for high-performance networks so customers can build highly scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility, efficiency and value through automation. We sell our products in more than 100 countries in three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia Pacific ("APAC"). We sell our high-performance network products and service offerings across routing, switching, and security.

Our products address high-performance network requirements for global service providers, cloud environments, enterprises, governments, and research and public sector organizations who view the network as critical to their success. Our silicon, systems, and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking, helping customers achieve superior performance, greater choice, and flexibility, while reducing overall total cost of ownership. In addition to our products, we offer our customers worldwide services, including technical support, professional services, education and training programs. Together, our high-performance product and service offerings help our customers convert legacy networks providing commoditized services into more valuable assets providing differentiation and value as well as increased performance, reliability, and security to end-users.

In 2014, we realigned our organization into a One-Juniper structure which includes consolidating each of our research and development and go-to-market functions to reduce complexity, increase clarity of responsibilities, and improve efficiency. As a result of these changes, our consolidated business is considered to be one reportable segment. See Note 13,

Segments

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for further information regarding the Company's segment reorganization, as well as revenue and other information regarding our one reportable segment.

We were incorporated in California in 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998. Our corporate headquarters are located in Sunnyvale, California. Our website address is www.juniper.net.

Strategy

We deliver highly scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks, while transforming the network's agility, efficiency and value through automation. We focus on customers and partners across our key verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their business; including global service providers, enterprises, financial services, cloud hosting providers, governments, research and public sector organizations.

Our strategy stems from the importance of our hardware-based innovation in achieving the routing, switching, and security performance that our customers require, while at the same time addressing software innovation to achieve new levels of agility for our customers.



Maintain and Extend Technology Leadership

We are recognized around the world as a leader in networking innovation. Our Junos OS, application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) technology, and network-optimized product architecture were key elements to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership.

Leverage Position as Supplier of High-Performance Network Infrastructure

From inception, we have focused on designing, developing, and building high-performance network infrastructure for the world's most demanding networking environments. We consistently deliver groundbreaking, leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networking—significantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them. We believe that many customers will deploy networking equipment from only a few vendors, and that the scale, performance, reliability, and security of our products will provide us with a competitive advantage, which is critical to be selected as one of those vendors.

Be a Strategic Partner to Our Customers

In developing our solutions, we work very closely with customers to design and build best-in-class products and solutions specifically designed to meet their complex needs. Over time, we have expanded our understanding of the escalating demands and risks facing our customers, which has enabled us to design additional capabilities into our products. We believe our close relationships with, and constant feedback from, our customers have been key elements in our design wins and rapid deployments to date. We plan to continue to work with our customers to implement product enhancements, as well as to design products that meet the evolving needs of the marketplace, while enabling customers to reduce costs. We are committed to investing in research and development at a level that drives our innovation agenda, enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers.

Enable New Internet Protocol ("IP")-Based Services

Our platforms have enabled network operators to quickly build and secure networks cost-effectively and deploy new differentiated services to drive new sources of revenue more efficiently than legacy network products. By enabling new IP-based services, we have broadened our service provider business over the last several years, while also expanding our presence in the enterprise market.

Establish and Develop Industry Partnerships

Our customers have diverse requirements. Therefore, we believe that it is important that we attract and build relationships with other industry leaders with diverse technologies and services that extend the value of the network to our customers. These partnerships ensure that our customers have access to those technologies and services, whether through technology integration, joint development, resale, or other collaboration, in order to better support a broader set of our customers' requirements. In addition, we believe an open network infrastructure that invites partner innovation provides customers with greater choice and control in meeting their evolving business requirements, while enabling them to reduce costs.

Markets and Customers

We sell our high-performance network products and service offerings through direct sales, distributors, value-added resellers ("VARs"), and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners to end-users in the service provider and enterprise markets. We believe the network needs for service providers, such as carriers (wireless and wireline), cable, content and cloud service companies are converging, as are those of large enterprises and national governments, as all of these customers focus on high performance networks and build cloud environments.



Service Providers

Service providers generally include wireline and wireless carriers, and cable operators, as well as major Internet content and application providers, including those that provide social networking and search engine services. We support most of the major service provider networks in the world and our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are designed and built for the performance, reliability, and security that service providers demand. We believe our networking infrastructure offerings benefit our service provider customers by:

•

Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple services over the same network using our secure, high density, highly automated, and highly reliable platforms;

•

Creating new or additional revenue opportunities by enabling new services to be offered to new market segments, which includes existing customers and new customers, based on our product capabilities;

•

Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by enabling customers to self-select automatically provisioned service packages that provide the quality, speed, and pricing they desire; and

•

Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on investment as our customers' networks can scale to multi-terabit rates based on the capabilities of our platforms.

While many of these service providers have historically been categorized separately as wireline, wireless, or cable operators, in recent years, we have seen increased convergence of these different types of service providers through acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships. We believe the convergence of offerings by service providers is facilitated by investment in the build-out of high performance networks and cloud environments.

We believe that there are several other trends affecting service providers for which we are well positioned to deliver products and solutions. These trends include: significant growth in IP traffic on service provider networks because of peer-to-peer interaction; broadband usage; video; an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our service provider customers and of their enterprise customers; the advent of data center "clouds" that concentrate business applications in large, IP network connected facilities; and growth in mobile traffic as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones, tablets, and connected devices of all kinds.

The infrastructure market for service providers includes: products and technology at the network core; the network edge to enable access; the aggregation layer; the data center where many services are created; security to protect from the inside out and the outside in; the application awareness and intelligence to optimize the network to meet business and user needs; and the management, service awareness, and control of the entire infrastructure.

Enterprise

Our high-performance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance, reliability, and security requirements of the world's most demanding businesses. The enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses; federal, state, and local governments; financial services; and research and education institutions. Enterprises and public sector organizations, such as governments and research and education institutions, that view their networks as critical to their success are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge applications. In addition, our solutions:

•

Assist in the consolidation and delivery of existing services and applications;

•

Accelerate the deployment of new services and applications;

•

Offer network security across every environment—from the data center to campus and branch environments to assist in the protection and recovery of services and applications; and

•

Offer operational improvements that enable cost reductions, including lower administrative, training, customer care, and labor costs.



As with the service provider market, innovation continues to be a critical component in our strategy for the enterprise market. High-performance enterprises require IP networks that are global, distributed, and always available. Network equipment vendors serving these enterprises need to demonstrate performance, reliability, and security with best-in-class open solutions for maximum flexibility. We offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers, branch and campus applications, distributed and extended enterprises.

Customers

In 2014 and 2013,

no

single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues. In 2012, Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon") accounted for

10.3%

of our net revenues.

Products and Technology

Early in our history, we developed, marketed, and sold the first commercially available purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the specific high-performance requirements of service providers. As the need for core bandwidth continued to increase, the need for service rich platforms at the edge of the network was created.

We have expanded our portfolio to address domains in the network: the core, the edge, access and aggregation, data centers, WANs, and campus and branch. We have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon, systems, and software (both our Junos OS as well as SDN and automation software) to provide a range of solutions in high-performance networking that can solve unique problems for customers.

Our focus on high-performance networking leads to focus in three product areas: routing, switching, and security.

Sales and Marketing

As of

December 31, 2014

, we employed

2,348

people in our worldwide sales and marketing organization. These sales and marketing employees operate in different locations around the world in support of our customers.

Our sales organization, with its structure of sales professionals, system engineers, and marketing and channel teams, is generally split between service provider and enterprise customers. Within each team, sales team members serve the following three geographic regions: (i) Americas (including United States, Canada, Mexico, Caribbean and Central and South America), (ii) EMEA, and (iii) APAC. Within each region, there are regional and country teams, as well as vertical market focused teams, to ensure we operate close to our customers.

Our sales teams operate in their respective regions and generally either engage customers directly or manage customer opportunities through our distribution and reseller relationships or channels as described below.

In the United States and Canada, we sell to several service providers directly and sell to other service providers and enterprise customers primarily through distributors and resellers. Almost all of our sales outside the United States and Canada are made through our channel partners.

Direct Sales Structure

Our sales team engages with end-user customers with whom we have direct relationships. The terms and conditions of these arrangements are governed either by customer purchase orders and our acknowledgment of those orders or by purchase contracts. The direct contracts with these customers set forth only general terms of sale and generally do not require customers to purchase specified quantities of our products. We directly receive and process customer purchase orders.

Channel Sales Structure

A critical part of our sales and marketing efforts are our channel partners through which we conduct the majority of our sales. We utilize various channel partners, including but not limited to the following:

•

A global network of strategic distributor relationships, as well as region-specific or country-specific distributors who in turn sell to local VARs who sell to end-user customers. Our distribution channel partners resell routing, switching and security products which are purchased by both enterprise and service provider customers. These distributors tend to be focused on particular regions or countries within regions. For example, we have substantial distribution relationships with Ingram Micro in the Americas and Hitachi in Japan. Our agreements with these distributors are generally non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product and service discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require our distributors to purchase specified quantities of our products or services. Further, most of our distributors sell our competitor's products and services, and some sell their own competing products and services.



•

VARs and Direct value-added resellers ("DVARs"), including our strategic worldwide resellers referenced below, that resell our products to end-users around the world. These channel partners either buy our products and services through VARs, or directly from us, and have expertise in designing, selling, and deploying complex networking solutions in their respective markets. Our agreements with these channel partners are generally non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product and service discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require these channel partners to purchase specified quantities of our products or services. Increasingly, our service provider customers also resell our products or services to their customers or purchase our products or services for the purpose of providing managed or cloud-based services to their customers.

•

Strategic worldwide reseller relationships with established historical Juniper alliances, comprised of, Nokia Solutions Networks B.V. ("NSN"), Ericsson Telecom A.B. (“Ericsson”), Dimension Data, and International Business Machines ("IBM"). These companies each offer services and products that complement our own product and service offerings and act as a reseller, and in some instances as an integration partner for our products. Our arrangements with these partners allow them to resell our products and services on a worldwide, non-exclusive basis, provide for product and service discounts, and specify other general terms of sale. These agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products or services.

Customer Service

In addition to our products, we offer support, professional, and educational services. We deliver these services directly to our channel partners and to end-users and utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our partners, and third-party organizations, as appropriate.

We also train our channel partners in the delivery of support, professional, and educational services to ensure these services are locally delivered.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we employed

1,493

people in our worldwide customer service and support organization. We believe that a broad range of services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products, and we employ support engineers, consultants, and educators with proven network experience to provide those services.

Manufacturing and Operations

As of

December 31, 2014

, we employed


people in worldwide manufacturing and operations who primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain and sub-tier suppliers, and monitor and manage product testing and quality.

Our manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers in the United States ("U.S."), China, Malaysia, Mexico, and Taiwan. As of

December 31, 2014

, we utilize Celestica Incorporated, Flextronics International Ltd., Accton Technology Corporation, and Alpha Networks Inc. for the majority of our manufacturing activity. Our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers in all locations are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production and assist with activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers, and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers, we design, specify, and monitor the tests that are required for our products to meet internal and external quality standards. These arrangements provide us with the following benefits:

•

We can quickly deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing and drop-shipment capabilities;

•

We gain economies of scale by leveraging our buying power with our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers when we purchase large quantities of components;

•

We operate with a minimum amount of dedicated space for manufacturing operations; and

•

We can reduce our costs by reducing what would normally be fixed overhead expenses.

Our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts. Each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and tests the products according to agreed-upon specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors, VARs, or end-users. Generally, we do not own the components. Title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturer's location. Customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination. If the components



remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.

Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers, those contracts merely set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and outside design manufacturer, as applicable, may accept purchase orders from us. The contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long-term basis.

We also purchase and hold inventory for strategic reasons and to mitigate the risk of shortages of certain critical component supplies. The majority of our inventory is production components. As a result, we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges, particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand.

Some of our custom components, such as application-specific integrated circuits ("ASICs") are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources, each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs.

By working collaboratively with our suppliers, we have the opportunity to promote socially responsible business practices beyond our company and into our worldwide supply chain. To this end, we have adopted a supplier code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers. One element of our supplier code of conduct is adoption and compliance with the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (“EICC”). The EICC outlines standards to promote ethical business practices, eliminate human trafficking, and ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, workers are treated with respect and dignity, and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible. Our Corporate Citizenship Report and Supplier Code of Conduct are available on our website.

Backlog

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under framework agreements with our customers. At any given time, we have backlog orders for products that have not shipped. Because customers may cancel purchase orders or change delivery schedules without significant penalty, we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results. As of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, our total product backlog was approximately

$445.3 million

and

$470.7 million

, respectively. Our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products scheduled to be shipped to customers, generally within the next six months, and excludes orders from distributors as we recognize product revenue on sales made through distributors upon sell-through to end-users. Backlog also excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals, sales return reserves, service revenue allocations, and early payment discounts.

Seasonality

We, as do many companies in our industry, experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns. Historically, we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance.

Competition

We compete in the network infrastructure markets. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking solutions that offer agility advantages. In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") has historically been the dominant player. However, our principal competitors also include Alcatel-Lucent, Arista Networks, Inc. ("Arista"), Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. ("Brocade"), Hewlett Packard Company ("HP"), and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. ("Huawei").

Many of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, HP, and Huawei, among others, bundle their products with other networking products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and resellers by competitors, can increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, marketing budgets, and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, negatively affecting our operating results.

In addition, there are a number of other competitors in the security space, including Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. ("Check Point"), F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5 Networks"), Fortinet, Inc. ("Fortinet"), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. ("Palo Alto Networks"), among others, who tend to be focused on single product line solutions and, therefore, may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line.



In addition to established competitors, a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address. We believe that our ability to compete with Cisco and others depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers.

We expect that over time, large companies with significant resources, technical expertise, market experience, customer relationships, and broad product lines, such as Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei, will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market. There are also several other companies that claim to have products with greater capabilities than our products. Further, there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry, with smaller companies being acquired by larger, established suppliers of network infrastructure products. We believe this trend is likely to continue.

As a result, we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have. Although we believe that our technology and the purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful.

Environment

We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain. Our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive, Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations adopted by the European Union and China. To date, compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. However, see the risk factor entitled "Regulation of industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects" in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part I of this Report for additional information concerning RoHS compliance.

We are also voluntarily participating in the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and encourage our direct material suppliers representing an aggregate of at least 80% of our consolidated total direct expenditure to do the same. CDP is a global standardized mechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to institutional investors. In fact, in 2014, we achieved a position on CDP’s S&P 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index, the S&P 500 Climate Performance Leadership Index, and the CDP Supplier Climate Performance Leadership Index 2014. We continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to be able to inventory and measure our carbon footprint on a global basis. We believe we have made significant strides in improving our energy efficiency around the world.

In addition, we are committed to the environment through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency of key elements in our high-performance network product offerings. In 2012, we launched a set of carrier-class MPLS switches, the PTX5000 series. In addition to filling the capacity and density requirement for Internet core growth, PTX5000, which featured record energy efficiency of 1.5W per Gigabit of throughput. In 2014, we further enhanced the PTX5000 series and introduced the FPC2 for the PTX5000 MPLS switches, which features energy efficiency of 1.2W per Gigabit of throughput, and we also launched the MPC6 for our MX2020 and MX2010 3D Universal Edge Routers, which uses 2W per Gigabit of full-duplex traffic. The environment will remain a focus area across multiple aspects of our business.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise, as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights. While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark law, as well as confidentiality agreements, to protect our technology, we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology.

In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products and, from time to time, we license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. There can be no assurance that third-party licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



As of

December 31, 2014

, we had over 2,400 patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed, that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

8,806

full-time employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. We believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.

Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key technical, sales, and senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by an employment agreement requiring service for any defined period of time. The loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Investments in our securities involve significant risks. Even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings, whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results, changes in the mix of the products and services sold, acquisitions, industry changes, or other factors, could trigger, and have triggered in the past, significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. Investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us, including, but not limited to, the following factors, that could affect our business, operating results and stock price.

Our quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations; as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate.

The factors that may cause our quarterly results to vary quarter by quarter and be unpredictable include, but are not limited to: limited visibility into customer spending plans, changes in the mix of products and services sold, changes in the mix of geographies in which our products and services are sold, changing market and economic conditions, current and potential customer consolidation, competition, customer concentration, long sales and implementation cycles, unpredictable ordering patterns, changes in the amount and frequency of share repurchases or dividends, regional economic and political conditions, and seasonality. For example, we, and many companies in our industry, experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending, particularly in the first quarter. Furthermore market trends, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, seasonal rebates, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may necessitate adjustments to our operations. Such adjustments may be difficult or impossible to execute in the short or medium term.

As a result of these factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely that in some quarters, our operating results will be below our guidance, our long-term financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock may decline. Such a decline could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenues and/or earnings guidance.

A limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and there is an ongoing trend toward consolidation in the industry in which our customers and partners operate. Any decrease in revenues from our customers or partners could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results.

A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners, particularly in our service provider market. Changes in the business requirements, vendor selection, project prioritization, financial prospects, capital resources, and expenditures, or purchasing behavior (including product mix purchased) of our key customers could significantly decrease our sales to such customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services, which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, in recent years, there has been movement towards consolidation in the telecommunications industry (for example, Vodafone’s acquisition of Spanish cable operator, Ono, Numericable’s purchase of SFR, France’s second-largest telecommunications operator, the acquisition of TW Telecom by Level 3 Communications, AT&T’s proposed acquisition of DirectTV, and Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable) and that consolidation trend has continued. If our customers or partners are parties to consolidation transactions they may delay, suspend or indefinitely reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or other direct or indirect unforeseen consequences could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results.

Our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, decreased revenues and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate



forecasts to our contract manufacturers and manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses. In addition, economic uncertainty, as well as continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, have, and may continue to, put pressure on global economic conditions, which has led, and could continue to lead, to reduced demand for our products, to delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects, and/or higher costs of production. For example, if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies such as the Euro, our revenues reported in U.S. dollars would decline. In addition, for U.S. dollar denominated sales, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would increase the real cost to customers of our products in markets outside the U.S., which could impact our competitive position. More generally-speaking, economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers, an increase in customer bad debt, restructuring initiatives and associated expenses, and impairment of investments. Furthermore, instability in the global credit markets may adversely impact the ability of our customers to adequately fund their expected capital expenditures, which could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services. Our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses is, and will continue to be, fixed in the short and medium term. Therefore, fluctuations in revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margins from quarter to quarter.

Uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Future or continued economic weakness, failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness, customer financial difficulties, increases in costs of production, and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions, and such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions.

In periods of market expansion, we have increased investment in our business by, for example, increasing headcount and increasing our investment in R&D, sales and marketing, and other parts of our business. Conversely, in 2014, to refocus the Company’s strategy, optimize its structure and improve operational efficiencies in connection with our integrated operating plan, or IOP, we implemented a new strategic focus, realigned our organization into a One-Juniper structure, reduced our workforce, consolidated and closed facilities, made changes to enhance efficiency, improved cost management measures and instituted new capital allocation plan. In connection with cost management, we implemented a substantial cost reduction plan accomplished through various restructuring activities across research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the underperformance of our Security reporting unit and product rationalizations. Further strategy-related pivots could lead to delays in achieving revenue and profit forecasts and result in additional impairment. Some of our expenses are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees. Rapid changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including sales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.

A customer's decision to purchase certain of our products, particularly new products, involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the sales cycle may be lengthy. In particular, customers making critical decisions regarding the design and implementation of large network deployments may engage in very lengthy procurement processes that may delay or impact expected future orders. Throughout the sales cycle, we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer, the size of the network deployment, the complexity of the customer's network environment, and the degree of hardware and operating system configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers



with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times, both of which may be exacerbated by the impact of continued global economic weakness, may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter-to-quarter.

We face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results.

Competition is intense in the markets that we serve. The network equipment market has historically been dominated by Cisco, with competition coming from other companies such as Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade, Hewlett Packard Company, and Huawei. In the security market, we face intense competition from these same companies as well as companies such as Check Point, F5 Networks, Fortinet, and Palo Alto Networks. Further, a number of other small public and private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges and markets that our products address.

In addition, actual or speculated consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition of our partners and/or resellers by competitors, can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as, customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all. For example, in recent years, Oracle acquired Acme Packet, Inc., and Cisco acquired Meraki Networks, Inc. and Sourcefire, Inc., which further consolidated our market. A number of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price, we could experience a loss in market share and revenues and/or be required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins, and which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our partners and resellers generally sell or resell competing products on a non-exclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete, which could also adversely affect our business.

We expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time, and the level of product gross margins achieved by us in recent years may not be sustainable.

We expect our product gross margins to vary from quarter-to-quarter, and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors, including customer, product and geographic mix shifts, increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete, increases in material, labor, or inventory carrying costs, excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers, increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if we do not accurately forecast product demand, warranty related issues, or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures. For example, in the third quarter of 2012, our margins declined as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand. We determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term. As a result, a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter-to-quarter. Failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.

Further, in early 2014, we announced our IOP, which in combination with our new cost reduction initiative, announced in October 2014, is intended to reduce our operating expenses and to focus on cost controls. We expect that our margins will, accordingly, vary with our ability to achieve the goals of the IOP as supplemented by the new cost reduction initiative, as well as our ability to maintain or increase our revenues. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve all of the goals of these plans or meet our announced expectations, in whole or in part, or that our plans will have the intended effect of improving our margins on the expected timeline, or at all.

To the extent we receive product orders late in a quarter, we may be unable to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period, which could adversely affect our quarterly revenues.

Generally, our network equipment products are not stocked by distributors or resellers due to their cost and complexity and the custom nature of configurations required by our customers; we generally build such products as orders are received. In recent years, the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter has generally stabilized but remains unpredictable. If orders for certain products are received late in any quarter, we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our expected revenues for such quarter. Additionally, we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term. As a result, a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter-to-quarter.



Conversion of key internal systems and processes, particularly our ERP system, and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with, and therefore harm, our business and operations.

We have underway a multi-phase project to convert certain key internal systems and processes, including our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system and enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system. Since 2012, we have been implementing major changes to our ERP system, which activities we expect to continue into 2015. In the third quarter of 2014, we implemented the manufacturing, fulfillment, and inventory portion of this ERP project and we are now reliant upon dual ERP systems until completion of the conversion. The next major change to our ERP program is projected for the third quarter of 2015, when we plan to eliminate the dual ERP System. A delay past this time could result in postponement of this systems change until the first quarter of 2016. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes. Any problems, disruptions, delays or other issues in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes, particularly any that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide service and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, collect cash from our customers, maintain our DSO measure, fulfill contractual obligations, record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner, recognize revenue, file SEC reports in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. Even if we do not encounter these adverse effects, as noted above, the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated and in the event of lengthy project delays, we may experience issues with retention of the implementation team. If we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned, or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more lengthy or costly than anticipated, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain, and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future.

We rely on single or limited sources of certain of our components. During periods of high demand for electronic products, component shortages are possible, and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited. Any future spike in growth in our business, or more likely in IT spending and the economy in general is likely to create greater short-term pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner, and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. For example, from time to time, we have experienced component shortages that resulted in delays of product shipments. We currently purchase numerous key components, including ASICs, from single or limited sources. The development of alternate sources for those components is time-consuming, difficult, and costly. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. Also, long-term supply and maintenance obligations to customers increase the duration for which specific components are required, which may further increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory. In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. If we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers, which would seriously affect present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, the development, licensing, or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business.

We rely on value-added and other resellers, as well as distribution partners, to sell our products, and disruptions to, or our failure to effectively develop and manage, our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products.

Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of value-added and other reseller and distribution partners, including our worldwide strategic partners such as Ericsson, IBM, and NSN. The majority of our revenues are derived through value-added resellers and distributors, most of which also sell our competitors’ products, and some of which sell their own competing products. Our revenues depend in part on the performance of these partners. The loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues. For example, in 2011 and 2012, one of our OEM partners, Dell, acquired Force10 and SonicWall, both competitors of ours. As a result, Dell became increasingly competitive in certain areas, their resale of our products declined, and we ultimately terminated our OEM relationship with Dell. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products. If we fail to develop and maintain relationships with our partners, fail to develop new relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new markets, fail to expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets, fail to manage, train or motivate existing



value-added resellers and distributors effectively, determine that we cannot continue to do business with these partners for any reason or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations would suffer.

In addition, we recognize a portion of our revenues based on a sell-through model using information provided by our distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted.

Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and scale and improve our processes and procedures that support the channel. As a result, our programs, processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage. We have previously entered into OEM agreements with partners pursuant to which they rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios. These types of relationships are complex and require additional processes and procedures that may be challenging and costly to implement, maintain and manage. Our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the programs, processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products.

System security risks, data protection breaches, and cyber-attacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price.

In the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Increasingly, companies, including us, are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to penetration or attacks by computer programmers and hackers, or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products, and the information stored on our networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and cause us reputational and financial harm. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks.

If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers, many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded, to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques. This could impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. In addition, the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker, which are often difficult to pinpoint.

Regulation of industry in general and the telecommunications industry in particular could harm our operating results and future prospects.

We are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas. For example, some governments have regulations prohibiting government entities from purchasing security products that do not meet specified indigenous certification criteria, even though those criteria may be in conflict with accepted international standards. Other regulations that may negatively impact our business include country of origin regulations. These types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (“DRC”) and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals.” These minerals are present in our products. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply DRC “conflict free” components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the "conflict minerals” used in our products.



In addition, environmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations, including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment, may adversely impact our business and financial condition. These laws and regulations include the European Union (EU) Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS). The EU RoHS and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our products. Currently, our products comply with the EU RoHS requirements. However, it is possible that certain exemptions may be revoked in the future, including an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment upon which we and our competitors rely, and which is currently scheduled to expire in July 2016. Revocation of this exemption or further changes to this or other laws or passage of new similar laws in other jurisdictions, may require us to cease selling non-compliant products in the EU or reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. This reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us, disrupt our operations or logistics and result in an adverse impact on our operating results. Additionally, EU and China have adopted the WEEE directive, which requires producers of electrical and electronic equipment to assume responsibility for collecting, treating, recycling and disposing of products when they have reached the end of their useful life, as well as REACH regulations, which regulate handling of certain chemical substances that may be used in our products.

The traditional telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in regulations relating to the Internet telecommunications industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on IP networks, but future regulations could include sales taxes on products sold via the Internet and Internet service provider access charges. We could be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce in any country where we market equipment and services to service providers or cloud provider companies. Regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers' needs for products designed to enable a wide range of such services or business models. For instance, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering new regulations governing aspects of fixed broadband networks and wireless networks through proposals regarding net neutrality and government regulation of the Internet. These regulations and regulations resulting from these proposals might impact service provider and cloud provider business models and as such, providers' needs for Internet telecommunications equipment and services. Also, many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security, supply chain integrity, privacy and data protection, any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment.

The adoption and implementation of such regulations could reduce demand for our products, increase the cost of building and selling our products, result in product inventory write-offs, impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner and require us to spend significant time and expense to comply, and we could face fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations. Any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products or affecting products containing encryption capabilities could negatively affect our revenues.

The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the import or export of, among other things, encryption technology. Certain of our products contain or use encryption technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring certification, notifications, review of source code, or the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys. For example, Russia and China recently have implemented new requirements relating to products containing encryption and India has imposed special warranty and other obligations associated with technology deemed critical. Governmental regulation of encryption or IP networking technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, or export sanctions, including recent restrictions on exports to Russia, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues. In addition, failure to comply with such regulations could result in harm to our reputation, penalties, costs, and restrictions on import or export privileges or adversely affect sales to government agencies or government-funded projects.

Our ability to process orders and ship products in a timely manner is dependent in part on our business systems and performance of the systems and processes of third parties such as our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or other partners, as well as the interfaces between our systems and the systems of such third parties. If our systems, the systems and processes of those third parties, or the interfaces between them experience delays or fail, our business processes and our ability to build and ship products could be impacted, and our financial results could be harmed.

Some of our business processes depend upon our information technology ("IT") systems, the systems and processes of third parties, and the interfaces of our systems with the systems of third parties. For example, our order entry system feeds information into the



systems of our contract manufacturers, which enables them to build and ship our products. If those systems fail or are interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all. This could negatively impact our ability to ship products or otherwise operate our business, and our financial results could be harmed. For example, although it did not adversely affect our shipments, an earthquake in late December of 2006 disrupted our communications with China, where a significant part of our manufacturing occurs. In addition, as discussed earlier in this "Risk Factors" section, beginning in 2012 and continuing into 2015, we have been implementing major changes to our enterprise resource planning system. Any failure of the new system or interruptions during the transition may impair communications with our manufacturers, and, therefore, adversely affect our ability to build and ship our products.

We also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products. If those systems and processes experience interruption or delay, our ability to build and ship our products in a timely manner may be harmed. For example, we have experienced instances where our contract manufacturers were not able to ship products in the time periods expected by us, which prevented us from meeting our commitments to our customers. If we are not able to ship our products or if product shipments are delayed, our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner for those products would be affected and our financial results could be harmed.

Telecommunications and Cloud service provider companies and our other large customers generally require onerous terms and conditions in our contracts with them. As we seek to sell more products to such customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues.

Telecommunications and cloud service provider companies, which comprise a significant portion of our customer base, and other large companies, generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers. For example, our customers, France Telecom-Orange and Deutsche Telekom AG have formed a company for the purpose of purchasing products from, and negotiating more favorable contractual terms with, suppliers. As we seek to sell more products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions, which may include terms that affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms.

In addition, service providers have purchased products from other vendors who promised but failed to deliver certain functionality and/or had products that caused problems or outages in the networks of these customers. As a result, these customers may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we are required to agree to them, may require us to defer revenue recognition from such sales, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts, needs and opportunities, or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts, market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such technological shifts, needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all. For example, the move from traditional network infrastructures towards software-defined networking, or SDN, has been receiving considerable attention. In our view, it will take several years to see the full impact of SDN, and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine hardware and software elements. If we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to meet those requirements in a timely manner, it could cause us to lose customers, and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance.

In addition, in the past two years, we have announced new products, including the QF5100, T4000 Core Router, EX9200 Ethernet Switch, MX Series Routers, PTX 3000 Packet Transport Router, and Juniper Networks Contrail. If these or other new products do not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth, our ability to meet future financial targets and aspirations may be adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to deliver new or announced products to the market in a timely manner, it could adversely affect the market acceptance of those products and harm our competitive position and our business and financial results.



Our ability to develop, market, and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive, engineering, sales and marketing, and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas, or sales people specializing in the service provider and enterprise markets, is limited and competition for such individuals is intense. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to attract or retain personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel, engineers and sales people, and the complexity and time involved in replacing or training new employees, could delay the development and introduction of new products, and negatively impact our ability to market, sell, or support our products.

We are a party to lawsuits, investigations, proceedings, and other disputes, which are costly to defend and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions, any or all of which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We, and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our Board of Directors, have been or are subject to various lawsuits. We have been served with lawsuits related to employment matters, commercial transactions and patent infringement, as well as securities laws. As noted in Note 16,

Commitments and Contingencies

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report, under the heading of “Legal Proceedings”, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are conducting investigations into possible violations by the Company of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in a number of countries. The investigations relate to whether the Company or any third party on behalf of the Company gave money, or anything else of value to any government official in violation of the FCPA. The Company’s Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent advisors, has been investigating and conducting a thorough review of possible violations of the FCPA, and has made recommendations for remedial measures, including employee disciplinary actions in foreign jurisdictions, which the Company has implemented and continues to implement. Litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain. We therefore cannot predict the duration, scope, outcome or consequences of litigation and government investigations. In connection with any government investigations, including those in which we are currently involved as described above, if the government takes action against us or we agree to settle the matter, we may be required to pay substantial fines and incur other sanctions, which may be material, and suffer reputational harm. The lawsuits and investigations are expensive and time-consuming to defend, settle, and/or resolve, and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We are a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights, resolution of which may be time

-

consuming and expensive, as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute, defend, or make our products non-infringing.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, partners, or customers, alleging that our products or services infringe proprietary rights. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they have been and can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, and may require us to develop non-infringing technologies, enter into license agreements, or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services. Furthermore, because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief that are not necessarily predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third-party is successful, if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives.

We are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or there is a change in circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets below their carrying values. As of

December 31, 2014

, our goodwill was

$2,981.5 million

and there were no intangible assets with indefinite lives. When the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill, a charge to operations is recorded. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value, a charge to operations is recognized. Either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred.



In the fourth quarter of 2014, we rationalized our Security product portfolio, including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products, including our Junos® Pulse product. These factors decreased our short-term and near-term revenue and profitability forecasts for our Security reporting unit. During our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, the carrying value of our Security reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its fair value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million.

In recent years, economic weakness has contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks, including ours. Declines in our level of revenues due to restructuring or cost reductions or declines in our operating margins, as well as sustained declines in our stock price, increase the risk that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives may become impaired in future periods.

Our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, such as expected future cash flows, the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets, and our stock price. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. However, any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following: earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; expiration of, or lapses in, the research and development (“R&D”) tax credit laws applicable to us; transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions, including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement; costs related to intercompany restructuring; tax effects of share-based compensation; or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"), an international association of 34 countries including the U.S., is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These contemplated changes, if finalized and adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which would harm our business.

We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers, who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts. If we overestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may assess charges, or we may have liabilities for excess inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. For example, in the third quarter of 2012, our gross margins were reduced as a result of an inventory charge resulting from inventory we held in excess of forecasted demand. Conversely, because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms, and the demand for each component at a given time, and because our contract manufacturers are third-party manufacturers for numerous other companies, if we underestimate our requirements, as we did in the third quarter of 2010 with respect to certain components, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time, materials, and/or components required to produce our products, which could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues.

We are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long-term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships.

We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of which is a third-party manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, these contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long-term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is time-consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships, which includes failing to provide accurate forecasts of our requirements, or if one or more of them experiences delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations, or if we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers or contract manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be



delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management. Moreover, an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in China and other countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights which could adversely affect our ability to compete.

We generally rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology, any of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings and other competitive harm. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success.

We are subject to risks arising from our international operations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations, and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and VARs in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the United States. In addition, a portion of our R&D and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the United States. In some countries, we may experience reduced intellectual property protection.

As a result of our international operations, we are affected by economic, business regulatory, social, and political conditions in foreign countries, including the following:

•

changes in general IT spending,

•

the imposition of government controls, inclusive of critical infrastructure protection;

•

changes or limitations in trade protection laws or other regulatory requirements, which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries;

•

varying and potentially conflicting regulations;

•

fluctuations in local economies;

•

wage inflation or a tightening of the labor market; and

•

the impact of the following on service provider and government spending patterns: political considerations, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws, natural disasters, epidemic disease, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions, misappropriation of intellectual property, military actions, acts of terrorism, political and social unrest and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.

Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the United States or in other countries in which we operate. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, channel partners, and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners, or agents could result in termination of our relationship,



financial reporting problems, fines, and/or penalties for us, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in non-U.S. currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

The majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in U.S. Dollars. We also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen related to our sales and service operations outside of the United States. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States in which we sell in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies.

Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. However, such attempts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations are costly and no amount of hedging can be effective against all circumstances, including long-term declines in the value of the U.S. Dollar. If our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful, or if long-term declines in the value of the U.S. Dollar persist, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Integration of acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders.

We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to enhance our business. For example, in 2014, we acquired WANDL, Inc. and in 2012, we acquired Contrail Systems Inc. ("Contrail") and Mykonos Software, Inc. ("Mykonos"). Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and liabilities, diversion of management's attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, and potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired business. If we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources practices, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.

In connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders, use a substantial portion of our cash resources, assume liabilities, record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.

The divestiture of our Junos Pulse product portfolio could disrupt our business and may not yield the intended benefits.

We recently completed the sale of our Junos Pulse product portfolio to an affiliate of Siris Capital, a private equity firm, for total consideration of

$230.7 million

, of which

$105.7 million

was in cash, net of a

$19.3 million

working capital adjustment, and

$125.0 million

was in the form of an 18-month non-contingent interest bearing promissory note issued to the Company. Since approximately

$125.0 million

of the transaction consideration is in the form of an 18-month non-contingent seller promissory note, there is also the risk that we may not receive the amount owed to us by the buyer under the note and that instead the Junos Pulse assets will return to us.

If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected.

Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process. We will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our



reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future. If we fail to effectively implement improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected.

Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected defects errors or malware or do not meet customer quality expectations, our business could be adversely affected, and we may be subject to additional costs or lawsuits or be required to pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services.

Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks, and, in the case of our security products, provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information. Our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors, defects, malware, or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by end-customers. Any errors, defects, malware or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in monetary penalties, loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, loss of future business and reputation, penalties, and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, in the event an error, defect, malware, or vulnerability is attributable to a component supplied by a third-party vendor, we may not be able to recover from the vendor all of the costs of remediation that we may incur. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty or indemnification. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention. If our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate, or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Moreover, if our products fail to satisfy our customers' quality expectations for whatever reason, the perception of and the demand for our products could be adversely affected.

If our products do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.

Our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers’ networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation, and seriously harm our business and prospects.

Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology, and if licenses of third-party technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us, our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected.

We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third-parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. The failure to comply with the terms of any license, including free open source software, may result in our inability to continue to use such license. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements, could require us, if possible, to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and IP infrastructure, and if the demand for network and IP systems does not continue to grow, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure IP infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of IP services. As a result of changes in the economy, capital spending or the building of network capacity in excess of demand, all of which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers, spending on IP infrastructure can vary, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build-out of their next generation networks. During the decision-making period when our customers are determining the design of those



networks and the selection of the equipment they will use in those networks, such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure IP infrastructure. Such delays in purchases can make it more difficult to predict revenues from such customers can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by these customers and, even where our products are ultimately selected, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception, our stock price and cause us to incur additional expense.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We have and will continue to incur significant expenses and devote management resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that, our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions may be adversely affected if our financial statements are not reliable and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.

Failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.

The major credit rating agencies routinely evaluate our indebtedness. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.

We may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

In February 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and in March 2011, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the “Senior Notes” and together with the 2024 Notes, the “Notes”), and (see discussion in Note 10, Long-Term Debt and Financing, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report). As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

$1,349.0 million

in outstanding long-term debt. In June 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year $500.0 million unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, with an option to increase the credit facility, up to a maximum of $700.0 million. The Credit Agreement will terminate in June 2019, at which point all amounts borrowed must be repaid. As of

December 31, 2014

, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility (if drawn upon) or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations, refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Based upon current levels of operations, we believe cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility (if drawn upon). However, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt (including the Notes) or obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

The indentures that govern the Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:

•

incur liens;

•

incur sale and leaseback transactions; and

•

consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.



The Credit Agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following:

•

maintenance of a leverage ratio no greater than 3.0x and an interest coverage ratio no less than 3.0x

•

covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, change their accounting or reporting policies, change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type.

As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business. A failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with these covenants to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments, including those under the Senior Notes, any notes issued in connection with the recently-announced capital return program discussed above and the Revolving Credit Facility (if drawn upon).

Our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.

In October 2014, we announced a cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock payable on December 23, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 2, 2014. Our ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to, among other things, our financial position and results of operations, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements and other factors. Any failure to pay or increase future dividends as announced, reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.

In addition, our Board of Directors recently authorized a $1.1 billion increase to our current capital return plan, which includes a planned $1.5 billion of share repurchases before the end of the second quarter of 2015. The capital return plan will be funded by a combination of onshore cash, previously issued debt and potentially, additional debt financing, to preserve our financial flexibility to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Any failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our shareholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.

The investment of our cash balance and our investments in government and corporate debt securities are subject to risks, which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.

At

December 31, 2014

, we had

$1,639.6 million

in cash and cash equivalents and

$1,465.3 million

in short- and long-term investments. We have invested these amounts primarily in asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, foreign government debt securities, government- sponsored enterprise obligations, money market funds, mutual funds, publicly-traded equity securities, time deposits and U.S. government securities. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, sovereign debt, and interest rate risks. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Uninsured losses could harm our operating results.

We self-insure against many business risks and expenses, such as intellectual property litigation and our medical benefit programs, where we believe we can adequately self-insure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed cost-effective or is not available. We also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty, and other risks. We place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location, depending on availability, cost, and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles, policy limits, and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

ITEM 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes in Item 8, of this Report.

The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. For further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section included in this “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.

Business and Market Environment

At Juniper Networks, we design, develop, and sell products and services for high-performance networks to enable customers to build highly scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility, efficiency and value through automation. We focus on customers and partners across our key verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their business; including global service providers, enterprises, financial services, cloud hosting providers, governments, research, and public sector organizations. Product and solution differentiation, with a relentless customer focus, will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenue faster than the market.

We sell our products in more than 100 countries in three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia Pacific ("APAC"). We sell our high-performance routing, switching, and security network products and service offerings to service provider and enterprise markets. Our silicon, systems, and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking, helping customers achieve superior performance, greater choice, and flexibility, while reducing overall total cost of ownership. In addition to our products, we offer technical support and professional services, as well as education and training programs to our customers. Together, our high-performance product and service offerings help our customers convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation, value, and increased performance, reliability, and security to end-users.

During 2014, we saw a slight decline in net revenues year-over-year, primarily due to reduced spending by U.S. Carriers, however the diversity in our business across verticals such as Cloud and Cable Providers helped to partially offset the decline. We expect the overall revenue environment to be challenging over the next several quarters, as market dynamics, including consolidation, are impacting demand from our largest U.S. service provider customers. We believe our product gross margins may continue to vary in the future due to competitive pricing pressures, which may be offset by additional operational efficiencies. Nevertheless, we are focused on executing our strategy that is focused on designing, developing and selling products and services for high-performance networks. We believe our product portfolio continues to be strong, and we remain focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives.

In 2014, we continued to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio, which resulted in new product offerings across routing, switching, and security. In routing, we announced a virtualized version of our flagship MX Series 3D Universal Edge Routing platform, the vMX 3D Universal Edge Router, to deliver the industry's first full-featured, carrier-grade virtualized router, giving service providers and enterprises the ability to seamlessly leverage the benefits of both virtual and physical networking. In switching, to address the networking requirements of large cloud providers and enterprise customers who build large and massive scale data centers, we announced OCX1100, the first switch to combine Open Compute Project (OCP) hardware design with a carrier-class network operating system, Junos OS. We also announced a new line of EX4600 Ethernet switches to fulfill the increasing demands for highly available access to cloud services and applications across enterprise campus networks.

Additionally, we expanded our SDN portfolio with new software and hardware, including the NorthStar Controller, a new traffic-engineering controller leveraging open, industry-standard protocols built to optimize service providers’ transport networks, as well as the Junos Fusion software that controls thousands of independent network elements from a single management plane.



Key strategic technology partnerships also delivered new solutions to address the high-performance network requirements of our service provider and enterprise customers. Through integration with Gainspeed’s technology and our MX Series 3D Universal Edge Routers and EX Series Switches, we announced the Virtual Converged Cable Access Platform, allowing cable operators to better automate and scale their edge/access infrastructure while creating a platform for new cloud-based services. Additionally, we partnered with Nokia to advance the Telco Cloud for mobile broadband and accelerate service creation by bringing together Nokia's leading Liquid Core solution and the Juniper Networks MetaFabric™ data center architecture, including Contrail. Furthermore, we signed a go to market agreement with Aruba to deliver an open, converged enterprise network solution by integrating Aruba mobility solutions with Juniper enterprise switches and routers, delivering ongoing product innovation to enterprise customers.

For security, we announced Firefly Perimeter a virtual version of our SRX Series Service Gateway, new advancements in our Spotlight Secure threat intelligence platform, Junos Space Virtual Director, an application that automates the management and deployment of Firefly Perimeter, as well as Juniper Argon Secure, an advanced anti-malware service.

Due to the recent underperformance of our security products and efforts to refocus our security offerings, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. We intend to focus on stabilizing revenues in our security reporting unit in 2015, and, as a result, we are pivoting our security strategy to focus on building integrated solutions that focus on network resiliency and business continuity across cloud, data center, branch, campus, and service provider mobile infrastructure, by taking advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation of our Junos-based SRX platform.

In 2014, we implemented a series of initiatives designed to streamline our organization, improve operational efficiencies, rationalize our product portfolios, and return capital to our shareholders. These actions were largely completed by the end of 2014.

In the first quarter of 2014, we realigned our organization into a One-Juniper structure, which included consolidating each of our research and development ("R&D") and go-to-market functions to reduce complexity, increase clarity of responsibilities, and improve efficiency.

To improve operational efficiency, in 2014, we implemented various restructuring activities and structural cost saving actions across research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. We completed the 2014 restructuring plan through workforce reductions, facility consolidations or closures, asset write-downs, contract terminations and other actions. As a result, we recorded a total restructuring charge of

$207.7 million

in cost of sales and restructuring and other charges. In connection with the rationalization of our product portfolio, we completed the sale of Junos Pulse for total consideration of

$230.7 million

which resulted in a gain of

$19.6 million

in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result of these cost management actions, we achieved our total annualized operating expense savings commitment of $260.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.

In addition to these cost reduction activities, we introduced a capital allocation program to return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. In 2014, we returned $2.3 billion of capital to our stockholders through the completion of a $1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program ("ASR") and the repurchase of $1.1 billion of our common stock subsequent to the ASR. We also paid two quarterly cash dividends of

$0.10

per share for an aggregate amount of

$86.0 million

and issued

$350.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.50%

senior notes due 2024 ("2024 Notes"), which allowed us to partially fund the ASR. We intend to return $1.0 billion of aggregate share repurchases by the end of the second quarter of 2015 subject to raising additional debt financing.



Financial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview

The following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended December 31,


,


, and


(in millions, except per share amounts, percentages, days sales outstanding ("DSO"), and book-to-bill):

________________________________

(*)

DSO and book-to-bill are for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.

•

Net Revenues:

During 2014, net revenues were slightly down, compared to 2013, as a result of a decline in net revenues from US carriers, partially offset by growing demand from cloud providers in the Americas, as well as improving demand among service provider in EMEA. The year-over-year decline in our net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues from our routing and security products, partially offset by an increase in our switching products revenue and service revenue.

During 2013, compared to 2012, we experienced net revenue growth in the Americas, in both service provider and enterprise, offset by a decline in revenue in APAC and EMEA. The year-over-year increase in our net revenues during 2013 was primarily due to increases in edge routing, switching, and service revenue, partially offset by a decline in our security products revenue.

•

Gross Margin:

Our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased during 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of higher inventory charges driven by product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 Restructuring Plan and charges related to an industry-wide memory product quality defect for a component from a third party supplier.

During 2013, compared to 2012, our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2012, partially offset by higher inventory provisions in 2013 for legacy platforms.

•

Operating (Loss) Income:

During 2014, compared to 2013, we experienced a decline in operating (loss) income as a percentage of net revenues, primarily due to an

$850.0 million

goodwill impairment charge related to the Security reporting



unit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014, restructuring and other charges of

$207.7 million

, related to severance, facility consolidations and closures, asset-write-offs, and contract terminations in connection with our 2014 Restructuring Plan, as well as a component remediation charge of $20.7 million relating to the memory product quality defect.

Our operating income as a percentage of revenues increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to growth in net revenues. Also contributing to the increase in operating income were lower restructuring and other charges of $52.2 million compared to 2012.

•

Cash Dividends Declared per Common Stock:

During 2014, we declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share, payable on September 23, 2014 and on December 23, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 2, 2014 and December 2, 2014, respectively, in the aggregate amount of

$86.0 million

. We had not previously paid cash dividends.

•

Stock Repurchase Plan Activity:

Under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased approximately

96.1 million

shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of

$23.41

per share for an aggregate purchase of

$2,250.0 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2014

.

•

Operating Cash Flows:

Operating cash flows decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower cash collections from customers, higher payments primarily related to our 2014 restructuring plans, higher taxes paid, and lower prepayments compared to prior year.

Operating cash flows increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to the timing of payments to our vendors, higher deferred revenue, and lower taxes paid, partially offset by the timing of payments for incentive compensation to our employees and the timing of receipts from our customers.

•

DSO:

DSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. DSO for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 increased by


days, or

20%

compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2013. During 2014, we transitioned certain distribution partners from a third party financing program to Juniper's commercial payment terms. Going forward, we expect DSO to be in the range of 45 to 55 days.

DSO increased by 6 days or 17% for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily due to large multi-year service renewals at the end of the period which increased our outstanding receivables compared to the same period in 2012.

Deferred Revenue:

Total deferred revenue increased slightly by

$6.4 million

to

$1,075.7 million

as of December 31, 2014, compared to

$1,069.3 million

as of

December 31, 2013

, primarily due to an increase in deferred service revenue of $25.8 million, primarily driven by the execution of several multi-year support agreements and annual agreement renewals. The increase in deferred service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in deferred product revenue of

$19.4 million

as a result of lower distributor inventory and multiple revenue releases in relation to previously deferred product revenue.

As of December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012, total deferred revenue increased by

$145.9 million

, primarily due to an increase in deferred service revenue driven by the execution of several multi-year support agreements, and to a lesser extent an increase in annual agreement renewals, slightly offset by a decrease in deferred product revenue.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of share-based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For further information about our significant accounting policies, see Note 2,



Significant Accounting Policies

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operations may be affected.

Goodwill.

We make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.

Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination or an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recorded. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of November 1

st

, or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment level, by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component.

The provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. While we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units.

Our goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. The first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units with the reporting unit’s net asset values. If the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting units does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit’s fair value to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities, using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance, to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill, and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference.

In the first step, the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches. We believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit’s fair value. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business. In the application of the income and market valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.



Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, and then apply a control premium which is determined by considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units. The income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit.

Prior to the second step, the long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. If needed, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.

In the second step, the reporting unit's fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets; such as, existing technology, backlog, and customer relationships, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. Assumptions used in measuring the fair value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates, customer renewal rates, and technology obsolescence rates used in valuing intangible assets, and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets.

During our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, our reporting units were: Routing, Switching and Security.

The fair value of the Routing and Switching reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value. However the fair value of the Security reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value and therefore we determined the Security reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired. In 2014, we re-aligned our go-to-market and research and development resources on projects with the highest potential for growth and continued to leverage our engineering efforts across our Routing, Switching, and Security products. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to implement a new Security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the SRX platform. As a result, we rationalized our Security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products, including the divestiture of Junos Pulse. These factors decreased our short-term and near-term revenue and profitability forecasts of the Security reporting unit.

As a result, the carrying value of the Security reporting unit's goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of

$850.0 million

which was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Refer to Item 8 of Part II, Note 7, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets, of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information.

Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer Liabilities.

Inventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and is stated at lower of average cost or market. A provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. In determining the provision, we also consider estimated recovery rates based on the nature of the inventory. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our inventory balances were

$62.5 million

and

$52.7 million

, respectively.

We establish a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders. We also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our contract manufacturer liabilities were

$25.3 million

and $22.9 million, respectively.

Significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand, recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory, and obsolete material exposures. We perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence



because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and contract manufacturer liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities. Inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times.

•

Revenue recognition.

Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. Changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.

Under our revenue recognition policies, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (“ESP”) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. We do not use TPE as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors' products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. ESP is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles. When determining ESP, we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years.

•

Income Taxes.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. In addition, OECD’s contemplated changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, if finalized and adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.



•

Loss Contingencies.

We use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2,

Results of Operations

The following table presents product and service net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

2014 Compared to 2013

Routing product net revenues decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of weaker demand for core routing, partially offset by strong growth of our PTX series products. Edge routing net revenues increased as a result of strong demand for our MX series products, partly offset by older edge routing platforms. The year-over year decline was driven by weakness from large US carriers, partially offset by strength from Cloud Providers.

Switching product net revenues increased in 2014, compared to 2013, reflecting growth from both our QFabric system and our EX series products. During the year we saw strong adoption of QFabric data center switches by a growing number of customers, with especially strong demand from Cloud Providers in the Americas.

Security product net revenues decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a continuing decline in our legacy Screen OS products and the divestiture of our Junos Pulse product lines. Sales of our SRX platform declined slightly year-over-year, due to lower demand from U.S. Carrier customers.

The increase in service revenue in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals. Service revenues are largely correlated with product revenues, therefore if product net revenues decline, it can have an impact on future service revenues.



2013 Compared to 2012

Routing product net revenues increased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to an increase in volume of sales of our edge routing products to both service provider and enterprise customers reflecting customer demand for the MX platform in particular.

Switching product net revenues increased in 2013, compared to 2012, as a result of an increase in EX and QFabric product lines for both service provider and enterprise markets. Also contributing to the increase in net revenues were new product introductions for the enterprise campus and data center infrastructure.

Security product net revenues decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to a decline in legacy Screen OS and our SRX platform.

The increase in service revenue in 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily driven by strong contract renewals from our installed base across routing, switching and security products.

Net Revenues by Geographic Region

The following table presents net revenues by geographic region (in millions, except percentages):

2014 Compared to 2013

The increase in net revenues in the Americas in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from service provider markets, partially offset by a decline in the enterprise market. The increase in net revenues in the service provider market was due to strong demand from cloud and cable providers, partially offset by a decrease in demand from carriers. The decline in the enterprise market resulted from a decline in net revenues due to recognition of revenue from a large U.S. federal government contract in 2013.

Net revenues in EMEA slightly increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to stronger demand from service providers partially offset by a decrease in net revenues from the enterprise market, although demand from the public sector remained strong.

Net revenues in APAC decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise market.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net revenues in the Americas increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets. The increase in service provider revenues was due to an increase in sales to cloud providers and cable providers, partially offset by a slight decrease in sales to carriers. The increase in enterprise revenues in 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily attributable to a broad-based improvement in customer demand as well as the recognition of a large U.S. federal government contract.



Net revenues in EMEA decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to a decline in revenues in the enterprise market attributable to certain large sales in 2012.

Net revenues in APAC decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to lower revenues in enterprise resulting from weaker conditions in the China enterprise market. Service provider revenues were relatively flat as a decline in sales with certain large service providers in Japan were offset by higher revenue with certain large carriers in China. Additionally, the recognition of revenue from a large service provider in Singapore was offset by declines in revenues from other service providers in APAC.

Net Revenues by Market and Customer

The following table presents net revenues by market (in millions, except percentages):

We sell our high-performance routing, switching, and security network products and service offerings to two primary markets: service provider and enterprise. Determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customer's industrial classification code, but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product. The service provider market generally includes wireline and wireless carriers, and cable operators, as well as major Internet content and application providers, including those that provide social networking and search engine services. The enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses; federal, state, and local governments; research and education institutions; and financial services.

2014 Compared to 2013

Net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in 2014, compared to 2013, with growth in the Americas and EMEA. The increase in service provider net revenues in the Americas was driven by increased revenues from cloud and cable providers, partially offset by decreased revenues from large carriers. The increase in service provider net revenues in EMEA was attributable to growth with large carriers, while in APAC net revenues in the service provider market declined as a result of lower demand with both small and large carriers. In addition, service provider demand for switching products continued to be strong.

Net revenues from sales to the enterprise market decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in sales in all geographic regions, however, revenue demand from public sector customers was higher for all three regions.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in sales to cloud providers and cable providers in the Americas, partially offset by a slight decrease in sales to wireless carriers, while the service provider market in EMEA and APAC was relatively flat. In addition, service provider demand for switching and data center solutions in 2013 was stronger than in 2012.

Net revenues from the enterprise market increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to broad-based growth in the Americas enterprise market, as well as recognition of a large U.S. federal government contract, partially offset by weaker demand in APAC and EMEA.

Customer

No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during the year ended

December 31, 2014

and 2013. During the year ended

December 31, 2012

, Verizon accounted for

10.3%

of our net revenues.



Gross Margins

The following table presents gross margins (in millions, except percentages):

2014 Compared to 2013

Product gross margin decreased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in cost of revenues. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to asset write-downs of $41.5 million for product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 Restructuring Plan and $20.7 million in connection with an industry-wide memory product quality defect in a component from a third-party supplier. Excluding the costs of the restructuring and component defect, product gross margin as a percentage of net revenues improved slightly primarily due to the favorability in product mix in the 2014 period.

Service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues decreased slightly in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in labor and logistics delivery costs to support new contracts and product introductions.

2013 Compared to 2012

Product gross margin percentage increased slightly in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2012, partially offset by higher inventory provisions in 2013 for legacy platforms. Product gross margin benefited from cost reductions in the supply chain in 2013, which more than offset the impact of higher pricing discounts.

Service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher service revenues and greater efficiency in the delivery of services.



Operating Expenses

The following table presents operating expenses (in millions, except percentages):

Our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnel-related costs, including wages, commissions, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation, and travel, particularly with respect to research and development and sales and marketing activities. Facility and information technology (“IT”) departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount. Facility and IT related headcount was 366, 396, and 368, as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. We had a total of 8,806, 9,483, and 9,234, employees as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

2014 Compared to 2013

Research and development

Research and development expense decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses as a result of restructuring actions and divestiture of our Junos Pulse product lines. Research and development headcount decreased 8% from 4,135 as of December 31, 2013 to 3,797 as of December 31, 2014. The decrease in research and development personnel expense was partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of WANDL, Inc. in the first quarter, and engineering program costs in 2014, compared to 2013.

Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expense decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses and other discretionary expenses due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities. The decrease in personnel-related expenses is primarily due to headcount reductions. Sales and marketing headcount decreased 11% from 2,626 as of December 31, 2013 to 2,348 as of December 31, 2014.

General and administrative

General and administrative expense increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in the current period in connection with investigation into possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and, to a lesser extent, our patent litigation case with Palo Alto Networks, Inc. ("PAN"), as well as other litigation matters. This increase was partially offset by personnel-related expenses as a result of headcount reductions of 8% from 513 as of December 31, 2013 to 470 as of December 31, 2014. Our patent litigation with PAN was settled in 2014.

Restructuring and other charges

Restructuring and other charges increased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 Restructuring Plan. During 2014, we implemented the 2014 Restructuring Plan and incurred restructuring charges of $166.2 million related to workforce reductions, contract terminations, project cancellations, and facility closures. The 2014



Restructuring Plan has been substantially completed as of December 31, 2014 and we do not expect to record significant future charges. See Note 9, Restructuring and Other Charges, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for further discussion of our restructuring activities.

Impairment of goodwill

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to implement a new security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the SRX platform. As a result, we rationalized our Security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products, including the divestiture of Junos Pulse. These factors decreased our short term and near term revenue and profitability forecasts of the security reporting unit. During our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, the carrying value of our security reporting unit's goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of

$850.0 million

which was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in Part II Item 8 of this report. See Note 7, Goodwill and Purchased Intangibles, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for further discussion on the impairment of goodwill.

2013 Compared to 2012

Research and development

Research and development expense decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to lower depreciation expense of $28.3 million attributable to the extended useful lives of computers and equipment in 2013 as well as lower prototype development costs of $18.6 million. In addition, outside services, facilities, and IT costs decreased related to the cancellation of certain projects and facility closures. The decrease in research and development expense was partially offset by increases in personnel-related expenses primarily attributable to higher share-based compensation expense, and to a lesser extent, higher variable compensation. Research and development headcount increased 1% from 4,081 as of December 31, 2012 to 4,135 as of December 31, 2013. Additionally, we continued to shift headcount to lower cost regions.

Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expense increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses related to an increase in commission expense driven by improved sales achievement, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and lower outside service and travel due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities. Sales and marketing headcount decreased 2% from 2,680 as of December 31, 2012 to 2,626 as of December 31, 2013 as a result of our restructuring activities.

General and administrative

General and administrative expense increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher litigation costs. The increase in general and administrative expense was partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses, primarily share-based compensation expense. General and administrative headcount increased 6% from 486 as of December 31, 2012 to 513 as of December 31, 2013 to support our finance-related initiatives, including our ERP implementation.

Restructuring and other charges

Restructuring and other charges decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to higher charges recorded in 2012 in connection with our 2012 Restructuring Plan. During 2013, we implemented the 2013 Restructuring Plan and incurred restructuring charges of $39.1 million related to workforce reductions, contract terminations, project cancellations, and facility closures in connection with our plans. See Note 9,

Restructuring and Other Charges

,

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for further discussion of our restructuring activities.



Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense associated with equity incentive awards ("awards"), which include stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), restricted stock awards ("RSAs") and performance share awards ("PSAs"), as well as our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") was recorded in the following cost and expense categories (in millions, except percentages):

2014 Compared to 2013

Share-based compensation expense remained consistent in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase in expense related to RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs assumed in connection with our acquisition of WANDL in 2014 and the increase in grant date fair values due to higher stock prices was offset by a decrease in actual shares vested.

2013 Compared to 2012

Share-based compensation expense remained consistent in 2013, compared to 2012. Offsetting increases in expense related to RSAs assumed in connection with our acquisition of Contrail at the end of 2012 were decreases in actual shares vested and a decline in grant date fair values due to our lower stock prices.

Other Income (Expense), Net and Income Tax Provision

The following table presents other income (expense), net and income tax provision (in millions, except percentages):

Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest income primarily includes interest income from our cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Interest expense

primarily includes interest, net of capitalized interest expense from our long-term debt and customer financing arrangements. Other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other non-operational income and expense items.



2014 Compared to 2013

Interest Income

Interest income increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to the issuance of our 2024 Notes in the first quarter of 2014. See Note 10,

Long-Term Debt and Financing

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in Part II of this report for additional information regarding our 2024 Notes.

Gain on Legal Settlement

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we entered into a settlement agreement with PAN resolving patent litigation between the two companies, which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of

$196.1 million

, net of legal fees.

Gain on Investments

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we recorded a gain of

$163.0 million

, primarily related to the sale of investments which were converted from privately-held investments to publicly-traded equity upon IPO and subsequently sold. During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, net gain on investments was primarily comprised of a gain of

$7.1 million

related to the Company's privately-held investments and publicly traded-equity investments.

Gain on Sale of Junos Pulse

The sale of our Junos Pulse product portfolio was completed on October 1, 2014 and we recorded a gain of

$19.6 million

in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. This sale was driven by product rationalization in connection with our initiative to focus on projects with the highest potential for growth. See Note 8. Other Financial Information, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion on the sale Junos Pulse.

2013 Compared to 2012

Interest Income

Interest income decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to lower cash balances and interest rates, as well as a shift to certain investments yielding lower interest.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2012 resulting from our phased Sunnyvale campus build-out.

Gain on Investments

Gain on investments decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to higher net gains recorded in 2012 related to our privately-held investments which included a

$14.7 million

gain from the acquisition of our privately-held investment in Contrail.

Income Tax Provision

The effective rate for 2014 differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the non-deductible goodwill charge and tax gain on sale of Junos Pulse offset by the benefit from release of the Company’s valuation allowance attributable to investment losses, the federal R&D credit, recognition of domestic production activities deductions, and earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. The passage of Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 on December 19, 2014 retroactively reinstated the U.S. federal R&D tax credit from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014

.



The effective rate for 2013 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the benefit of the federal R&D credit, a tax settlement with the IRS, recognition of domestic production activities deductions, and earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates.

The effective tax rate for 2012 was substantially similar to the federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective rate for 2012 does not reflect the benefit of the federal R&D credit which expired on December 31, 2011.

Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. As a result of the expiration of the federal research and development credit on December 31, 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to increase in 2015 See Item1A of Part I, "Risk Factors" of this Report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results.

For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see Note 14,

Income Taxes

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities, the issuance of our common stock, and the issuance of our long-term debt. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions, except percentages):

The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and short-term deferred revenue. Working capital decreased by

$818.3 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2014

, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of our stock repurchase activities, tax payments, dividends, and purchase of capital equipment, as well as a decline in short term investments.

Summary of Cash Flows

As of

December 31, 2014

, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by

$644.4 million

from

December 31, 2013

primarily due to purchases and retirement of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program, capital expenditures, federal estimated tax payment, dividend payout and higher payments related to all restructuring plans, partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 Notes in February 2014, cash received from the sale of certain equity investments, cash received from the patent litigation settlement, and proceeds from the sale of Junos Pulse.

The following table summarizes cash flows from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in millions, except percentages):



Operating Activities

2014 Compared to 2013

Cash flow from operations decreased by $82.5 million in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower cash collections from customers, higher payments related to our restructuring plans, higher taxes paid, and lower prepayments compared to prior year.

2013 Compared to 2012

Cash flows from operations increased by

$208.2 million

in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher net income, the timing of payments to our vendors, higher deferred revenue, and lower taxes paid, partially offset by the timing of payments for incentive compensation to our employees and the timing of collections on our outstanding receivables.

Investing Activities

2014 Compared to 2013

Net cash provided by investing was $434.0 million in 2014, compared to net cash used in investing of $561.0 million in 2013. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to higher proceeds from sale of investments and fewer purchases of investments, as well as proceeds received from the sale of Junos Pulse.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by

$34.6 million

in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to lower spending on acquisitions and asset purchases as well as lower capital expenditures as we completed our phased Sunnyvale campus build-out, partially offset by higher purchases of investments.

Financing Activities

2014 Compared to 2013

Net cash used in financing activities increased by $1,422.5 million in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to purchases and retirement of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 Notes.

2013 Compared to 2012

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by

$146.6 million

in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to lower purchases and retirement of our common stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises as well as proceeds from customer financing arrangements.

Stock Repurchase Activities

In February 2014, the Board approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to

$2.1 billion

of our common stock ("2014 Stock Repurchase Program"). In October 2014, the Board authorized a

$1.3 billion

increase to the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program for a total of $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2014, there was

$1.2 billion

of authorized funds remaining under the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program. We intend to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock by the end of the second quarter of 2015 as part of our three year capital return program, subject to raising additional debt financing. Future share repurchases will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. Our stock repurchase programs may be discontinued at any time.



The following table summarizes our stock repurchase activities (in millions, except per share amounts):

_______________________________

(1)

As part of the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the "ASR") with

two

financial institutions to repurchase

$1.2 billion

of our common stock. We made an up-front payment of

$1.2 billion

pursuant to the ASR to repurchase our common stock. The aggregate number of shares ultimately purchased was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount. The shares received with respect to the ASR have been retired. Retired shares return to authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

Dividends

On July 22, 2014, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.10

per share of our common stock, or

$43.8 million

in the aggregate, to stockholders of record on September 2, 2014 which was paid on September 23, 2014. On October 23, 2014, we declared a cash dividend of

$0.10

per share of common stock, or $42.2 million, on December 23, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 2, 2014. Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by our Board or an authorized committee thereof. See Note 18,

Subsequent Events

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion on our dividend declaration subsequent to

December 31, 2014

.

Restructuring

As of

December 31, 2014

, our restructuring liability was

$17.0 million

of which

$9.4 million

is related to severance, which are expected to be paid in full by the first quarter of 2015,

$7.4 million

related to facility closures, expected to be paid through March 2018, and

$0.2 million

related to contract and other charges. See Note 9,

Restructuring and Other Charge

s, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion on our restructuring plans.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to end-users, undelivered product commitments, and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria. Deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue. Deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services, which include technical support, hardware and software maintenance, professional services, and training.

The following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues (in millions):



As of

December 31, 2014

, net deferred product revenue decreased

$19.4 million

to

$225.6 million

, compared to

$245.0 million

as of

December 31, 2013

, as a result of lower distributor inventory and multiple revenue releases in relation to previously deferred product revenue. As of

December 31, 2014

, the increase in deferred service revenue of

$25.8 million

attributed to the execution of several multi-year support agreements, and an increase in annual agreement renewals.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of

December 31, 2014

and


, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, customs and duties guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. See "Guarantees" below and Note 16,

Commitments and Contingencies

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our guarantees.

Contractual Obligations

Our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, debt, and other contractual obligations. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2014

and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions):

(1)

See Note 16,

Commitments and Contingencies,

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.

(2)

See Note 10,

Long-Term Debt and Financing,

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information regarding our debt.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

$177.5 million

included in long-term income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for unrecognized tax positions.

At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the table above.

Revolving Credit Facility

On June 27, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year

$500.0 million

unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional

$200.0 million

, subject to certain conditions. Proceeds from borrowing made under the Credit Agreement may be used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 27, 2019, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. We will pay to each lender a facility fee on a quarterly basis based on the amount of each lender's commitment to make loans, of between 0.100% and 0.250% depending on our public debt rating. Revolving loans may be prepaid without penalty, subject to customary breakage costs for loans bearing interest at the Eurocurrency rate. We are also obligated to pay customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type.

The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that, include among other things, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events involving the Company or its material subsidiaries, material judgments, change of control and certain ERISA events. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement.



A default interest rate shall apply, at the request of the required lenders, on all obligations during a payment event of default under the Credit Agreement at a rate per annum equal to 2.000% above the applicable interest rate.

The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than

3.0

x and an interest coverage ratio no less than

3.0

x during the term of the credit facility. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, change their accounting or reporting policies, change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement, and no amounts were outstanding. See Note 10,

Long-term Debt and Financing

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.

Guarantees

We have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. We also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, custom and duty guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. Under certain third-party customer financing arrangements that contain guarantee provisions, which have terms of up to four years, we are liable for the aggregate unpaid payments to the third-party financing company in the event of customer default. As of

December 31, 2014

, we have not made any payments under these arrangements. As of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, we had

$26.2 million

and

$40.1 million

, respectively, in financing guarantees, bank guarantees, and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees of which

$22.2 million

in financing guarantees was recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2014

.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future. Additionally, in 2014, we indicated that we intend to return $4.1 billion to our stockholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends from February 2014 through the end of 2016. To the extent we repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or pay cash dividends on our common stock, our liquidity may be impacted.

In August 2013, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC enabling us to offer for sale, from time to time, an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions. Our 2024 Notes were issued under the automatic shelf registration statement which was issued pursuant to a prospectus filed with the SEC on February 28, 2014. Any other offerings of securities under the automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus. In addition, the revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs.

We have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of our common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant. Our intention for 2014 was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 2.50% or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis (where each option, RSU, RSA or PSA granted is counted as one share). Based upon shares underlying options, RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs granted during 2014, we were at or below this target.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations, planned stock repurchases and dividends, and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months. We believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including, but not limited to:

•

level and mix of our product, sales, and gross profit margins;

•

our business, product, capital expenditures and R&D plans;

•

repurchases of our common stock;



•

payment of dividends;

•

incurrence and repayment of debt and related interest obligations;

•

litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar items related to resolution of tax audits;

•

volume price discounts and customer rebates;

•

accounts receivable levels that we maintain;

•

acquisitions and/or funding of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies;

•

changes in our compensation policies;

•

capital improvements for new and existing facilities;

•

technological advances;

•

our competitors' responses to our products and/or pricing;

•

our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers;

•

possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories;

•

expenses related to future restructuring plans;

•

tax expense associated with share-based awards;

•

issuance of share-based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years;

•

level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and

•

general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties.



ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. The value of our investments is subject to market price volatility. In addition, as of

December 31, 2014

, 85% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held outside of the U.S., which may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated. Our marketable securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These investments are also reviewed to identify and evaluate indications of potential other-than-temporary impairments as discussed in Note 4,

Cash Equivalents and Investments,

in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.

At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. We recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, related to the sales of certain investments.

The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our available-for-sale fixed income securities held as of

December 31, 2014

and


that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions):

These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate.

Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less.

Our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Approximately 78% of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and/or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by non-U.S. Dollar denominated operating expense and costs. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the hedged transaction relates. We record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


,



respectively, in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was a reduction to operating expenses of 2.1% in


, and an increase of 0.8%, and 1.5% in


, and


, respectively.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of

December 31, 2014

and as of

December 31, 2013

, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of non-U.S. dollar cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10% movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, respectively. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars as of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

by less than 1.2%.

Equity Price Risk

Our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities and our non-qualified deferred compensation (“NQDC”) plan, which may also hold publicly-traded equity securities, are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates.

We do not purchase our publicly-traded equity securities, classified as available-for-sale securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, for speculative purposes. As of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities had an estimated fair value of

$2.0 million

and

$114.6 million

, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly-traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair value of $0.7 million and $34.5 million as of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, respectively.

Investments under the NQDC plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, the total investments under our NQDC plan were

$16.3 million

and

$15.4 million

, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change on the total investments under the NQDC plan would result in a loss in the fair value of $4.9 million and $4.6 million as of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, respectively.

We have also invested in privately-held companies. Depending on the nature of these investments, some can be carried at cost and others can be carried at fair value. In


,


, and


we recorded impairment charges of

$1.1 million

,

$2.8 million

, and

$20.0 million

, respectively, on our investments in privately-held companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in Note 5,

Fair Value Measurements

, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately-held companies was

$89.9 million

and

$57.2 million

as of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, respectively.

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. as of

December 31, 2014

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2014

. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above, present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Juniper Networks, Inc., at

December 31, 2014

and


, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2014

, in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Juniper Networks, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Juniper Networks, Inc.

We have audited Juniper Networks, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Juniper Networks, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. as of

December 31, 2014

, and


and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

as published in 2013

.

Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of

December 31, 2014

, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, as stated in their report preceding this report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation

Description of Business

Juniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company” or “Juniper”) designs, develops, and sells products and services for high-performance networks, to enable customers to build scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility, efficiency and value through automation. The Company serves the high-performance networking requirements for global service providers, cloud environments, enterprises, governments, and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success. In addition to the Company's products, the Company offers technical support and professional services, as well as education and training programs to its customers. Together, the high-performance product and service offerings help the Company's customers convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation, value, and increased performance, reliability, and security to end-users.

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements, which include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the prior years' Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

In 2014, the Company realigned its organization into a One-Juniper structure which includes consolidating each of the Company's research and development ("R&D") and go-to-market functions to reduce complexity, increase clarity of responsibilities, and improve efficiency. As a result of these changes, the Company's consolidated business is considered to be

one

reportable segment. In fiscal 2013, the Company operated under

two

reportable segments: Platform Systems Division ("PSD") and Software Solutions Division ("SSD"). This change did not impact previously reported consolidated results of operations. See Note 13,

Segments

, for further discussion of the Company's segment reorganization.

Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent there are material differences between the Company's estimates and the actual results, the Company's future consolidated results of operation may be affected.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, highly liquid investments in money market funds, commercial paper, government securities, certificates of deposit, and corporate debt securities, which are readily convertible into cash. All highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of

three months

or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Investments in Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities

The Company's investments in publicly-traded debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at cost and periodically adjusted to fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The Company periodically evaluates its investments to determine if impairment charges are required. The Company considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time the investment has been in a loss position, the extent to which the fair value has been less than the Company's cost basis, the investment's financial condition, and near-term prospects of the investee. If the Company determines that the decline in an investment's fair value is other than temporary, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company's non-qualified compensation plan is invested in mutual funds which are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The realized and unrealized holding gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Privately-Held Investments

The Company has privately-held investments, which are included in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments include debt and redeemable preferred stock securities that are carried at fair value, and non-redeemable preferred stock securities that are carried at cost. The investments carried at cost are adjusted for any impairment, as the Company does not have a controlling interest and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. These investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually in their early stages at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be significant. The Company measures the fair value of privately-held investments using an analysis of the financial conditions and near term prospects of the investees, including recent financing activities and their capital structure. Realized gains and losses, if any, are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it transacts, and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. These inputs are valued using market based approaches.

Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions. These inputs, if any, are valued using internal financial models.

Derivatives

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its market exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

The Company uses foreign currency forward or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Execution of these cash flow hedge derivatives typically occurs every month with maturities of

one year

or less. These derivatives are carried at fair value and the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the costs of services or operating expense line item to which the hedged transaction relates. The Company records any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments in other income (expense), net, on its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows from such hedges are classified as operating activities. All amounts within other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

value of these derivatives are largely offset by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such derivatives are classified as operating activities. These foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of

one year

or less.

Inventory

Inventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and finished goods in-transit, and is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. A charge is recorded to cost of product when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in the newly established cost basis.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives of the following assets:

Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for their intended use.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination or an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recorded. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if certain circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the asset's implied fair value. Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are assessed for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired.

Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. An impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.

The Company amortizes intangible assets with estimable useful lives on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.

The Company generally relies upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.

•

Delivery has occurred.

The Company uses shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance.



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

•

Sales price is fixed or determinable.

The Company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.

•

Collectability is reasonably assured.

The Company assesses collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by its credit checks, their payment histories, or changes in circumstances that indicate that collectability is not reasonably assured.

When sales arrangements contain multiple elements the Company allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on either vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third-party evidence (“TPE”) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (“ESP”) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition. VSOE of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. In determining VSOE, the Company requires that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similar situated customers. However, as the Company's products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and its solutions offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of third-party products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained and therefore TPE is not used. ESP is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles.

In multiple element arrangements where software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when VSOE of fair value of the undelivered items exists. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. If VSOE of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of: (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless maintenance services is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the maintenance service period.

The Company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer-specific return or refund privileges.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria outlined in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time.

A portion of the Company's sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return. As reliable estimates of these credits or returns cannot be made, product revenue on sales made through these distributors is recognized upon sell-through as reported by the distributors to the Company. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits given and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell-through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue.

Service revenues include revenue from maintenance, training, and professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally

one

to

three years

. Revenue from training and professional services is recognized as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is generally

one year

or less.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company's assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews its receivables that remain outstanding past their applicable payment terms and establishes an allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, and age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay.



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Warranty Reserves

The Company generally offers a

one

-year warranty on most of its hardware products, and a


-day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. Warranty costs are recognized as part of the Company's cost of sales based on associated material costs, logistics costs, labor costs, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material costs are estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Labor, logistics and overhead costs are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support customer cases within the warranty period.

Contract Manufacturer Liabilities

The Company establishes a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with its contract manufacturers for carrying charges, quantities in excess of its demand forecasts, or obsolete material charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers to meet the Company’s demand forecast or customer orders. The demand forecasts are based upon historical trends and analysis from the Company's sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions.

Research and Development

Costs to research, design, and develop the Company's products are expensed as incurred.

Software Development Costs

Capitalization of software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed begins when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ends when a product is available for general release to customers. Generally, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. As a result, costs incurred between achieving technological feasibility and product general availability have not been significant.

The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage and are primarily attributable to the Company's enterprise resource planning ("ERP") implementation. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees, who are directly associated with the development of the applications.

Advertising

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Advertising expense was

$19.2 million

,

$20.1 million

, and

$20.0 million

, for


,


, and


, respectively.

Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations with non-U.S. Dollar functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the stockholders’ equity section as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. For the Company’s international subsidiaries in which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the Company records foreign exchange gains and losses for assets and liabilities denominated in non-US dollar currencies. These remeasurement adjustments are recorded in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Loss Contingencies

The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Management considers the likelihood of loss related to an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Share-Based Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes compensation cost for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, stock awards, stock units, and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). Share-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the underlying awards and amortized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures.

The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") shares. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions that represent management's best estimates of volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield. The Company estimates expected volatility based on the implied volatility of market-traded options, on the Company's common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company’s stock options and ESPP. The expected life of a stock option is based on historical experience of employee exercises and post-vesting termination behavior as well as the potential effect from options that have not been exercised. The expected life of ESPP approximates the offering period.

The Company determines the fair value of its restricted stock units ("RSUs"), restricted stock awards ("RSAs"), and performance share awards ("PSAs") based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, adjusted by the present value of the expected dividend.

For market-based RSUs, the Company estimates the fair value and derived service period using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model ("Monte Carlo model"). The determination of the grant date fair value and derived service periods using the Monte Carlo model is affected by our stock price as well as various highly subjective assumptions that represent management's best estimates of volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The Company estimates expected volatility based on the implied volatility of market-traded options, on the Company's common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the contractual life of the Company's market-based RSUs.

Provision for Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than

50%

likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within

one year

. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.

Concentrations of Risk

Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. The Company invests only in high-quality credit instruments and maintains its cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments in fixed income securities with several high-quality institutions. Deposits held with banks, including those held in foreign branches of global banks, may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.

The Company’s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. To mitigate concentration of risk related to its derivatives, the Company establishes counterparty limits to major credit-worthy financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored and the derivatives transacted with these entities are relatively short in duration. Therefore, the Company does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties.

Generally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across different geographic locations throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing

,

no

single customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2012, Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon") accounted for

10.3%

of net revenues.

The Company relies on sole suppliers for certain of its components such as application-specific integrated circuits ("ASICs") and custom sheet metal. Additionally, the Company relies primarily on a limited number of significant independent contract manufacturers and outside design manufacturers for the production of its products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could negatively impact future operating results.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) -

Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items

, which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items.  ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-17 (Topic 805) -

Business Combinations

, which provides an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. ASU 2014-17 is effective on November 18, 2014. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-16 (Topic 815) -

Derivatives and Hedging

, which provides clarification on how current guidance should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. Specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features in evaluating the host contract and that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract ASU 2014-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendment should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the year for which the amendments are effective. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15 (Subtopic 205-40) -

Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

("ASU 2014-15") which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether or not there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12 (Topic 718) -

Compensation - Stock Compensation

("ASU 2014-12") which provides guidance that a performance target that affects vesting of a share-based payment and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is a performance condition. As a result, the target is not reflected in the estimation of the award’s grant date fair value. Compensation cost for such an award would be recognized over the required service period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. ASU 2014-12 is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2014-12 should be applied on a prospective basis to awards that are granted or modified on or after the effective date. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606)

—Revenue from Contracts with Customers

("ASU 2014-09") which provides guidance for revenue recognition. This ASU affects all contracts that the Company enters into with customers to transfer goods and services or for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, and most industry specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. The standard's core principle is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, the Company will need to use additional judgment and estimates than under the existing guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract,



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. Accordingly, the ASU will be effective for the Company beginning fiscal year 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08,

Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity

("ASU 2014-08") which raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. The Company has determined that this pronouncement would not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Note 3. Business Combinations

The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of acquired businesses from the date of each acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented as the financial impact to the Company's consolidated results of operations, both individually and in aggregate, is not material. Additional information, if any, existing as of the acquisition dates but unknown to the Company may become known during the remainder of the measurement period, not to exceed

12 months

from the acquisition date, which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded.

The Company's Level 2 available-for-sale fixed income securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of these assets. The Company's derivative instruments are classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. The Company's policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in a transfer. During the year ended

December 31, 2014

$287.4 million

of government agency bonds within government sponsored enterprise obligations from Level 1 to Level 2 primarily due to the use of additional valuation inputs more appropriately classified as Level 2 inputs. During the year ended

December 31, 2013

, the Company had

no

transfers to Level 3.

All of the Company's privately-held debt securities are classified as Level 3 assets due to the absence of quoted market prices and an inherent lack of liquidity. The Company estimates the fair value of its privately-held debt investments on a recurring basis using an analysis of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, including recent financing activities and the investee's capital structure. During the year ended

December 31, 2014

$5.0 million

related to privately-held debt securities.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain of the Company's assets, including intangible assets, goodwill, and privately-held equity investments, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, only if impairment is indicated. Privately-held equity investments, which are normally carried at cost, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis due to events and circumstances that the Company identified as significantly impacting the fair value of investments. The Company estimates the fair value of its privately-held equity investments using an analysis of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, including recent financing activities and the investee's capital structure.

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

$850.0 million

for its Security reporting unit measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The remeasurement of goodwill is classified as Level 3 value assessment due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. Refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets for further information on the goodwill impairment charge and the unobservable inputs used.

As of December 31, 2014, the Company had no significant privately-held equity investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As of

Note 7. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The following table presents the goodwill activity (in millions):

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for the Company's

three

reporting units: Routing, Switching, and Security. The Company compared each reporting units’ fair value to their current value to determine whether an impairment exists. The fair value was determined by using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.

Under the income approach, the fair value of each reporting unit was based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Cash flow projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rates used were based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimated the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units. The income approach and the market approach were equally weighted to derive the fair value of each reporting unit.

The fair value of the Company’s Routing and Switching reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value. However the fair value of the Security reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value and therefore the Company determined the Security reporting unit’s goodwill was impaired. In 2014, the Company re-aligned its go-to-market and research and development resources on projects with the highest potential for growth and continued to leverage its engineering efforts across its Routing, Switching, and Security products. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company began to implement a new Security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the SRX platform. As a result, the Company rationalized its Security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products, including the divestiture of Junos Pulse. These factors decreased the Company's short term and near term revenue and profitability forecasts of the Security reporting unit.

In determining the impairment amount, the fair value of the Security reporting unit was allocated to its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, based on their respective fair values. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates, customer renewal rates, and technology obsolescence rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets. Based on this allocation, the Security reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of

$850.0 million

which was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

There were

no

impairments to goodwill during the years ended

Note 10. Long-Term Debt and Financing

Long-Term Debt

The following table summarizes the Company's long-term debt (in millions, except percentages):

In March 2011, the Company issued

$300.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.10%

senior notes due


("2016 Notes"),

$300.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.60%

senior notes due


("2021 Notes"), and

$400.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

5.95%

senior notes due


("2041 Notes"). In February 2014, the Company issued

$350.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.50%

senior notes due 2024 ("2024 Notes" and, collectively the "Notes").

The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest on the Notes is payable in cash semiannually. The Company may redeem the Notes, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, subject to a make-whole premium, and, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of the Notes at a purchase price equal to

101%

of the aggregate principle amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture that governs the Notes also contains various covenants, including limitations on the Company's ability to incur liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions over certain dollar thresholds.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, accretion of the discount, and amortization of issuance costs. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants in the indentures governing the Company's notes.

Revolving Credit Facility

On June 27, 2014, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") with certain institutional lenders and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, that provides for a

$500.0 million

unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option of the Company to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional

$200.0 million

, subject to certain conditions. Proceeds of loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used by the Company for working capital and general corporate purposes. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 27, 2019, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. Borrowing may be denominated, at the Company's option in U.S. dollars, Pounds Sterling or Euro.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at either i) a floating rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin of between

0.00%

and

0.50%

, depending on the Company's public debt rating or ii) a per annum rate equal to the reserve adjusted

Eurocurrency rate

, plus a margin of between

0.90%

and

1.50%

, depending on the Company's public debt rating. Base rate is defined as the greatest of (A)

Citibank's base rate

, (B) the

Federal Funds rate

plus

0.50%

or (C) the

ICE Benchmark Administration Settlement Rate

applicable to dollars for a period of one month plus

1.00%

. The Eurocurrency rate is determined for U.S. dollars and Pounds Sterling as the rate at which deposits in such currency are offered in the London interbank market for the applicable interest period and for Euro as the rate specified for deposits in Euro with a maturity comparable to the applicable interest period.

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement, and no amounts were outstanding.

Customer Financing Arrangements

The Company provides certain distribution partners access to extended financing arrangements for certain end-user customers that require longer payment terms than those typically provided by the Company through factoring accounts receivable to third-party financing providers ("financing providers"). The program does not and is not intended to affect the timing of the Company's revenue recognition. Under the financing arrangements, proceeds from the financing provider are due to the Company within


to


days from the sale of the receivable. In these transactions with the financing provider, the Company surrenders control over the transferred assets. The factored accounts receivable are isolated from the Company and put beyond the reach of the Company's creditors, even in the event of bankruptcy. The Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through obligations or rights to redeem, transfer, or repurchase the receivables after they have been transferred. In 2014, the Company transitioned certain distribution partners from the third party financing program to the Company's commercial payment terms. As a result the Company's customer financing activities significantly declined from fiscal year 2013 to 2014.

Pursuant to the financing arrangements for the sale of receivables, the Company sold net receivables of

$440.3 million

,

$898.4 million

and

$677.8 million

during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, respectively.

The Company received cash proceeds from the financing provider of

$602.1 million

,

$843.9 million

, and

$679.8 million

during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, respectively. As of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, the amounts owed by the financing provider were

$28.0 million

and

$189.8 million

, respectively, and were recorded in accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company has provided guarantees to third-party financing companies for certain third-party financing arrangements extended to certain end-user customers, which have terms of up to

four

years. The Company is liable for the aggregate unpaid payments to the third-party financing company in the event of customer default. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company has not been required to make any payments under these arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company has guarantees for third-party financing arrangements of

$22.2 million

as of

December 31, 2014

.

The portion of the receivable financed that has not been recognized as revenue is accounted for as a financing arrangement and is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets

.

As of

December 31, 2014

and 2013, the estimated cash received from the financing provider not recognized as revenue from distributors was

$67.5 million

$2.1 billion

of its common stock, including

$1.2 billion

pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program ("2014 Stock Repurchase Program"). In October 2014, the Board authorized a

$1.3 billion

increase to the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program for a total of $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2014, there was

$1.2 billion

of authorized funds remaining under the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program. In addition to repurchases under the Company’s stock repurchase program, the Company also repurchases common stock from certain employees in connection with the net issuance of shares to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of certain stock awards issued to such employees.

two

separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the "ASR") with

two

financial institutions to repurchase

$1.2 billion

of the Company's common stock. The Company made an up-front payment of

$1.2 billion

pursuant to the ASR to repurchase the Company's common stock. The aggregate number of shares ultimately purchased was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount. The shares received with respect to the ASR have been retired. Retired shares return to authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

The Company intends to repurchase

$1.0 billion

of its common stock by the end of the second quarter of 2015, as part of its three year capital return program. Future share repurchases under the Company’s stock repurchase programs will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The Company's stock repurchase programs may be discontinued at any time. See Note 18,

Valuation Assumptions

The weighted-average assumptions used and the resulting estimates of fair value for stock options, ESPP, and market-based RSUs were as follows:

________________________________

(1)

The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options and ESPP.

(2)

The fair value of market-based RSUs utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model. The Company amortizes the fair value of these awards over the derived service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. Provided that the derived service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant is recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

Share-Based Compensation Expense

Share-based compensation expense associated with stock options, RSUs, RSAs, PSAs, and ESPP was recorded in the following cost and expense categories in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):

The NQDC plan assets are included within short-term investments and offsetting obligations are included within accrued compensation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investments are considered trading securities and are reported at fair value. The realized and unrealized holding gains and losses related to these investments are recorded in other income (expense), net, and the offsetting compensation expense is recorded as operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

against the Company's California and Massachusetts deferred tax assets, respectively, which the Company believes are not more likely than not to be utilized in future years. The remaining deferred tax assets on which the Company recorded a valuation allowance are approximately

$9.6 million

related to losses that are capital in nature and may carry forward to offset future capital gains only. The valuation allowance decreased

$11.2 million

in 2014 related to utilization of losses that are capital in nature offset by the increase in the California R&D credit. Valuation allowance increased in 2013 by

$14.7 million

related to an increase in the California R&D credit.

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had federal and California net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately

$1.6 million

and

$27.8 million

, respectively. The Company also had California tax credit carry-forwards of approximately

$231.9 million

. Approximately

$16.2 million

of the benefit from the California tax credit carry-forwards will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized on the Company's income tax returns. Unused net operating loss carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year 2021. The California tax credit carry-forwards will carry forward indefinitely.

The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. The Company has made no provision for U.S. income taxes on approximately

$1.9 billion

of cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through

December 31, 2014

. These earnings are



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

considered indefinitely invested in operations outside of the U.S., as the Company intends to utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of its international operations. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.

As of

December 31, 2014

,


, and


the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was

$199.2 million

,

$137.6 million

, and

$136.1 million

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately

$164.9 million

of the

$199.2 million

gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows (in millions):

As of

December 31, 2014

,


, and


the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of

$22.3 million

,

$18.4 million

, and

$16.7 million

, respectively, within other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized an expense for net interest and penalties of

$2.8 million

and

$0.6 million

, and a benefit of

$0.6 million

in its Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


, and


, respectively.

The Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. There is a greater than remote likelihood that the balance of the gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately

$3.2 million

within the next twelve months due to lapses of applicable statutes of limitations and the completion of tax review cycles in various tax jurisdictions.

In 2013, the Company executed a closing agreement with the Appeals Division of the IRS related to its intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement for the license of intangibles acquired in 2004, 2005, and 2006. The Company reached a final resolution with the IRS on all proposed adjustments for all tax years through 2006, which resulted in a settlement of approximately

$19.6 million

, including interest.

The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, Juniper Networks or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the Netherlands, U.K., France, Germany, Japan, China, Australia, India, and the U.S. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2004.

The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the 2007 through 2009 tax years and the California Franchise Tax Board for the 2004 through 2006 tax years. The Company is also subject to separate ongoing examinations by the India tax authorities for the 2004 tax year, 2004 through 2008 tax years, and the 2008 through 2010 tax years. The Company is not aware of any other examinations by tax authorities in any other major jurisdictions in which it files income tax returns as of

December 31, 2014

.

In 2008, the Company received a proposed adjustment from the India tax authorities related to the 2004 tax year. In 2009, the India tax authorities commenced a separate investigation of our 2004 through 2008 tax returns and are disputing the Company's determination of taxable income due to the cost basis of certain fixed assets. The Company accrued

$4.6 million

in penalties and interest in 2009 related to this matter. The Company understands that in accordance with the administrative and judicial process



Juniper Networks, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

in India, the Company may be required to make payments that are substantially higher than the amount accrued in order to ultimately settle this issue. The Company strongly believes that any assessment it may receive in excess of the amount accrued would be inconsistent with applicable India tax laws and intends to defend this position vigorously.

The Company is pursuing all available administrative remedies relative to these matters. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these proposed adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations; however there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of these matters could have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Note 15. Net Income per Share

The Company computed basic and diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to Juniper Networks common stockholders as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Basic net income per share is computed using net (loss) income available to common stockholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using net (loss) income available to common stockholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, issuances of ESPP, and vesting of RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs. The Company includes the common shares underlying PSAs in the calculation of diluted net income per share when they become contingently issuable and excludes such shares when they are not contingently issuable. Potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

Operating Leases

The following table summarizes the Company’s future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of

December 31, 2014

(in millions):

The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through

$52.8 million

, and

$63.2 million

, respectively.

Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers

In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the Company's requirements. A significant portion of the Company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments. These purchase commitments totaled

$476.2 million

as of

December 31, 2014

.

The Company establishes a liability in connection with purchase commitments related to quantities in excess of its demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on the Company’s demand forecast or customer orders. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had accrued

$25.3 million

based on its estimate of such charges. This includes

$9.4 million

related to net losses on firm and non-cancelable purchase commitments.

Long-Term Debt and Interest Payment on Long-Term Debt

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company held long-term debt consisting of senior notes with a carrying value of

$1,349.0 million

. Of these Notes,

Long-Term Debt and Financing

, for further discussion of the Company's long-term debt.

Other Contractual Obligations

As of

December 31, 2014

, other contractual obligations primarily consisted of

$46.0 million

in indemnity-related and service related escrows, as required in connection with certain asset purchases and acquisitions completed between 2005 and 2014, campus build-out obligations of

$3.5 million

, and

$19.2 million

of agreements that are firm, non-cancelable and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of payment.

Tax Liabilities

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had

$177.5 million

included in long-term income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.

Guarantees

The Company enters into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. The Company also has financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, custom and duty guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. As of

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, the Company had

$26.2 million

and

$40.1 million

, respectively, in financing arrangements, bank guarantees, and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees, of which

$22.2 million

in financing guarantees was recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2014

. See Note 10,

Long-Term Debt and Financing

, for further discussion of the Company's third-party customer financing arrangements that contain guarantee provisions.

Legal Proceedings

Investigations

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are conducting investigations into possible violations by the Company of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The Company is cooperating with these agencies regarding these matters. The Company’s Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent advisors, has been investigating and conducting a thorough review of possible violations of the FCPA, and has made recommendations for remedial measures, including employee disciplinary actions in foreign jurisdictions, which the Company has implemented and continues to implement. The Company is unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of the SEC and DOJ investigations, but believes that an adverse outcome is reasonably possible. However, the Company is not able to estimate a reasonable range of possible loss. The SEC and/or DOJ could take action against us or we could agree to settle. In such event, we could be required to pay substantial fines and sanctions and/or implement additional remedial measures; in addition, it may be determined that we violated the FCPA.

Other Litigation

In addition to the investigations discussed above, the Company is involved in other disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. The Company is aggressively defending these current litigation matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, and the Company currently believes that none of these existing claims or proceedings are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, if any, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses.

We record an accrual for loss contingencies for legal proceedings when we believe that an unfavorable outcome is both (a) probable and (b) the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable. We have not recorded any accrual for loss contingencies associated with such legal proceedings or the investigations discussed above.
